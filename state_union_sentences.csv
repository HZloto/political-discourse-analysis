1945,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"TRUMAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS April 16, 1945 Mr."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"President, Members of the Congress: It is with a heavy heart that I stand before you, my friends and colleagues, in the Congress of the United States."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Only yesterday, we laid to rest the mortal remains of our beloved President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"At a time like this, words are inadequate."
1945,Truman,Democratic,The most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Yet, in this decisive hour, when world events are moving so rapidly, our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In His infinite wisdom, Almighty God has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved, and was beloved by, all humanity."
1945,Truman,Democratic,No man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"No words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race, creed and color."
1945,Truman,Democratic,The world knows it has lost a heroic champion of justice and freedom.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Tragic fate has thrust upon us grave responsibilities.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We must carry on.Our departed leader never looked backward.
1945,Truman,Democratic,He looked forward and moved forward.
1945,Truman,Democratic,That is what he would want us to do.
1945,Truman,Democratic,That is what America will do.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"So much blood has already been shed for the ideals which we cherish, and for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt lived and died, that we dare not permit even a momentary pause in the hard fight for victory."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Today, the entire world is looking to America for enlightened leadership to peace and progress."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Such a leadership requires vision, courage and tolerance."
1945,Truman,Democratic,It can be provided only by a united nation deeply devoted to the highest ideals.
1945,Truman,Democratic,With great humility I call upon all Americans to help me keep our nation united in defense of those ideals which have been so eloquently proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt.
1945,Truman,Democratic,I want in turn to assure my fellow Americans and all of those who love peace and liberty throughout the world that I will support and defend those ideals with all my strength and all my heart.
1945,Truman,Democratic,That is my duty and I shall not shirk it.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"So that there can be no possible misunderstanding, both Germany and Japan can be certain, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that America will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remains!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,We are deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting is still ahead of us.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Having to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain, America will never become a party to any plan for partial victory!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,To settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of all the world.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Our demand has been, and it remains-Unconditional Surrender!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,We will not traffic with the breakers of the peace on the terms of the peace.
1945,Truman,Democratic,The responsibility for making of the peace-and it is a very grave responsibility-must rest with the defenders of the peace.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We are not unconscious of the dictates of humanity.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We do not wish to see unnecessary or unjustified suffering.
1945,Truman,Democratic,But the laws of Go d and of man have been violated and the guilty must not go unpunished.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Nothing shall shake our determination to punish the war criminals even though we must pursue them to the ends of the earth.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Lasting peace can never be secured if we permit our dangerous opponents to plot future wars with impunity at any mountain retreat - however distant.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In this shrinking world, it is futile to seek safety behind geographical barriers."
1945,Truman,Democratic,Real security will be found only in law and in justice.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Here in America, we have labored long and hard to achieve a social order worthy of our great heritage."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In our time, tremendous progress has been made toward a really democratic way of life."
1945,Truman,Democratic,Let me assure the forward-looking people of America that there w ill be no relaxation in our efforts to improve the lot of the common people.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In the difficult days ahead, unquestionably we shall face problems of staggering proportions."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"However, with the faith of our fathers in our hearts, we do not fear the future."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"On the battlefields, we have frequently faced overwhelming odds - and won!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,"At home, Americans will not be less resolute!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,We shall never cease our struggle to preserve and maintain our American way of life.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"At this moment, America, along with her brave Allies, is paying again a heavy price for the defense of our freedom."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"With characteristic energy, we are assisting in the liberation of entire nations."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Gradually, the shackles of slavery are being broken by t he forces of freedom."
1945,Truman,Democratic,All of us are praying for a speedy victory.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Every day peace is delayed costs a terrible toll.
1945,Truman,Democratic,The armies of liberation today are bringing to an end Hitler's ghastly threat to dominate the world.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Tokyo rocks under the weight of our bombs.
1945,Truman,Democratic,The grand strategy of the United Nations' war has been determined - due in no small measure to the vision of our departed Commander in Chief.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"We are now carrying out our part of that strategy under the able direction of Admiral Leahy, General Marshall, A dmiral King, General Arnold, General Eisenhower, Admiral Nimitz and General MacArthur."
1945,Truman,Democratic,I want the entire world to know that this direction must and will remain-unchanged and unhampered!
1945,Truman,Democratic,Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid.
1945,Truman,Democratic,They have earned our undying gratitude.
1945,Truman,Democratic,America will never forget their sacrifices.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Because of these sacrifices, the dawn of justice and freedom throughout th e world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Our forefathers came to our rugged shores in search of religious tolerance, political freedom and economic opportunity."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"For those fundamental rights, they risked their lives."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"We well know today that such rights can be preserved only by constant vigilance , the eternal price of liberty!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Within an hour after I took the oath of office, I announced that the San Francisco Conference would proceed."
1945,Truman,Democratic,We will face the problems of peace with the same courage that we have faced and mastered the problems of war.
1945,Truman,Democratic,In the memory of those who have made the supreme sacrifice-in the memory of our fallen President-we shall not fail!
1945,Truman,Democratic,It is not enough to yearn for peace.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"We must work, and if necessary, fight for it."
1945,Truman,Democratic,The task of creating a sound international organization is complicated and difficult.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Yet, without such organization, the rights of man on earth cannot be protected."
1945,Truman,Democratic,Machi nery for the just settlement of international differences must be found.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Without such machinery, the entire world will have to remain an armed camp."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"The world will be doomed to deadly conflict, devoid of hope for real peace."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Fortunately, people have retained hope for a durable peace."
1945,Truman,Democratic,Thoughtful people have always had faith that ultimately justice must triumph.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Past experience surely indicates that, without justice, an enduring peace becomes impossible."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In bitter despair, some people have come to believe that wars are inevitable."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"With tragic fatalism, they insist that wars have always been, of necessity, and of necessity wars always will be."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"To such defeatism, men and women of good will must not and can not yield."
1945,Truman,Democratic,The outlook for humanity is not so hopeless.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"During the dark hours of this horrible war, entire nations were kept going by something intangible-hope!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,"When warned that abject submission offered the only salvation against overwhelming power, hope showed the way to victory."
1945,Truman,Democratic,Hope has become the secret weapon of the forces of liberation!
1945,Truman,Democratic,Aggressors could not dominate the human mind.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"As long as hope remains, the spirit of man will never be crushed."
1945,Truman,Democratic,But hope alone was not and is not sufficient to avert war.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We must not only have hope but we must have faith enough to work with other peace-loving nations to maintain the peace.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Hope was not enough to beat back the aggressors as long as the peace-loving nations were unwilling to come to each other's defense.
1945,Truman,Democratic,The aggressors were beaten back only when the peace-loving nations united to defend themselves.
1945,Truman,Democratic,If wars in the future are to be prevented the nations must be united in their determination to keep the peace under law.
1945,Truman,Democratic,Nothing is more essential to the future peace of the world than continued cooperation of the nations which had to muster the force necessary to defeat the conspiracy of the Axis powers to dominate the world.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"While these great states have a special responsibility to enforce the peace, their responsibility is based upon the obligations resting upon all states, large and small, not to use force in international relations except in the defense of law."
1945,Truman,Democratic,The respon sibility of the great states is to serve and not to dominate the world.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"To build a foundation of enduring peace we must not only work in harmony with our friends abroad, but we must have the united support of our own people."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Even the most experienced pilot cannot bring a ship safely into harbor, unless he has the full cooperation of the crew."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"For the benefit of all, every individual must do his duty."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"I appeal to every American, regardless of party, race, creed, or color, to support our efforts to build a strong and lasting United Nations Organization."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"You, the Members of the Congress, surely know how I feel."
1945,Truman,Democratic,Only with your help can I hope to complete one of the greatest tasks ever assigned to a public servant.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"With Divine guidance, and your help, we will find the new passage to a far better world, a kindly and friendly world, with just and lasting peace."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"With confidence, I am depending upon all of you."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"To destroy greedy tyrants with dreams of world domination, we cannot continue in successive generations to sacrifice our finest youth."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In the name of human decency and civilization, a more rational method of deciding national differences must and will be found!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,America must assist suffering humanity back along the path of peaceful progress.
1945,Truman,Democratic,This will require time and tolerance.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"We shall need also an abiding faith in the people, the kind of faith and courage which Franklin Delano Roosevelt always had!"
1945,Truman,Democratic,"Today, America has become one of the most powerful forces for good on earth."
1945,Truman,Democratic,We must keep it so.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We have achieved a world leadership which does not depend solely upon our military and naval might.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We have learned to fight with other nations in common defense of our freedom.
1945,Truman,Democratic,We must now learn to live with other nations for our mutual good.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"We must learn to trade more with other nations so that there may be-for our mutual advantage-increased product ion, increased employment and better standards of living throughout the world."
1945,Truman,Democratic,May we Americans all live up to our glorious heritage.
1945,Truman,Democratic,"In that way, America may well lead the world to peace and prosperity."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"At this moment, I have in my heart a prayer."
1945,Truman,Democratic,"As I have assumed my heavy duties, I humbly pray Almighty God, in the words of King Solomon: ""Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad; for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?"" I ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my Lord and my people."
1946,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1946,Truman,Democratic,TRUMAN'S MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION AND ON THE BUDGET FOR 1946.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"January 21, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Dated January 14, 1946 To the Congress of the United States: A quarter century ago the Congress decided that it could no longer consider the financial programs of the various departments on a piecemeal basis."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Instead it has called on the President to present a comprehensive Executive Budget.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has shown its satisfaction with that method by extending the budget system and tightening its controls.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The bigger and more complex the Federal Program, the more necessary it is for the Chief Executive to submit a single budget for action by the Congress."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At the same time, it is clear that the budgetary program and the general program of the Government are actually inseparable."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The President bears the responsibility for recommending to the Congress a comprehensive set of proposals on all Government activities and their financing.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In formulating policies, as in preparing budgetary estimates mates, the Nation and the Congress have the right to expect the President to adjust and coordinate the views of the various departments and agencies to form a unified program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"And that program requires consideration in connection with the Budget, which is the annual work program of the Government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Since our programs for this period which combines war liquidation with reconversion to a peacetime economy are inevitably large and numerous it is imperative that they be planned and executed with the utmost efficiency and the utmost economy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have cut the war program to the maximum extent consistent with national security.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have held our peacetime programs to the level necessary to our national well-being and the attainment of our postwar objectives.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Where increased programs have been recommended, the increases have been held as low as is consistent with these goals."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I can assure the Congress of the necessity of these programs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I can further assure the Congress that the program as a whole is well within our capacity to finance it.
1946,Truman,Democratic,All the programs I have recommended for action are included in the Budget figures.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For these reasons I have chosen to combine the customary Message on the State of the Union with the annual Budget Message, and to include in the Budget not only estimates for functions authorized by the Congress, but also for those which I recommend for its action."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I am also transmitting herewith the Fifth Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion.1 It is a comprehensive discussion of the present state of the reconversion program and of the immediate and long-range needs and recommendations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This constitutes, then, as complete a report as I find it possible to prepare now."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It constitutes a program of government in relation to the Nation's needs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"With the growing responsibility of modern government to foster economic expansion and to promote conditions that assure full and steady employment opportunities, it has become necessary to formulate and determine the Government program in the light of national economic conditions as a whole."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In both the executive and the legislative branches we must make arrangements which will permit us to formulate the Government program in that light.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Such an approach has become imperative if the American political and economic system is to succeed under the conditions of economic instability and uncertainty which we have to face.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Government needs to assure business, labor, and agriculture that Government policies will take due account of the requirements of a full employment economy."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The lack of that assurance would, I believe, aggravate the economic instability."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"With the passage of a full employment bill which I confidently anticipate for the very near future, the executive and legislative branches of government will be empowered to devote their best talents and resources in subsequent years to preparing and acting on such a program. 1The report dated January 1, 1946, and entitled ""Battle for Production"" is printed in House Document 398 (79th Cong., 2d sess.)."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"FROM WAR TO PEACE-THE YEAR OF DECISION In his last Message on the State of the Union, delivered one year ago, President Roosevelt said: ""This new year of 1945 can be the greatest year of achievement in human history. ""1945 can see the final ending of the Nazi Fascist reign of terror in Europe. ""1945 can see the closing in of the forces of retribution about the center of the malignant power of imperialistic Japan. ""Most important of all-1945 can and must see the substantial beginning of the organization of world peace."" All those hopes, and more, were fulfilled in the year 1945."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It was the greatest year of achievement in human history.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It saw the end of the Nazi-Fascist terror in Europe, and also the end of the malignant power of Japan."
1946,Truman,Democratic,And it saw the substantial beginning of world organization for peace.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These momentous events became realities because of the steadfast purpose of the United Nations and of the forces that fought for freedom under their flags.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The plain fact is that civilization was saved in 1945 by the United Nations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our own part in this accomplishment was not the product of any single service.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Those who fought on land, those who fought on the sea, and those who fought in the air deserve equal credit."
1946,Truman,Democratic,They were supported by other millions in the armed forces who through no fault of their own could not go overseas and who rendered indispensable service in this country.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"They were supported by millions in all levels of government, including many volunteers, whose devoted public service furnished basic organization and leadership."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"They were also supported by the millions of Americans in private life-men and women in industry, in commerce, on the farms, and in all manner of activity on the home front-who contributed their brains and their brawn in arming, equipping, and feeding them."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The country was brought through four years of peril by an effort that was truly national in character.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Everlasting tribute and gratitude will be paid by all Americans to those brave men who did not come back, who will never come back-the 330,000 who died that the Nation might live and progress."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"All Americans will also remain deeply conscious of the obligation owed to that larger number of soldiers, sailors, and marines who suffered wounds and sickness in their service."
1946,Truman,Democratic,They may be certain that their sacrifice will never be forgotten or their needs neglected.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The beginning of the year 1946 finds the United States strong and deservedly confident.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have a record of enormous achievements as a democratic society in solving problems and meeting opportunities as they developed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We find ourselves possessed of immeasurable advantages-vast and varied natural resources; great plants, institutions, and other facilities; unsurpassed technological and managerial skills; an alert, resourceful, and able citizenry."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have in the United States Government rich resources in information, perspective, and facilities for doing whatever may be found necessary to do in giving support and form to the widespread and diversified efforts of all our people."
1946,Truman,Democratic,And for the immediate future the business prospects are generally so favorable that there is danger of such feverish and opportunistic activity that our grave postwar problems may be neglected.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We need to act now with full regard for pitfalls; we need to act with foresight and balance.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We should not be lulled by the immediate alluring prospects into forgetting the fundamental complexity of modern affairs, the catastrophe that can come in this complexity, or the values that can be wrested from it."
1946,Truman,Democratic,But the long-range difficulties we face should no more lead to despair than our immediate business prospects should lead to the optimism which comes from the present short-range prospect.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the foundation of our victory we can build a lasting peace, with greater freedom and security for mankind in our country and throughout the world."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We will more certainly do this if we are constantly aware of the fact that we face crucial issues and prepare now to meet them.
1946,Truman,Democratic,To achieve success will require both boldness in setting our sights and caution in steering our way on an uncharted course.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But we have no luxury of choice.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must move ahead.
1946,Truman,Democratic,No return to the past is possible.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our Nation has always been a land of great opportunities for those people of the world who sought to become part of us.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Now we have become a land of great responsibilities to all the people of all the world.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must squarely recognize and face the fact of those responsibilities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Advances in science, in communication, in transportation, have compressed the world into a community."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The economic and political health of each member of the world community bears directly on the economic and political health of each other member.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The evolution of centuries has brought us to a new era in world history in which manifold relationships between nations must be formalized and developed in new and intricate ways.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The United Nations Organization now being established represents a minimum essential beginning.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It must be developed rapidly and steadily.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Its work must be amplified to fill in the whole pattern that has been outlined.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Economic collaboration, for example, already charted, now must be carried on as carefully and as comprehensively as the political and security measures."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is important that the nations come together as States in the Assembly and in the Security Council and in the other specialized assemblies and councils that have been and will be arranged.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But this is not enough.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our ultimate security requires more than a process of consultation and compromise.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It requires that we begin now to develop the United Nations Organization as the representative of the world as one society.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The United Nations Organization, if we have the will adequately to staff it and to make it work as it should, will provide a great voice to speak constantly and responsibly in terms of world collaboration and world well-being."
1946,Truman,Democratic,There are many new responsibilities for us as we enter into this new international era.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The whole power and will and wisdom of our Government and of our people should be focused to contribute to and to influence international action.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is intricate, continuing business."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Many concessions and adjustments will be required.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The spectacular progress of science in recent years makes these necessities more vivid and urgent.
1946,Truman,Democratic,That progress has speeded internal development and has changed world relationships so fast that we must realize the fact of a new era.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is an era in which affairs have become complex and rich in promise.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Delicate and intricate relationships, involving us all in countless ways, must be carefully considered."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the domestic scene, as well as on the international scene, we must lay a new and better foundation for cooperation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We face a great peacetime venture; the challenging venture of a free enterprise economy making full and effective use of its rich resources and technical advances.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This is a venture in which business, agriculture, and labor have vastly greater opportunities than heretofore."
1946,Truman,Democratic,But they all also have vastly greater responsibilities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We will not measure up to those responsibilities by the simple return to ""normalcy"" that was tried after the last war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The general objective, on the contrary, is to move forward to find the way in time of peace to the full utilization and development of our physical and human resources that were demonstrated so effectively in the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To accomplish this, it is not intended that the Federal Government should do things that can be done as well for the Nation by private enterprise, or by State and local governments."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the contrary, the war has demonstrated how effectively we can organize our productive system and develop the potential abilities of our people by aiding the efforts of private enterprise."
1946,Truman,Democratic,As we move toward one common objective there will be many and urgent problems to meet.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Industrial peace between management and labor will have to be achieved-through the process of collective bargaining-with Government assistance but not Government compulsion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This is a problem which is the concern not only of management, labor, and the Government, but also the concern of every one of us."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Private capital and private management are entitled to adequate reward for efficiency, but business must recognize that its reward results from the employment of the resources of the Nation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Business is a public trust and must adhere to national standards in the conduct of its affairs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These standards include as a minimum the establishment of fair wages and fair employment practices.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Labor also has its own new peacetime responsibilities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Under our collective bargaining system, which must become progressively more secure, labor attains increasing political as well as economic power, and this, as with all power, means increased responsibility."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The lives of millions of veterans and war workers will be greatly affected by the success or failure of our program of war liquidation and reconversion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Their transition to peacetime pursuits will be determined by our efforts to break the bottlenecks in key items of productions, to make surplus property immediately available where it is needed, to maintain an effective national employment service, and many other reconversion policies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our obligations to the people who won the war will not be paid if we fail to prevent inflation and to maintain employment opportunities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"While our peacetime prosperity will be based on the private enterprise system, Government can and must assist in many ways."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is the Government's responsibility to see that our economic system remains competitive, that new businesses have adequate opportunities, and that our national resources are restored and improved."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Government must realize the effect of its operations on the whole economy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is the responsibility of Government to gear its total program to the achievement of full production and full employment.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our basic objective-toward which all others lead-is to improve the welfare of the American people.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition to economic prosperity, this means that we need social security in the fullest sense of the term; the people must be protected from the fear of want during old age, sickness, and unemployment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Opportunities for a good education and adequate medical care must be generally available.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Every family should have a decent home.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The new economic bill of rights to which I have referred on previous occasions is a charter of economic freedom which seeks to assure that all who will may work toward their own security and the general advancement; that we become a well housed people, a well-nourished people, an educated people, a people socially and economically secure, an alert and responsible people."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These and other problems which may face us can be met by the cooperation of all of us in furthering a positive and well balanced Government program-a program which will further national and international well-being.
1946,Truman,Democratic,II.
1946,Truman,Democratic,THE FEDERAL PROGRAM INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 1.
1946,Truman,Democratic,FOREIGN POLICY The year 1945 brought with it the final defeat of our enemies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There lies before us now the work of building a just and enduring peace.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our most immediate task toward that end is to deprive our enemies completely and forever of their power to start another war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Of even greater importance to the preservation of international peace is the need to preserve the wartime agreement of the United Nations and to direct it into the ways of peace.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Long before our enemies surrendered, the foundations had been laid on which to continue this unity in the peace to come."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Atlantic meeting in 1941 and the conferences at Casablanca, Quebec, Moscow, Cairo, Tehran, and Dumbarton Oaks each added a stone to the structure."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Early in 1945, at Yalta, the three major powers broadened and solidified this base of understanding."
1946,Truman,Democratic,There fundamental decisions were reached concerning the occupation and control of Germany.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There also a formula was arrived at for the interim government of the areas in Europe which were rapidly being wrested from Nazi control.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This formula was based on the policy of the United States that people be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely expressed choice without interference from any foreign source.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At Potsdam, in July 1945, Marshal Stalin, Prime Ministers Churchill and Attlee, and I met to exchange views primarily with respect to Germany."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As a result, agreements were reached which outlined broadly the policy to be executed by the Allied Control Council."
1946,Truman,Democratic,At Potsdam there was also established a Council of Foreign Ministers which convened for the first time in London in September.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Council is about to resume its primary assignment of drawing up treaties of peace with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition to these meetings, and in accordance with the agreement at Yalta, the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States conferred together in San Francisco last spring, in Potsdam in July, in London in September, and in Moscow in December."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These meetings have been useful in promoting understanding and agreement among the three governments.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Simply to name all the international meetings and conferences is to suggest the size and complexity of the undertaking to prevent international war in which the United States has now enlisted for the duration of history.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is encouraging to know that the common effort of the United Nations to learn to live together did not cease with the surrender of our enemies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"When difficulties arise among us, the United States does not propose to remove them by sacrificing its ideals or its vital interests."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Neither do we propose, however, to ignore the ideals and vital interests of our friends."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Last February and March an Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace was held in Mexico City.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Among the many significant accomplishments of that Conference was an understanding that an attack by any country against any one of the sovereign American republics would be considered an act of aggression against all of them; and that if such an attack were made or threatened, the American republics would decide jointly, through consultations in which each republic has equal representation, what measures they would take for their mutual protection."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This agreement stipulates that its execution shall be in full accord with the Charter of the United Nations Organization.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The first meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations now in progress in London marks the real beginning of our bold adventure toward the preservation of world peace, to which is bound the dearest hope of men."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have solemnly dedicated ourselves and all our will to the success of the United Nations Organization.
1946,Truman,Democratic,For this reason we have sought to insure that in the peacemaking the smaller nations shall have a voice as well as the larger states.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The agreement reached at Moscow last month preserves this opportunity in the making of peace with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The United States intends to preserve it when the treaties with Germany and Japan are drawn.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It will be the continuing policy of the United States to use all its influence to foster, support, and develop the United Nations Organization in its purpose of preventing international war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,If peace is to endure it must rest upon justice no less than upon power.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The question is how justice among nations is best achieved.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We know from day-to-day experience that the chance for a just solution is immeasurably increased when everyone directly interested is given a voice.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"That does not mean that each must enjoy an equal voice, but it does mean that each must be heard."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Last November, Prime Minister Attlee, Prime Minister MacKenzie King, and I announced our proposal that a commission be established within the framework of the United Nations to explore the problems of effective international control of atomic energy."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Soviet Union, France, and China have joined us in the purpose of introducing in the General Assembly a resolution for the establishment of such a commission."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our earnest wish is that the work of this commission go forward carefully and thoroughly, but with the greatest dispatch."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I have great hope for the development of mutually effective safeguards which will permit the fullest international control of this new atomic force.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I believe it possible that effective means can be developed through the United Nations Organization to prohibit, outlaw, and prevent the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The power which the United States demonstrated during the war is the fact that underlies every phase of our relations with other countries.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We cannot escape the responsibility which it thrusts upon us.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"What we think, plan, say, and do is of profound significance to the future of every corner of the world."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The great and dominant objective of United States foreign policy is to build and preserve a just peace.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The peace we seek is not peace for twenty years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is permanent peace.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At a time when massive changes are occurring with lightning speed throughout the world, it is often difficult to perceive how this central objective is best served in one isolated complex situation or another."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Despite this very real difficulty, there are certain basic propositions to which the United States adheres and to which we shall continue to adhere."
1946,Truman,Democratic,One proposition is that lasting peace requires genuine understanding and active cooperation among the most powerful nations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Another is that even the support of the strongest nations cannot guarantee a peace unless it is infused with the quality of justice for all nations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On October 27, 1945, I made, in New York City, the following public statement of my understanding of the fundamental foreign policy of the United States."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I believe that policy to be in accord with the opinion of the Congress and of the people of the United States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I believe that that policy carries out our fundamental objectives. 1.We seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have no plans for aggression against any other state, large or small."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have no objective which need clash with the peaceful aims of any other nation. 2.We believe in the eventual return of sovereign rights and self government to all peoples who have been deprived of them by force. 3.We shall approve no territorial changes in any friendly part of the world unless they accord with the freely expressed wishes of the people concerned. 4.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We believe that all peoples who are prepared for self-government should be permitted to choose their own form of government by their own freely expressed choice, without interference from any foreign source, That is true in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, as well as in the Western Hemisphere. 5.By the combined and cooperative action of our war allies, we shall help the defeated enemy states establish peaceful democratic governments of their own free choice, And we shall try to attain a world in which nazism, fascism, and military aggression cannot exist. 6.We shall refuse to recognize any government imposed upon any nation by the force of any foreign power."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In some cases it may be impossible to prevent forceful imposition of such a government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But the United States will not recognize any such government. 7.We believe that all nations should have the freedom of the seas and equal rights to the navigation of boundary rivers and waterways and of rivers and waterways which pass through more than one country. 8.We believe that all states which are accepted in the society of nations should have access on equal terms to the trade and the raw materials of the world. 9.We believe that the sovereign states of the Western Hemisphere, without interference from outside the Western Hemisphere, must work together as good neighbors in the solution of their common problems. 10.We believe that full economic collaboration between all nations, great and small, is essential to the improvement of living conditions all over the world, and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from want. 11.We shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and freedom of religion throughout the peace-loving areas of the world. 12.We are convinced that the preservation of peace between nations requires a United Nations Organization composed of all the peace-loving nations of the world who are willing jointly to use force, if necessary, to insure peace."
1946,Truman,Democratic,That is our foreign policy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We may not always fully succeed in our objectives.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There may be instances where the attainment of those objectives is delayed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But we will not give our full sanction and approval to actions which fly in the face of these ideals.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The world has a great stake in the political and economic future of Germany.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Allied Control Council has now been in operation there for a substantial period of time..
1946,Truman,Democratic,It has not met with unqualified success.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The accommodation of varying views of four governments in the day-to-day civil administration of occupied territory is a challenging task.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In my judgment, however, the Council has made encouraging progress in the face of most serious difficulties."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is my purpose at the earliest practicable date to transfer from military to civilian personnel the execution of United States participation in the government of occupied territory in Europe.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We are determined that effective control shall be maintained in Germany until we are satisfied that the German people have regained the right to a place of honor and respect.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the other side of the world, a method of international cooperation has recently been agreed upon for the treatment of Japan."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In this pattern of control, the United States, with the full approval of its partners, has retained primary authority and primary responsibility."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It will continue to do so until the Japanese people, by their own freely expressed choice, choose their own form of government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our basic policy in the Far East is to encourage the development of a strong, independent, united, and democratic China."
1946,Truman,Democratic,That has been the traditional policy of the United States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At Moscow the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Great Britain agreed to further this development by supporting the efforts of the national government and nongovernmental Chinese political elements in bringing about cessation of civil strife and in broadening the basis of representation in the Government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,That is the policy which General Marshall is so ably executing today.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is the purpose of the Government of the United States to proceed as rapidly as is practicable toward the restoration of the sovereignty of Korea and the establishment of a democratic government by the free choice of the people of Korea.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At the threshold of every problem which confronts us today in international affairs is the appalling devastation, hunger, sickness, and pervasive human misery that mark so many areas of the world."
1946,Truman,Democratic,By joining and participating in the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration the United States has directly recognized and assumed an obligation to give such relief assistance as is practicable to millions of innocent and helpless victims of the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has earned the gratitude of the world by generous financial contributions to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have taken the lead, modest though it is, in facilitating under our existing immigration quotas the admission to the United States of refugees and displaced persons from Europe."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have joined with Great Britain in the organization of a commission to study the problem of Palestine.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Commission is already at work and its recommendations will be made at an early date.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The members of the United Nations have paid us the high compliment of choosing the United States as the site of the United Nations headquarters.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We shall be host in spirit as well as in fact, for nowhere does there abide a fiercer determination that this peace shall live than in the hearts of the American people."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is the hope of all Americans that in time future historians will speak not of World War I and World War II, but of the first and last world wars. 2."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY The foreign economic policy of the United States is designed to promote our own prosperity, and at the same time to aid in the restoration and expansion of world markets and to contribute thereby to world peace and world security."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We shall continue our efforts to provide relief from the devastation of war, to alleviate the sufferings of displaced persons, to assist in reconstruction and development, and to promote the expansion of world trade."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have already joined the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have expanded the Export-Import Bank and provided it with additional capital.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has renewed the Trade Agreements Act which provides the necessary framework within which to negotiate a reduction of trade barriers on a reciprocal basis.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It has given our support to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In accordance with the intentions of the Congress, lend-lease, except as to continuing military lend-lease in China, was terminated upon the surrender of Japan."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The first of the lend-lease settlement agreements has been completed with the United Kingdom.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Negotiations with other lend-lease countries are in progress.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In negotiating these agreements, we intend to seek settlements which will not encumber world trade through war debts of a character that proved to be so detrimental to the stability of the world economy after the last war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have taken steps to dispose of the goods which on VJ-day were in the lend-lease pipe line to the various lend-lease countries and to allow them long-term credit for the purpose where necessary.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We are also making arrangments under which those countries may use the lend-lease inventories in their possession and acquire surplus property abroad to assist in their economic rehabilitation and reconstruction.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These goods will be accounted for at fair values.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The proposed loan to the United Kingdom, which I shall recommend to the Congress in a separate message, will contribute to easing the transition problem of one of our major partners in the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will enable the whole sterling area and other countries affiliated with it to resume trade on a multilateral basis.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Extension of this credit will enable the United Kingdom to avoid discriminatory trade arrangements of the type which destroyed freedom of trade during the 1930's.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I consider the progress toward multilateral trade which will be achieved by this agreement to be in itself sufficient warrant for the credit.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The view of this Government is that, in the longer run, our economic prosperity and the prosperity of the whole world are best served by the elimination of artificial barriers to international trade, whether in the form of unreasonable tariffs or tariff preferences or commercial quotas or embargoes or the restrictive practices of cartels."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The United States Government has issued proposals for the expansion of world trade and employment to which the Government of the United Kingdom has given its support on every important issue.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These proposals are intended to form the basis for a trade and employment conference to be held in the middle of this year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If that conference is a success, I feel confident that the way will have been adequately prepared for an expanded and prosperous world trade."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We shall also continue negotiations looking to the full and equitable development of facilities for transportation and communications among nations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The vast majority of the nations of the world have chosen to work together to achieve, on a cooperative basis, world security and world prosperity."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The effort cannot succeed without full cooperation of the United States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To play our part, we must not only resolutely carry out the foreign policies we have adopted but also follow a domestic policy which will maintain full production and employment in the United States."
1946,Truman,Democratic,A serious depression here can disrupt the whole fabric of the world economy. 3.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"OCCUPIED COUNTRIES The major tasks of our Military Establishment in Europe following VE-day, and in the Pacific since the surrender of Japan, have been those of occupation and military government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In addition we have given much needed aid to the peoples of the liberated countries.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The end of the war in Europe found Germany in a chaotic condition.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Organized government had ceased to exist, transportation systems had been wrecked, cities and industrial facilities had been bombed into ruins."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In addition to the tasks of occupation we had to assume all of the functions of government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Great progress has been made in the repatriation of displaced persons and of prisoners of war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of the total of 3,500,000 displaced persons found in the United States zone only 460,000 now remain."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The extensive complications involved by the requirement of dealing with three other governments engaged in occupation and with the governments of liberated countries require intensive work and energetic cooperation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The influx of some 2 million German refugees into our zone of occupation is a pressing problem, making exacting demands upon an already overstrained internal economy."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Improvements in the European economy during 1945 have made it possible for our military authorities to relinquish to the governments of all liberated areas, or to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the responsibility for the provision of food and other civilian relief supplies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Army's responsibilities in Europe extend now only to our zones of occupation in Germany and Austria and to two small areas in northern Italy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"By contrast with Germany, in Japan we have occupied a Country still possessing an organized and Operating governmental system."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Although severely damaged, the Japanese industrial and transportation systems have been able to insure at least a survival existence for the population."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The repatriation of Japanese military and civilian personnel from overseas is proceeding as rapidly as shipping and other means permit.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In order to insure that neither Germany nor Japan will again be in a position to wage aggressive warfare, the armament making potential of these countries is being dismantled and fundamental changes in their social and political structures are being effected."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Democratic systems are being fostered to the end that the voice of the common man may be heard in the councils of his government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,For the first time in history the legal culpability of war makers is being determined.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The trials now in progress in Nurnberg- those soon to begin in Tokyo- bring before the bar of international justice those individuals who are charged with the responsibility for the sufferings of the past six years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have high hope that this public portrayal of the guilt of these evildoers will bring wholesale and permanent revulsion on the part of the masses of our former enemies against war, militarism, aggression, and notions of race superiority. 4."
1946,Truman,Democratic,DEMOBILIZATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES The cessation of active campaigning does not mean that we can completely disband our fighting forces.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For their sake and for the sake of their loved ones at home, I wish that we could."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But we still have the task of clinching the victories we have won- making certain that Germany and Japan can never again wage aggressive warfare, that they will not again have the means to bring on another world war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The performance of that task requires that, together with our allies, we occupy the hostile areas, complete the disarmament of our enemies, and take the necessary measures to see to it that they do not rearm."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As quickly as possible, we are bringing about the reduction of our armed services to the size required for these tasks of occupation and disarmament."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Army and the Navy are following both length-of-service and point systems as far as possible in releasing men and women from the service.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The points are based chiefly on length and character of service, and on the existence of dependents."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Over 5 million from the Army have already passed through the separation centers.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Navy, including the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, has discharged over one and a half million."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of the 12 million men and women serving in the Army and Navy at the time of the surrender of Germany, one-half have already been released."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The greater part of these had to be brought back to this country from distant parts of the world.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Of course there are cases of individual hardship in retention of personnel in the service.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There will be in the future.
1946,Truman,Democratic,No system of such size can operate to perfection.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But the systems are founded on fairness and justice, and they are working at full speed."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We shall try to avoid mistakes, injustices, and hardship as far as humanly possible."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have already reached the point where shipping is no longer the bottleneck in the return of troops from the European theater.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The governing factor now has become the requirement for troops in sufficient strength to carry out their missions.
1946,Truman,Democratic,In a few months the same situation will exist in the Pacific.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"By the end of June, 9 out of 10 who were serving in the armed forces on V-day will have been released."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Demobilization will continue thereafter, but at a slower rate, determined by our military responsibilities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our national safety and the security of the world will require substantial armed forces, particularly in overseas service."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At the same time it is imperative that we relieve those who have already done their duty, and that we relieve them as fast as we can."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To do that, the Army and the Navy are conducting recruiting drives with considerable success."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Army has obtained nearly 400,000 volunteers in the past four months, and the Navy has obtained 80,000."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Eighty percent of these volunteers for the regular service have come from those already with the colors.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has made it possible to offer valuable inducements to those who are eligible for enlistment.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Every effort will be made to enlist the required number of young men.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The War and Navy Departments now estimate that by a year from now we still will need a strength of about 2 million including officers, for the armed forces-Army, Navy, and Air."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I have reviewed their estimates and believe that the safety of the Nation will require the maintenance of an armed strength of this size for the calendar year that is before us.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In case the campaign for volunteers does not produce that number, it will be necessary by additional legislation to extend the Selective Service Act beyond May 16, the date of expiration under existing law."
1946,Truman,Democratic,That is the only way we can get the men and bring back our veterans.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There is no other way.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Action along this line should not be postponed beyond March, in order to avoid uncertainty and disruption."
1946,Truman,Democratic,DOMESTIC AFFAIRS I.
1946,Truman,Democratic,THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Prophets of doom predicted that the United States could not escape a runaway inflation during the war and an economic collapse after the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These predictions have not been borne out.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the contrary, the record of economic stabilization during the war and during the period of reconversion has been an outstanding accomplishment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We know, however, that nothing is as dangerous as overconfidence, in war or in peace."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have had to fight hard to hold the line.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have made strenuous efforts to speed reconversion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But neither the danger of a postwar inflation nor of a subsequent collapse in production and employment is yet overcome.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must base our policies not on unreasoning optimism or pessimism but upon a candid recognition of our objectives and upon a careful analysis of foreseeable trends.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Any precise appraisal of the economic outlook at this time is particularly difficult.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The period of demobilization and reconversion is fraught with uncertainties.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There are also serious gaps in our statistical information.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Certain tendencies are, however, fairly clear and recognition of them should serve as background for the consideration of next year's Federal Program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In general, the outlook for business is good, and it is likely to continue to be good--provided we control inflation and achieve peace in management- labor relations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Civilian production and employment can be expected to increase throughout the next year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This does not mean, however, that continuing full employment is assured."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is probable that demobilization of the armed forces will proceed faster than the increase in civilian employment opportunities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Even if substantial further withdrawals from the labor market occur, unemployment will increase temporarily."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The extent to which this unemployment will persist depends largely on the speed of industrial expansion and the effectiveness of the policies of the Federal Government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Along with extraordinary demand there are still at this time many critical shortages resulting from the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These extraordinary demands and shortages may lead to a speculative boom, especially in the price of securities, real estate, and inventories."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Therefore, our chief worry still is inflation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,While we control this inflationary pressure we must look forward to the time when this extraordinary demand will subside.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will be years before we catch up with the demand for housing.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The extraordinary demand for other durable goods, for the replenishment of inventories, and for exports may be satisfied earlier."
1946,Truman,Democratic,No backlog of demand can exist very long in the face of our tremendous productive capacity.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We must expect again to face the problem of shrinking demand and consequent slackening in sales, production, and employment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This possibility of a deflationary spiral in the future will exist unless we now plan and adopt an effective full employment program. 2.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"GENERAL POLICIES--IMMEDIATE AND LONG-RANGE During the war, production for civilian use was limited by war needs and available manpower."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Economic stabilization required measures to spread limited supplies equitably by rationing, price controls, increased taxes, savings bond campaigns, and credit controls."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Now, with the surrender of our enemies, economic stabilization requires that policies be directed toward promoting an increase in supplies at low unit prices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We must encourage the development of resources and enterprises in all parts of the country, particularly in underdeveloped areas."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For example, the establishment of new peacetime industries in the Western States and in the South would, in my judgment, add to existing production and markets rather than merely bring about a shifting of production."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I am asking the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor to explore jointly methods for stimulating new industries, particularly in areas with surplus agricultural labor."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must also aid small businessmen and particularly veterans who are competent to start their own businesses.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The establishment and development of efficient small business ventures, I believe, will not take away from, but rather will add to, the total business of all enterprises."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Even with maximum encouragement of production, we cannot hope to remove scarcities within a short time."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The most serious deficiencies will persist in the fields of residential housing, building materials, and consumers' durable goods."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The critical situation makes continued rent control, price control, and priorities, allocations, and inventory controls absolutely essential."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Continued control of consumer credit will help to reduce the pressure on prices of durable goods and will also prolong the period during which the backlog demand will be effective.
1946,Truman,Democratic,While we are meeting these immediate needs we must look forward to a long-range program of security and increased standard of living.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The best protection of purchasing power is a policy of full production and full employment opportunities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Obviously, an employed worker is a better customer than an unemployed worker."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"There always will be, however, some frictional unemployment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In the present period of transition we must deal with such temporary unemployment as results from the fact that demobilization will proceed faster than reconversion or industrial expansion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Such temporary unemployment is probably unavoidable in a period of rapid change.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The unemployed worker is a victim of conditions beyond his control.
1946,Truman,Democratic,He should be enabled to maintain a reasonable standard of living for himself and his family.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The most serious difficulty in the path of reconversion and expansion is the establishment of a fair wage structure.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The ability of labor and management to work together, and the wage and price policies which they develop, are social and economic issues of first importance."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Both labor and management have a special interest.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Labor's interest is very direct and personal because working conditions, wages, and prices affect the very life and happiness of the worker and his family."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Management has a no less direct interest because on management rests the responsibility for conducting a growing and prosperous business.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But management and labor have identical interests in the long run.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Good wages mean good markets.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Good business means more jobs and better wages.
1946,Truman,Democratic,In this age of cooperation and in our highly organized economy the problems of one very soon become the problems of all.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Better human relationships are an urgent need to which organized labor and management should address themselves.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"No government policy can make men understand each other, agree, and get along unless they conduct themselves in a way to foster mutual respect and good will."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Government can, however, help to develop machinery which, with the backing of public opinion, will assist labor and management to resolve their disagreements in a peaceful manner and reduce the number and duration of strikes."
1946,Truman,Democratic,All of us realize that productivity--increased output per man--is in the long run the basis of our standard of living.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Management especially must realize that if labor is to work wholeheartedly for an increase in production, workers must be given a just share of increased output in higher wages."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Most industries and most companies have adequate leeway within which to grant substantial wage increases.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These increases will have a direct effect in increasing consumer demand to the high levels needed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Substantial wage increases are good business for business because they assure a large market for their products; substantial wage increases are good business for labor because they increase labor's standard of living; substantial wage increases are good business for the country as a whole because capacity production means an active, healthy, friendly citizenry enjoying the benefits of democracy under our free enterprise system."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Labor and management in many industries have been operating successfully under the Government's wage-price policy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Upward revisions of wage scales have been made in thousands of establishments throughout the Nation since VJ-day.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is estimated that about 6 million workers, or more than 20 percent of all employees in nonagricultural and nongovernmental establishments, have received wage increases since August 18, 1945."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The amounts of increases given by individual employers concentrate between 10 and 15 percent, but range from less than 5 percent to over 30 percent."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The United States Conciliation Service since VJ-day has settled over 3,000 disputes affecting over 1,300,000 workers without a strike threat and has assisted in settling about 1,300 disputes where strikes were threatened which involved about 500,000 workers."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Only workers directly involved, and not those in related industries who might have been indirectly affected, are included in these estimates."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Many of these adjustments have occurred in key industries and would have seemed to us major crises if they had not been settled peaceably.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Within the framework of the wage-price policy there has been definite success, and it is to be expected that this success will continue in a vast majority of the cases arising in the months ahead."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"However, everyone who realizes the extreme need for a swift and orderly reconversion must feel a deep concern about the number of major strikes now in progress."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If long continued, these strikes could put a heavy brake on our program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I have already made recommendations to the Congress as to the procedure best adapted to meeting the threat of work stoppages in Nation-wide industries without sacrificing the fundamental rights of labor to bargain collectively and ultimately to strike in support of their position.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If we manage our economy properly, the future will see us on a level of production half again as high as anything we have ever accomplished in peacetime."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Business can in the future pay higher wages and sell for lower prices than ever before.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This is not true now for all companies, nor will it ever be true for all, but for business generally it is true."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We are relying on all concerned to develop, through collective bargaining, wage structures that are fair to labor, allow for necessary business incentives, and conform with a policy designed to ""hold the line"" on prices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Production and more production was the byword during the war and still is during the transition from war to peace.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"However, when deferred demand slackens, we shall once again face the deflationary dangers which beset this and other countries during the 1930's."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Prosperity can be assured only by a high level of demand supported by high current income; it cannot be sustained by deferred needs and use of accumulated savings.
1946,Truman,Democratic,If we take the right steps in time we can certainly avoid the disastrous excesses of runaway booms and headlong depressions.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must not let a year or two of prosperity lull us into a false feeling of security and a repetition of the mistakes of the 1920's that culminated in the crash of 1929.
1946,Truman,Democratic,During the year ahead the Government will be called upon to act in many important fields of economic policy from taxation and foreign trade to social security and housing.
1946,Truman,Democratic,In every case there will be alternatives.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must choose the alternatives which will best measure up to our need for maintaining production and employment in the future.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must never lose sight of our long-term objectives: the broadening of markets--the maintenance of steadily rising demand.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This demand can come from only three sources: consumers, businesses, or government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In this country the job of production and distribution is in the hands of businessmen, farmers, workers, and professional people -- in the hands of our citizens."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We want to keep it that way.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"However, it is the Government's responsibility to help business, labor, and farmers do their jobs."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"There is no question in my mind that the Government, acting on behalf of all the people, must assume the ultimate responsibility for the economic health of the Nation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,There is no other agency that can.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"No other organization has the scope or the authority, nor is any other agency accountable, to all the people."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This does not mean that the Government has the sole responsibility, nor that it can do the job alone, nor that it can do the job directly."
1946,Truman,Democratic,All of the policies of the Federal Government must be geared to the objective of sustained full production and full employment--to raise consumer purchasing power and to encourage business investment.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The programs we adopt this year and from now on will determine our ability to achieve our objectives.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We must continue to pay particular attention to our fiscal, monetary, and tax policy, programs to aid business--especially small business--and transportation, labor-management relations and wage-price policy, social security and health, education, the farm program, public works, housing and resource development, and economic foreign policy."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For example, the kinds of tax measures we have at different times--whether we raise our revenue in a way to encourage consumer spending and business investment or to discourage it--have a vital bearing on this question."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is affected also by regular notions on consumer credit and by the money market, which is strongly influenced by the rate of interest on Government securities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is affected by almost every step we take.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In short, the way we handle the proper functions of government, the way we time the exercise of our traditional and legitimate governmental functions, has a vital bearing on the economic health of the Nation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These policies are discussed in greater detail in the accompanying Fifth Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion. 3.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"LEGISLATION HERETOFORE RECOMMENDED AND STILL PENDING To attain some of these objectives and to meet the other needs of the United States in the reconversion and postwar period, I have from time to time made various recommendations to the Congress."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In making these recommendations I have indicated the reasons why I deemed them essential for progress at home and abroad.
1946,Truman,Democratic,A few--a very few--of these recommendations have been enacted into law by the Congress.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Most of them have not.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I here reiterate some of them, and discuss others later in this Message."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I urge upon the Congress early consideration of them.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Some are more urgent than others, but all are necessary. (1)Legislation to authorize the President to create fact-finding boards for the prevention of stoppages of work in Nationwide industries after collective bargaining and conciliation and voluntary arbitration have failed--as recommended by me on December 3, 1945. (2)Enactment of a satisfactory full employment bill such as the Senate bill now in conference between the Senate and the House--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (3)Legislation to supplement the unemployment insurance benefits for unemployed workers now provided by the different States--as recommended by me on May 28,1945. (4)Adoption of a permanent Fair Employment Practice Act--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (5)Legislation substantially raising the amount of minimum wages now provided by law--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (6)Legislation providing for a comprehensive program for scientific research--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (7)Legislation enacting a health and medical care program--as recommended by me on November 19, 1945. (8)Legislation adopting the program of universal training--as recommended by me on October 23, 1945. (9)Legislation providing an adequate salary scale for all Government employees in all branches of the Government--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (10)Legislation making provision for succession to the Presidency in the event of the death or incapacity or disqualification of the President and Vice President--as recommended by me on June 19, 1945. (11)Legislation for the unification of the armed services--as recommended by me on December 19, 1945. (12)Legislation for the domestic use and control of atomic energy--as recommended by me on October 3, 1945. (13)Retention of the United States Employment Service in the Federal Government for a period at least up to June 30, 1947--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (14)Legislation to increase unemployment allowances for veterans in line with increases for civilians--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (15)Social security coverage for veterans for their period of military service--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (16)Extension of crop insurance--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (17)Legislation permitting the sale of ships by the Maritime Commission at home and abroad--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I further recommend that this legislation include adequate authority for chartering vessels both here and abroad. (18)Legislation to take care of the stock piling of materials in which the United States is naturally deficient--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (19)Enactment of Federal airport legislation--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (20)Legislation repealing the Johnson Act on foreign loans--as recommended by me on September 6, 1945. (21)Legislation for the development of the Great Lakes-St."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Lawrence River Basin--as recommended by me on October 3, 1945. 4."
1946,Truman,Democratic,POLICIES IN SPECIFIC FIELDS (a)Extension of Price Control Act.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Today inflation is our greatest immediate domestic problem.
1946,Truman,Democratic,So far the fight against inflation has been waged successfully.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Since May 1943, following President Roosevelt's ""hold the line"" order and in the face of the greatest pressures which this country has ever seen, the cost of living index has risen only three percent."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Wholesale prices in this same period have been held to an increase of two and one-half percent.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This record has been made possible by the vigorous efforts of the agencies responsible for this program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But their efforts would have been fruitless if they had not had the solid support of the great masses of our people.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress is to be congratulated for its role in providing the legislation under which this work has been carried out.
1946,Truman,Democratic,On VJ-day it was clear to all thinking people that the danger of inflation was by no means over.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Many of us can remember vividly our disastrous experience following World War I.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Then the very restricted wartime controls were lifted too quickly, and as a result prices and rents moved more rapidly upward."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the year and a half following the armistice, rents, food, and clothing shot to higher and still higher levels."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"When the inevitable crash occurred less than two years after the end of the war, business bankruptcies were widespread."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Profits were wiped out.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Inventory losses amounted to billions of dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Farm income dropped by one-half.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Factory pay rolls dropped 40 percent, and nearly one fifth of all our industrial workers were walking the streets in search of jobs."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This was a grim greeting, indeed, to offer our veterans who had just returned from overseas."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"When I addressed the Congress in September, I emphasized that we must continue to hold the price line until the production of goods caught up with the tremendous demands."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Since then we have seen demonstrated the strength of the inflationary pressures which we have to face.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Retail sales in the closing months of 1945 ran 12 percent above the previous peak for that season, which came in 1944."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Prices throughout the entire economy have been pressing hard against the price ceilings.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The prices of real estate, which cannot now be controlled under the law, are rising rapidly."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Commercial rents are not included in the present price control law and, where they are not controlled by State law, have been increasing, causing difficulties to many businessmen."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will be impossible to maintain a high purchasing power or an expanding production unless we can keep prices at levels which can be met by the vast majority of our people.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Full production is the greatest weapon against inflation, but until we can produce enough goods to meet the threat of inflation the Government will have to exercise its wartime control over prices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I am sure that the people of the United States are disturbed by the demands made by several business groups with regard to price and rent control.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I am particularly disturbed at the effect such thinking may have on production and employment.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If manufacturers continue to hold back goods and decline to submit bids when invited--as I am informed some are doing--in anticipation of higher prices which would follow the end of price controls, we shall inevitably slow down production and create needless unemployment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the other hand, there are the vast majority of American businessmen who are not holding back goods, but who need certainty about the Government pricing policy in order to fix their own long-range pricing policies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Businessmen are entitled therefore to a clear statement of the policy of the Government on the subject.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Tenants and housewives, farmers and workers--consumers in general--have an equal right."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We are all anxious to eliminate unnecessary controls just as rapidly as we can do so.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The steps that we have already taken in many directions toward that end are a clear indication of our policy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The present Price Control Act expires on June 30, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,If we expect to maintain a steady economy we shall have to maintain price and rent control for many months to come.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The inflationary pressures on prices and rents, with relatively few exceptions, are now at an all-time peak."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Unless the Price Control Act is renewed there will be no limit to which our price levels would soar.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our country would face a national disaster.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We cannot wait to renew the act until immediately before it expires.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Inflation results from psychological as well as economic conditions.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The country has a clear right to know where the Congress stands on this all-important problem.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Any uncertainty now as to whether the act will be extended gives rise to price speculation, to withholding of goods from the market in anticipation of rising prices, and to delays in achieving maximum production."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I do not doubt that the Congress will be beset by many groups who will urge that the legislation that I have proposed should either be eliminated or modified to the point where it is nearly useless.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has a clear responsibility to meet this challenge with courage and determination.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I have every confidence that it will do so.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I strongly urge that the Congress now resolve all doubts and as soon as possible adopt legislation continuing rent and price control in effect for a full year from June 30, 1946. (b)Food subsidies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If the price line is to be held, if our people are to be protected against the inflationary dangers which confront us, we must do more than extend the Price Control Act."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In September we were hopeful that the inflationary pressures would by this time have begun to diminish.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We were particularly hopeful on food.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Indeed, it was estimated that food prices at retail would drop from 3 to 5 per cent in the first six months following the end of the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In anticipation of this decline in food prices, it was our belief that food subsidies could be removed gradually during the winter and spring months, and eliminated almost completely by June 30 of this year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It was our feeling that the food subsidies could be dropped without an increase to the consumer in the present level of food prices or in the over-all cost of living.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As matters stand today, however, food prices are pressing hard against the ceilings."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The expected decline in food prices has not occurred, nor is it likely to occur for many months to come."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This brings me to the reluctant conclusion that food subsidies must be continued beyond June 30, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If we fail to take this necessary step, meat prices on July 1 will be from 3 to 5 cents higher than their average present levels; butter will be at least 12 cents a pound higher, in addition to the 5 cents a pound increase of last fall; milk will increase from 1 to 2 cents a quart; bread will increase about 1 cent a loaf; sugar will increase over 1 cent a pound; cheese, in addition to the increase of 4 cents now planned for the latter part of this month, will go up an additional 8 cents."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In terms of percentages we may find the cost-of-living index for food increased by more than 8 percent, which in turn would result in more than a 3-percent increase in the cost of living."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If prices of food were allowed to increase by these amounts, I must make it clear to the Congress that, in my opinion, it would become extremely difficult for us to control the forces of inflation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,None of us likes subsidies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our farmers, in particular, have always been opposed to them."
1946,Truman,Democratic,But I believe our farmers are as deeply conscious as any group in the land of the havoc which inflation can create.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Certainly in the past eighteen months there has been no group which has fought any harder in support of the Government's price control program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I am confident that, if the facts are placed before them and if they see clearly the evils between which we are forced to choose, they will understand the reasons why subsidies must be continued."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The legislation continuing the use of food subsidies into the new fiscal year should be tied down specifically to certain standards.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A very proper requirement, in my opinion, would be that subsidies be removed as soon as it is indicated that the cost of living will decline below the present levels. (c)Extension of War Powers Act."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Second War Powers Act has recently been extended by the Congress for six months instead of for a year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It will now expire, unless further extended, on June 30, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This act is the basis for priority and inventory controls governing the use of scarce materials, as well as for other powers essential to orderly reconversion."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I think that this Administration has given adequate proof of the fact that it desires to eliminate wartime controls as quickly and as expeditiously as possible.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"However, we know that there will continue to be shortages of certain materials caused by the war even after June 30, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is important that businessmen know now that materials in short supply are going to be controlled and distributed fairly as long as these war-born shortages continue.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I, therefore, urge the Congress soon to extend the Second War Powers Act."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We cannot afford to wait until just before the act expires next June.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To wait would cause the controls to break down in a short time, and would hamper our production and employment program. (d)Small business and competition."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A rising birth rate for small business, and a favorable environment for its growth, are not only economic necessities but also important practical demonstrations of opportunity in a democratic free society."
1946,Truman,Democratic,A great many veterans and workers with new skills and experience will want to start in for themselves.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The opportunity must be afforded them to do so.
1946,Truman,Democratic,They are the small businessmen of the future.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Actually when we talk about small business we are talking about almost all of the Nation's individual businesses.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Nine out of every ten concerns fall into this category, and 45 percent of all workers are employed by them."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Between 30 and 40 percent of the total value of all business transactions are handled by small business.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is obvious national policy to foster the sound development of small business.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It helps to maintain high levels of employment and national income and consumption of the goods and services that the Nation can produce.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It encourages the competition that keeps our free enterprise economy vigorous and expanding.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Small business, because of its flexibility, assists in the rapid exploitation of scientific and technological discoveries."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Investment in small business can absorb a large volume of savings that might otherwise not be tapped.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Government should encourage and is encouraging small-business initiative and originality to stimulate progress through competition.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war, the Smaller War Plants Corporation assisted small concerns to make a maximum contribution to victory."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The work of the Smaller War Plants Corporation is being carried on in peacetime by the Federal Loan Agency and the Department of Commerce.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The fundamental approach to the job of encouraging small concerns must be based on: 1.Arrangements for making private and public financial resources available on reasonable terms. 2.Provision of technical advice and assistance to business as a whole on production, research, and management problems."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This will help equalize competitive relationships between large and small companies, for many of the small companies cannot afford expensive technical research, accounting, and tax advice. 3.Elimination of trade practices and agreements which reduce competition and discriminate against new or small enterprises."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We speak a great deal about the free enterprise economy of our country.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is competition that keeps it free.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is competition that keeps it growing and developing.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The truth is that we need far more competition in the future than we have had in the immediate past.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"By strangling competition, monopolistic activity prevents or deters investment in new or expanded production facilities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This lessens the opportunity for employment and chokes off new outlets for idle savings.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Monopoly maintains prices at artificially high levels and reduces consumption which, with lower prices, would rise and support larger production and higher employment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Monopoly, not being subject to competitive pressure, is slow to take advantage of technical advances which would lower prices or improve quality."
1946,Truman,Democratic,All three of these monopolistic activities very directly lower the standard of living--through higher prices and lower quality of product--which free competition would improve.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Federal Government must protect legitimate business and consumers from predatory and monopolistic practices by the vigilant enforcement of regulatory legislation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The program will be designed to have a maximum impact upon monopolistic bottlenecks and unfair competitive practices hindering expansion in employment.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war, enforcement of antimonopoly laws was suspended in a number of fields."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Government must now take major steps not only to maintain enforcement of antitrust laws but to encourage new and competing enterprises in every way.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The deferred demand of the war years and the large accumulations of liquid assets pro- vide ample incentive for expansion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Equalizing of business opportunity, under full and free competition, must be a prime responsibility in the reconversion period and in the years that follow."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Many leading businessmen have recognized the importance of such action both to themselves and to the economy as a whole.
1946,Truman,Democratic,But we must do more than break up trusts and monopolies after they have begun to strangle competition.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We must take positive action to foster new, expanding enterprises."
1946,Truman,Democratic,By legislation and by administration we must take specific steps to discourage the formation or the strengthening of competition-restricting business.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must have an over-all antimonopoly policy which can be applied by all agencies of the Government in exercising the functions assigned to them--a policy designed to encourage the formation and growth of new and freely competitive enterprises.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Among the many departments and agencies which have parts in the program affecting business and competition, the Department of Commerce has a particularly important role."
1946,Truman,Democratic,That is why I have recommended a substantial increase in appropriations for the next fiscal year for this Department.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In its assistance to industry, the Department of Commerce will concentrate its efforts on these primary objectives: Promotion of a large and well-balanced foreign trade; provision of improved technical assistance and management aids, especially for small enterprises; and strengthening of basic statistics on business operations, both by industries and by regions."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To make new inventions and discoveries available more promptly to all businesses, small and large, the Department proposes to expand its own research activities, promote research by universities, improve Patent Office procedures, and develop a greatly expanded system of field offices readily accessible to the businesses they serve."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Many gaps exist in the private financial mechanism, especially in the provision of long-term funds for small and medium-sized enterprises."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In the peacetime economy the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will take the leadership in assuring adequate financing for small enterprises which cannot secure funds from other sources.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Most of the funds should and will be provided by private lenders; but the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will share any unusual risks through guarantees of private loans, with direct loans only when private capital is unwilling to participate on a reasonable basis. (e)Minimum wage."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Full employment and full production may be achieved only by maintaining a level of consumer income far higher than that of the prewar period.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A high level of consumer income will maintain the market for the output of our mills, farms, and factories, which we have demonstrated during the war years that we can produce."
1946,Truman,Democratic,One of the basic steps which the Congress can take to establish a high level of consumer income is to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to raise substandard wages to a decent minimum and to extend similar protection to additional workers who are not covered by the present act.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Substandard wages are bad for business and for the farmer.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Substandard wages provide only a substandard market for the goods and services produced by American industry and agriculture.
1946,Truman,Democratic,At the present time the Fair Labor Standards Act prescribes a minimum wage of 40 cents an hour for those workers who are covered by the act.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The present minimum wage represents an annual income of about $800 to those continuously employed for 50 weeks--clearly a wholly inadequate budget for an American family.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I am in full accord with the proposal now pending in the Congress that the statutory minimum be raised immediately to 65 cents an hour, with further increases to 70 cents after one year and to 75 cents after two years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I also favor the proposal that the industry committee procedure be used to set rates higher than 65 cents per hour during the two-year interval before the 75-cent basic wage would otherwise become applicable.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The proposed minimum wage of 65 cents an hour would assure the worker an annual income of about $1,300 a year in steady employment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This amount is clearly a modest goal.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"After considering cost-of living increases in recent years, it is little more than a 10-cent increase over the present legal minimum."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In fact, if any large number of workers earn less than this amount, we will find it impossible to maintain the levels of purchasing power needed to sustain the stable prosperity which we desire."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Raising the minimum to 75 cents an hour will provide the wage earner with an annual income of $1,500 if he is fully employed."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The proposed higher minimum wage levels are feasible without involving serious price adjustments or serious geographic dislocations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Today about 20 percent of our manufacturing wage earners--or about 2 million-- earn less than 65 cents an hour.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Because wages in most industries have risen during the war, this is about the same as the proportion--17 percent--who were earning less than 40 cents an hour in 1941."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I also recommend that minimum wage protection be extended to several groups of workers not now covered.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The need for a decent standard of living is by no means limited to those workers who happen to be covered by the act as it now stands.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is particularly vital at this period of readjustment in the national economy and readjustment in employment of labor to extend minimum wage protection as far as possible.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Lifting the basic minimum wage is necessary, it is justified as a matter of simple equity to workers, and it will prove not only feasible but also directly beneficial to the Nation's employers. (f)Agricultural programs."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The farmers of America generally are entering the crop year of 1946 in better financial condition than ever before.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Farm mortgage debt is the lowest in 30 years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Farmers' savings are the largest in history.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our agricultural plant is in much better condition than after World War I.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Farm machinery and supplies are expected to be available in larger volume, and farm labor problems will be less acute."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The demand for farm products will continue strong during the next year or two because domestic purchases will be supplemented by a high level of exports and foreign relief shipments.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is currently estimated that from 7 to 10 percent of the total United States food supply may be exported in the calendar year 1946.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Farm prices are expected to remain at least at their present levels in the immediate future, and for at least the next 12 months they are expected to yield a net farm income double the 1935-39 average and higher than in any year prior to 1943."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We can look to the future of agriculture with greater confidence than in many a year in the past.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Agriculture itself is moving confidently ahead, planning for another year of big production, taking definite and positive steps to lead the way toward an economy of abundance."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Agricultural production goals for 1946 call for somewhat greater acreage than actually was planted in 1945.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Agriculture is prepared to demonstrate that it can make a peacetime contribution as great as its contribution toward the winning of the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In spite of supplying our armed forces and our allies during the war with a fifth to a fourth of our total food output, farmers were still able to provide our civilians with 8 percent more food per capita than the average for the five years preceding the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Since the surrender of Japan, civilian food consumption has risen still further."
1946,Truman,Democratic,By the end of 1945 the amount of the increase in food consumption was estimated to be as high as 15 percent over the prewar average.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The record shows that the people of this country want and need more food and that they will buy more food if only they have the jobs and the purchasing power.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The first essential therefore in providing fully for the welfare of agriculture is to maintain full employment and a high level of purchasing power throughout the Nation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,For the period immediately ahead we shall still have the problem of supplying enough food.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If we are to do our part in aiding the war-stricken and starving countries some of the food desires of our own people will not be completely satisfied, at least until these nations have had an opportunity to harvest another crop."
1946,Truman,Democratic,During the next few months the need for food in the world will be more serious than at any time during the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"And, despite the large shipments we have already made, and despite what we shall send, there remain great needs abroad."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Beyond the relief feeding period, there will still be substantial foreign outlets for our farm commodities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The chief dependence of the farmer, however, as always, must be upon the buying power of our own people."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The first obligation of the Government to agriculture for the reconversion period is to make good on its price-support commitments.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This we intend to do, with realistic consideration for the sound patterns of production that will contribute most to the long-time welfare of agriculture and the whole Nation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The period during which prices are supported will provide an opportunity for farmers individually to strengthen their position in changing over from a wartime to a peacetime basis of production.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will provide an opportunity for the Congress to review the needs of agriculture and make changes in national legislation where experience has shown changes to be needed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In this connection, the Congress will wish to consider legislation to take the place of the 1937 Sugar Act which expires at the end of this year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,During this period we must do a thorough job of basic planning to the end that agriculture shall be able to contribute its full share toward a healthy national economy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our long-range agricultural policies should have two main objectives: First, to assure the people on the farms a fair share of the national income; and, second, to encourage an agricultural production pattern that is best fitted to the Nation's needs."
1946,Truman,Democratic,To accomplish this second objective we shall have to take into consideration changes that have taken place and will continue to take place in the production of farm commodities--changes that affect costs and efficiency and volume.
1946,Truman,Democratic,What we seek ultimately is a high level of food production and consumption that will provide good nutrition for everyone.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This cannot be accomplished by agriculture alone.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We can be certain of our capacity to produce food, but we have often failed to distribute it as well as we should and to see that our people can afford to buy it."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The way to get good nutrition for the whole Nation is to provide employment opportunities and purchasing power for all groups that will enable them to buy full diets at market prices.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Wherever purchasing power fails to reach this level we should see that they have some means of getting adequate food at prices in line with their ability to buy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Therefore, we should have available supplementary programs that will enable all our people to have enough of the right kind of food."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For example, one of the best possible contributions toward building a stronger, healthier Nation would be a permanent school-lunch program on a scale adequate to assure every school child a good lunch at noon."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Congress, of course, has recognized this need for a continuing school-lunch program and legislation to that effect has been introduced and hearings held."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The plan contemplates the attainment of this objective with a minimum of Federal expenditures.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I hope that the legislation will be enacted in time for a permanent program to start with the beginning of the school year next fall.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have the technical knowledge and the productive capacity to provide plenty of good food for every man, woman, and child in the United States."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is time we made that possibility a reality. (g)Resource development.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The strength of our Nation and the welfare of the people rest upon the natural resources of the country.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have learned that proper conservation of our lands, including our forests and minerals, and wise management of our waters will add immensely to our national wealth."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The first step in the Government's conservation program must be to find out just what are our basic resources, and how they should be used."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We need to take, as soon as possible, an inventory of the lands, the minerals, and the forests of the Nation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war it was necessary to curtail some of our long-range plans for development of our natural resources, and to emphasize programs vital to the prosecution of the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Work was suspended on a number of flood control and reclamation projects and on the development of our national forests and parks.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This work must now be resumed, and new projects must be undertaken to provide essential services and to assist in the process of economic development."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The rivers of America offer a great opportunity to our generation in the management of the national wealth.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"By a wise use of Federal funds, most of which will be repaid into the Treasury, the scourge of floods and drought can be curbed, water can be brought to arid lands, navigation can be extended, and cheap power can be brought alike to the farms and to the industries of our land."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Through the use of the waters of the Columbia River, for example, we are creating a rich agricultural area as large as the State of Delaware."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At the same time, we are producing power at Grand Coulee and at Bonneville which played a mighty part in winning the war and which will found a great peacetime industry in the Northwest."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Tennessee Valley Authority will resume its peacetime program of promoting full use of the resources of the Valley.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We shall continue our plans for the development of the Missouri Valley, the Arkansas Valley, and the Central Valley of California."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has shown itself alive to the practical requirements for a beneficial use of our water resources by providing that preference in the sale of power be given to farmers' cooperatives and public agencies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The public power program thus authorized must continue to be made effective by building the necessary generating and transmission facilities to furnish the maximum of firm power needed at the wholesale markets, which are often distant from the dam sites."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These great developmental projects will open the frontiers of agriculture, industry, and commerce."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The employment opportunities thus offered will also go far to ease the transition from war to peace. (h)Public works.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war even urgently needed Federal, State, and local construction projects were deferred in order to release resources for war production."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In resuming public works construction, it is desirable to proceed only at a moderate rate, since demand for private construction will be abnormally high for some time."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our public works program should be timed to reach its peak after demand for private construction has begun to taper off.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Meanwhile, however, plans should be prepared if we are to act promptly when the present extraordinary private demand begins to run out."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress made money available to Federal agencies for their public works planning in the fiscal year 1946.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I strongly recommend that this policy be continued and extended in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,State and local governments have an essential role to play in a national public works program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In my message of September 6, 1945,I recommended that the Congress vote such grants to State and local governments as will insure that each level of government makes its proper contribution to a balanced public construction program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Specifically, the Federal Government should aid State and local governments in planning their own public works programs, in undertaking projects related to Federal programs of regional development, and in constructing such public works as are necessary to carry out the various policies of the Federal Government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Early in 1945 the Congress made available advances to State and local governments for planning public works projects, and recently made additional provision to continue these advances through the fiscal year 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I believe that further appropriations will be needed for the same purpose for the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has already made provision for highway programs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is now considering legislation which would expand Federal grants and loans in several other fields, including construction of airports, hospital and health centers, housing, water pollution control facilities, and educational plant facilities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I hope that early action will be taken to authorize these Federal programs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"With respect to public works of strictly local importance, State and local governments should proceed without Federal assistance except in planning."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This rule should be subject to review when and if the prospect of highly adverse general economic developments warrants it.
1946,Truman,Democratic,All loans and grants for public works should be planned and administered in such a way that they are brought into accord with the other elements of the Federal Program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our long-run objective is to achieve a program of direct Federal and Federally assisted public works which is planned in advance and synchronized with business conditions.
1946,Truman,Democratic,In this way it can make its greatest contribution to general economic stability. (i)National housing program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Last September I stated in my message to the Congress that housing was high on the list of matters calling for decisive action.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Since then the housing shortage in countless communities, affecting millions of families, has magnified this call to action."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Today we face both an immediate emergency and a major postwar problem.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Since VJ-day the wartime housing shortage has been growing steadily worse and pressure on real estate values has increased.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Returning veterans often cannot find a satisfactory place for their families to live, and many who buy have to pay exorbitant prices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Rapid demobilization inevitably means further overcrowding.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A realistic and practical attack on the emergency will require aggressive action by local governments, with Federal aid, to exploit all opportunities and to give the veterans as far as possible first chance at vacancies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will require continuation of rent control in shortage areas as well as legislation to permit control of sales prices.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will require maximum conversion of temporary war units for veterans' housing and their transportation to communities with the most pressing needs; the Congress has already appropriated funds for this purpose.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The inflation in the price of housing is growing daily.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As a result of the housing shortage, it is inevitable that the present dangers of inflation in home values will continue unless the Congress takes action in the immediate future."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Legislation is now pending in the Congress which would provide for ceiling prices for old and new houses.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The authority to fix such ceilings is essential.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"With such authority, our veterans and other prospective home owners would be protected against a skyrocketing of home prices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The country would be protected from the extension of the present inflation in home values which, if allowed to continue, will threaten not only the stabilization program but our opportunities for attaining a sustained high level of home construction."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Such measures are necessary stopgaps--but only stopgaps.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This emergency action, taken alone, is good--but not enough."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The housing shortage did not start with the war or with demobilization; it began years before that and has steadily accumulated.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The speed with which the Congress establishes the foundation for a permanent, long-range housing program will determine how effectively we grasp the immense opportunity to achieve our goal of decent housing and to make housing a major instrument of continuing prosperity and full employment in the years ahead."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It will determine whether we move forward to a stable and healthy housing enterprise and toward providing a decent home for every American family.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Production is the only fully effective answer.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To get the wheels turning, I have appointed an emergency housing expediter."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I have approved establishment of priorities designed to assure an ample share of scarce materials to builders of houses for which veterans will have preference.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Additional price and wage adjustments will be made where necessary, and other steps will be taken to stimulate greater production of bottleneck items."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I recommend consideration of every sound method for expansion in facilities for insurance of privately financed housing by the Federal Housing Administration and resumption of previously authorized low-rent public housing projects suspended during the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In order to meet as many demands of the emergency situation as possible, a program of emergency measures is now being formulated for action."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These will include steps in addition to those already taken.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As quickly as this program can be formulated, announcement will be made."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Last September I also outlined to the Congress the basic principles for the kind of decisive, permanent legislation necessary for a long-range housing program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These principles place paramount the fact that housing construction and financing for the overwhelming majority of our citizens should be done by private enterprise.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"They contemplate also that we afford governmental encouragement to privately financed house construction for families of moderate income, through extension of the successful system of insurance of housing investment; that research be undertaken to develop better and cheaper methods of building homes; that communities be assisted in appraising their housing needs; that we commence a program of Federal aid, with fair local participation, to stimulate and promote the rebuilding and redevelopment of slums and blighted areas--with maximum use of private capital."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is equally essential that we use public funds to assist families of low income who could not otherwise enjoy adequate housing, and that we quicken our rate of progress in rural housing."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Legislation now under consideration by the Congress provides for a comprehensive attack jointly by private enterprise, State and local authorities, and the Federal Government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This legislation would make permanent the National Housing Agency and give it authority and funds for much needed technical and economic research.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It would provide additional stimulus for privately financed housing construction.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This stimulus consists of establishing a new system of yield insurance to encourage large-scale investment in rental housing and broadening the insuring powers of the Federal Housing Administration and the lending powers of the Federal savings and loan associations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Where private industry cannot build, the Government must step in to do the job."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The bill would encourage expansion in housing available for the lowest income groups by continuing to provide direct subsidies for low-rent housing and rural housing.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It would facilitate land assembly for urban redevelopment by loans and contributions to local public agencies where the localities do their share.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Prompt enactment of permanent housing legislation along these lines will not interfere with the emergency action already under way.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the contrary, it would lift us out of a potentially perpetual state of housing emergency."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It would offer the best hope and prospect to millions of veterans and other American families that the American system can offer more to them than temporary makeshifts.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I have said before that the people of the United States can be the best housed people in the world.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I repeat that assertion, and I welcome the cooperation of the Congress in achieving that goal. (j)Social security and health."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our Social Security System has just celebrated its tenth anniversary.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the past decade this program has supported the welfare and morale of a large part of our people by removing some of the hazards and hardships of the aged, the unemployed, and widows and dependent children."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But, looking back over 10 years' experience and ahead to the future, we cannot fail to see defects and serious inadequacies in our system as it now exists."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Benefits are in many cases inadequate; a great many persons are excluded from coverage; and provision has not been made for social insurance to cover the cost of medical care and the earnings lost by the sick and the disabled.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the field of old-age security, there seems to be no adequate reason for excluding such groups as the self-employed, agricultural and domestic workers, and employees of non-profit organizations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Since many of these groups earn wages too low to permit significant savings for old age, they are in special need of the assured income that can be provided by old-age insurance."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must take urgent measures for the readjustment period ahead.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Congress for some time has been considering legislation designed to supplement at Federal expense, during the immediate reconversion period, compensation payments to the unemployed."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Again I urge the Congress to enact legislation liberalizing unemployment compensation benefits and extending the coverage.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Providing for the sustained consumption by the unemployed persons and their families is more than a welfare policy; it is sound economic policy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,A sustained high level of consumer purchases is a basic ingredient of a prosperous economy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war, nearly 5 million men were rejected for military service because of physical or mental defects which in many cases might have been prevented or corrected."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This is shocking evidence that large sections of the population are at substandard levels of health.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The need for a program that will give everyone opportunity for medical care is obvious.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Nor can there be any serious doubt of the Government's responsibility for helping in this human and social problem.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The comprehensive health program which I recommended on November 19, 1945, will require substantial additions to the Social Security System and, in conjunction with other changes that need to be made, will require further consideration of the financial basis for social security."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The system of prepaid medical care which I have recommended is expected eventually to require amounts equivalent to 4 percent of earnings up to $3,600 a year, which is about the average of present expenditures by individuals for medical care."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The pooling of medical costs, under a plan which permits each individual to make a free choice of doctor and hospital, would assure that individuals receive adequate treatment and hospitalization when they are faced with emergencies for which they cannot budget individually."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, I recommended insurance benefits to replace part of the earnings lost through temporary sickness and permanent disability."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Even without these proposed major additions, it would now be time to undertake a thorough reconsideration of our social security laws."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The structure should be expanded and liberalized.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Provision should be made for extending coverage credit to veterans for the period of their service in the armed forces.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the financial provisions we must reconcile the actuarial needs of social security, including health insurance, with the requirements of a revenue system that is designed to promote a high level of consumption and full employment. (k)Education."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Although the major responsibility for financing education rests with the States, some assistance has long been given by the Federal Government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Further assistance is desirable and essential.
1946,Truman,Democratic,There are many areas and some whole States where good schools cannot be provided without imposing an undue local tax burden on the citizens.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is essential to provide adequate elementary and secondary schools everywhere, and additional educational opportunities for large numbers of people beyond the secondary level."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Accordingly, I repeat the proposal of last year's Budget Message that the Federal Government provide financial aid to assist the States in assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good education."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The proposed Federal grants for current educational expenditures should be made for the purpose of improving the educational systern where improvement is most needed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"They should not be used to replace existing non-Federal expenditures, or even to restore merely the situation which existed before the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In the future we expect incomes considerably higher than before the war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Higher incomes should make it possible for State and local governments and for individuals to support higher and more nearly adequate expenditures for education.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But inequality among the States will still remain, and Federal help will still be needed."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As a part of our total public works program, consideration should be given to the need for providing adequate buildings for schools and other educational institutions."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In view of current arrears in the construction of educational facilities, I believe that legislation to authorize grants for educational facilities, to be matched by similar expenditures by State and local authorities, should receive the favorable consideration of the Congress."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Federal Government has not sought, and will not seek, to dominate education in the States."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It should continue its historic role of leadership and advice and, for the purpose of equalizing educational opportunity, it should extend further financial support to the cause of education in areas where this is desirable. (l)Federal Government personnel."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The rapid reconversion of the Federal Government from war to peace is reflected in the demobilization of its civilian personnel.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The number of these employees in continental United States has been reduced by more than 500,000 from the total of approximately 2,900,000 employed in the final months of the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I expect that by next June we shall have made a further reduction of equal magnitude and that there will be continuing reductions during the next fiscal year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of the special wartime agencies now remaining, only a few are expected to continue actively into the next fiscal year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At the same time that we have curtailed the number of employees, we have shortened the workweek by one-sixth or more throughout the Government and have restored holidays."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The process of readjustment has been complicated and costs have been increased by a heavy turn-over in the remaining personnel-particularly by the loss of some of our best administrators.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Thousands of war veterans have been reinstated or newly employed in the civil service.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Many civilians have been transferred from war agencies to their former peacetime agencies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Recruitment standards, which had to be relaxed during the war, are now being tightened."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The elimination last autumn of overtime work for nearly all Federal employees meant a sharp cut in their incomes.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For salaried workers, the blow was softened but by no means offset by the increased rates of pay which had become effective July 1."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Further adjustments to compensate for increased living costs are required.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Moreover, we have long needed a general upward revision of Federal Government salary scales at all levels in all branches-legislative, judicial, and executive."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Too many in Government have had to sacrifice too much in economic advantage to serve the Nation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Adequate salaries will result in economies and improved efficiency in the conduct of Government business-gains that will far outweigh the immediate costs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I hope the Congress will expedite action on salary legislation for all Federal employees in all branches of the Government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The only exception I would make is in the case of workers whose pay rates are established by wage boards; a blanket adjustment would destroy the system by which their wages are kept aligned with prevailing rates in particular localities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The wage boards should he sensitive now, as they were during the war, to changes in local prevailing wage rates and should make adjustments I hope also that the Congress may see fit to enact legislation for the adequate protection of the health and safety of Federal employees, for their coverage under a system of unemployment compensation, and for their return at Government expense to their homes after separation from wartime service. (m)Territories, insular possessions, and the District of Columbia."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The major governments of the world face few problems as important and as perplexing as those relating to dependent peoples.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This Government is committed to the democratic principle that it is for the dependent peoples themselves to decide what their status shall be.
1946,Truman,Democratic,To this end I asked the Congress last October to provide a means by which the people of Puerto Rico might choose their form of government and ultimate status with respect to the United States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I urge, too, that the Congress promptly accede to the wishes of the people of Hawaii that the Territory be admitted to statehood in our Union, and that similar action be taken with respect to Alaska as soon as it is certain that this is the desire of the people of that great Territory."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The people of the Virgin Islands should be given an increasing measure of self-government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have already determined that the Philippine Islands are to be independent on July 4, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The ravages of war and enemy occupation, however, have placed a heavy responsibility upon the United States."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I urge that the Congress complete, as promptly and as generously as may be possible, legislation which will aid economic rehabilitation for the Philippines."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This will be not only a just acknowledgment of the loyalty of the people of the Philippines, but it will help to avoid the economic chaos which otherwise will he their heritage from our common war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Perhaps no event in the long centuries of colonialism gives more hope for the pattern of the future than the independence of the Philippines.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The District of Columbia, because of its special relation to the Federal Government, has been treated since 18oo as a dependent area."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We should move toward a greater measure of local self-government consistent with the constitutional status of the District.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We should take adequate steps to assure that citizens of the United States are not denied their franchise merely because they reside at the Nation's Capital.
1946,Truman,Democratic,III.
1946,Truman,Democratic,THE BUDGET FOR THE FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1947 SUMMARY OF THE BUDGET For the first time since the fiscal year 1930 the Budget for the next fiscal year will require no increase in the national debt.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenditures of all kinds, authorized and recommended, in the next year are estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Net receipts are estimated at 31.5 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The estimated difference of 4.3 billion dollars will be met by a reduction in the very substantial balance which will be in the Treasury during the next fiscal year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A large part of the activities outside defense and war liquidation, aftermath of war, and international finance, classified as ""other activities in a following table, is still due to repercussions of the war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These ""other activities include more than 2 billion dollars for aids to agriculture and net outlays for the Commodity Credit Corporation--almost double the expenditures for the same purposes in prewar years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This increase is due mainly to expenditures for purposes of price stabilization and price support resulting from the war food production program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Other increases in this category are due to the fact that certain wartime agencies now in the process of liquidation are included in this group of activities.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If all expenditures for those activities which are directly or indirectly related to the war are excluded, the residual expenditures are below those for corresponding activities in prewar years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In making this comparison account should be taken of the fact that, while prewar expenditures were affected by direct relief and work relief for the unemployed, the postwar budgets are affected by the considerable increase in pay rates and other increases in costs and prices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To elaborate, the Budget, as I have remarked above, reflects on both sides of the ledger the Government's program as recommended by the Executive."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It includes estimates not only of expenditures and receipts for which legislative authority already exists, but also of expenditures and receipts for which authorization is recommended."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Budget total for the next fiscal year, the year that ends on June 30, 1947, is estimated at just above 35.8 billion dollars--about a third of the budgets for global war, although nearly four times the prewar budgets."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This estimate is based on the assumption that a rapid liquidation of the war program will be associated with rapid reconversion and expansion of peacetime production.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The total includes net outlays of Government corporations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The estimated expenditures in the next and current fiscal year compare as follows with those of a year of global war and a prewar year: TOTAL BUDGET EXPENDITURES Fiscal year: (in millions) 1947 $35,860 1946 67,229 1945 100,031 1940 9,252 Although allowances for occupation, demobilization, and defense are drastically reduced in the fiscal year 1947, they will still amount to 42 percent of the total Budget."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The so-called ""aftermath of war"" expenditures account for a further 30 percent of the total."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The total of all other programs, which was drastically cut during the war, is increasing again as liquidation of the war program proceeds and renewed emphasis is placed on the peacetime objectives of the Government."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the other side of the ledger, net receipts are estimated at 31.5 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This estimate assumes that all existing taxes will continue all through the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Included are the extraordinary receipts from the disposal of surplus property.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As a result, estimated expenditures will exceed estimated receipts by 4.3 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This amount can be provided by a reduction in the cash balance in the Treasury.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Thus, after a long period of increasing public debt resulting from depression budgets and war budgets, it is anticipated that no increase in the Federal debt will he required next year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The current fiscal year, 1946, is a year of transition."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"When the year opened, in July 1945, we were still fighting a major war, and Federal expenditures were running at an annual rate of about 100 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,By June 1946 that rate will be more than cut in half.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Budget total for the current fiscal year is now estimated at 67.2 billion dollars, of which more than two-thirds provides for war and war liquidation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Since net receipts are estimated at 38.6 billion dollars, there will be an excess of expenditures of 28.6 billion dollars for the current fiscal year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For all programs discussed in this Message I estimate the total of Budget appropriations and authorizations (including reappropriations and permanent appropriations) at 30,982 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of this amount, present permanent appropriations are expected to provide 5,755 million dollars, principally for interest."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This leaves 24,224 million dollars to be made available through new appropriations, exclusive of appropriations to liquidate contract authorizations; 900 million dollars in new contract authorizations; and 103 million dollars through the reappropriation of unliquidated balances of previous appropriations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The appropriations needed to liquidate contract authorizations are estimated at 1,113 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In the Budget for the year ahead only over-all estimates are included at this time for the major war agencies and for net outlays of Government corporations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Detailed recommendations will be transmitted in the spring for the war agencies; and the business-type budgets of Government corporations will likewise be transmitted in accordance with the recently adopted Government Corporation Control Act.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Similarly, only overall estimates are provided for new programs recommended in this Message; detailed recommendations will be transmitted after authorizing legislation has been enacted."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It should be recognized that many of the estimates for new programs recommended in this Message are initial year figures.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These figures will be affected by the date the legislation is enacted and by the time needed for getting a program under way.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"New programs, such as that for a national research agency, will require larger amounts in later years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The estimates exclude major elements of the proposed national health program since the greater part of these will be covered by expenditures from trust funds.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Budget total includes expenditures for capital outlay as well as for current operations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"An estimated 1,740 million dollars will be expended in the fiscal year 1947 for direct Federal public works and for loans and grants for public works."
1946,Truman,Democratic,THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF THE WAR PROGRAM Government programs are of such importance in the development of production and employment opportunities-domestic and international--that it has become essential to formulate and consider the Federal Budget in the light of the Nation's budget as a whole.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The relationship between the receipts, expenditures, and savings of consumers, business, and government is shown in the accompanying table."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Considering the whole Nation, total expenditures must equal the total receipts, because what any individual or group spends becomes receipts of other individuals or groups."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Such equality can he achieved on either a high level of incomes or on a low or depression level of incomes.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Tremendous orders for munitions during the war shifted production and employment into high gear.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Total goods produced and services rendered for private as well as for Government purposes--the Nation's budget--reached about 200 billion dollars in the calendar year 1944.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Federal, State, and local government expenditures represented half of this total."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Corresponding estimates for the past 3 months depict the national economy in the process of demobilization and reconversion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The wartime annual rate of Federal expenditures has been reduced by 32 billion dollars, while the Nation's budget total has dropped only half as much."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The drop in total value of production and services has been less drastic because increasing private activities have absorbed in large measure the manpower and materials released from war production and war services.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The largest increase in private activities has occurred in business investments, which include residential and other construction, producers' durable equipment, accumulation of inventories, and net exports."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Under conditions of global war, expenditures for private construction and equipment were held to a minimum and inventories were depleted."
1946,Truman,Democratic,With the beginning of reconversion these developments have been reversed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Residential construction and outlays for plant and equipment are on the increase; inventories, too, are being replenished."
1946,Truman,Democratic,International transactions (excluding landless and international relief which are included under war expenditures) showed an import surplus under conditions of global war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the past 3 months private exports have been slightly in excess of imports, for the first time since 1941."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Consumers' budgets show a significant change.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the income side, their total has declined but little because the reduction in ""take-home"" pay of war workers is, to a large extent, offset for the time being by the mustering-out payments received by war veterans and by unemployment compensation received by the unemployed."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the expenditure side, however, consumers budgets, restricted during the war, have increased substantially as a result of the fact that scarce goods are beginning to appear on the market and wartime restraints are disappearing."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Thus, consumers' current savings are declining substantially from the extraordinarily high wartime rate and some wartime savings are beginning to be used for long-delayed purchases."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Unemployment has increased less than was expected during this first period of demobilization and reconversion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is true that 6 million men and women have been discharged from the armed forces since May 1945 and more than 5 million have been laid off from war work.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the other hand, more than a million civilians have been enlisted in the armed forces, a considerable number of war veterans have not immediately sought jobs, and many war workers, especially women, have withdrawn from the labor force."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, many industries, and especially service trades which were undermanned during the war, are beginning now, for the first time in years, to recruit an adequate labor force."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The reduced workweek has also contributed to the absorption of those released from war service and war work.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In general, the drastic cut in war programs has thrown the economy into lower gear; it has not thrown it out of gear."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our economic machine demonstrates remarkable resiliency, although there are many difficulties that must still be overcome."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The rapid termination of war contracts, prompt clearance of unneeded Government-owned equipment from private plants, and other reconversion policies have greatly speeded up the beginning of peacetime work in reconverted plants."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Although the first great shock of demobilization and war-work termination has thus been met better than many observers expected, specific industries and specific regions show much unevenness in the progress of reconversion."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Quarterly Report of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion analyzes the difficulties in recruiting personnel and obtaining materials that hamper reconversion in certain industries and proposes policies to deal with these situations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The lack of adequate housing is one of the main factors checking the flow of workers into areas where job opportunities exist.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"FEDERAL REVENUE, BORROWING, AND THE PUBLIC DEBT I."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS AND TAX POLICY Recommendations for tax legislation should be considered not only in the light of the financial requirements of the ensuing year, but also in the light of future years financial requirements and a full consideration of economic conditions."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures are estimated at nearly 36 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947; they can hardly he expected to be reduced to less than 25 billion dollars in subsequent years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Net receipts in the fiscal year 1947 are estimated at 31.5 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Included in this estimate are 2 billion dollars of receipts from disposal and rental of surplus property and 190 million dollars of receipts from renegotiation of wartime contracts.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These sources of receipts will disappear in future years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Tax collections for the fiscal year 1947 also will not yet fully reflect the reduction in corporate tax liabilities provided in the Revenue Act of 1945.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If the extraordinary receipts from the disposal of surplus property and renegotiation of contracts be disregarded, and if the tax reductions adopted in the Revenue Act of 1945 were fully effective, present tax rates would yield about 27 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These estimates for the fiscal year 1947 are based on the assumption of generally favorable business conditions but not on an income reflecting full employment and the high productivity that we hope to achieve.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In future years the present tax system, in conjunction with a full employment level of national income, could be expected to yield more than 30 billion dollars, which is substantially above the anticipated peacetime level of expenditures."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In view of the still extraordinarily large expenditures in the coming year and continuing inflationary pressures, I am making no recommendation for tax reduction at this time."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We have already had a substantial reduction in taxes from wartime peaks.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Revenue Act of 1945 was a major tax-reduction measure.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It decreased the total tax load by more than one-sixth, an amount substantially in excess of the reductions proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to congressional tax committees in October 1945."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These proposed reductions were designed to encourage reconversion and peacetime business expansion.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The possibility of further tax reductions must depend on the budgetary situation and the economic situation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The level of anticipated expenditures for the fiscal year 1947 and the volume of outstanding public debt require the maintenance of large revenues.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Moreover, inflationary pressures still appear dangerously powerful, and ill-advised tax reduction would operate to strengthen them still further."
1946,Truman,Democratic,My decision not to recommend additional tax reductions at this time is made in the light of existing economic conditions and prospects.
1946,Truman,Democratic,BORROWING AND THE PUBLIC DEBT The successful conclusion of the Victory loan marked the end of war borrowing and the beginning of the transition to postwar debt management.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Because of the success of the Victory loan, I am happy to report that the Treasury will not need to borrow any new money from the public during the remainder of the present fiscal year except through regular sales of savings bonds and savings notes."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Furthermore, a part of the large cash balance now in the Treasury will be used for debt redemption so that the public debt which now amounts to about 278 billion dollars will decrease by several billion dollars during the next 18 months."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The present statutory debt limit of 300 billion dollars will provide an ample margin for all of the public-debt transactions through the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The net effect of the excess of expenditures and debt redemption on the Treasury cash balance, as compared with selected previous years, is shown in the following table: Although the public debt is expected to decline, a substantial volume of refinancing will be required, because of the large volume of maturing obligations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Redemptions of savings bonds also have been running high in recent months and are expected to remain large for some time.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The issuance of Savings bonds will be continued.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These bonds represent a convenient method of investment for small savers, and also an anti-inflationary method of refinancing."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Government agencies and trust funds are expected to buy about 2.5 billion dollars of Government securities during the next 6 months, and 2.8 billion dollars more during the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Through these and other debt operations, the distribution of the Federal debt among the various types of public and private owners will change, even though the total is expected to decline."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The interest policies followed in the refinancing operations will have a major impact not only on the provision for interest payments in future budgets, but also on the level of interest rates prevailing in private financing."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The average rate of interest on the debt is now a little under 2 percent.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Low interest rates will be an important force in promoting the full production and full employment in the postwar period for which we are all striving.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Close wartime cooperation between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve System has made it possible to finance the most expensive war in history at low and stable rates of interest.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This cooperation will continue.
1946,Truman,Democratic,No less important than the level of interest rates paid on the debt is the distribution of its ownership.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of the total debt, more than half represents direct savings of individuals or investments of funds received from individual Savings by life insurance companies, mutual Savings banks, Savings and loan associations, private or Government trust funds, and other agencies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Most of the remaining debt-more than 100 billion dollars--is held by the commercial banks and the Federal Reserve banks.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Heavy purchases by the banks were necessary to provide adequate funds to finance war expenditures.
1946,Truman,Democratic,A considerable portion of these obligations are short-term in character and hence will require refinancing in the coming months and years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Since they have been purchased out of newly created bank funds, continuance of the present low rates of interest is entirely appropriate."
1946,Truman,Democratic,To do otherwise would merely increase bank profits at the expense of the taxpayer.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The 275-billion-dollar debt poses a problem that requires careful consideration in the determination of financial and economic policies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have learned that the problem, serious as it is, can be managed."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Its management will require determined action to keep our Federal Budget in order and to relate our fiscal policies to the requirements of an expanding economy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The more successful we are in achieving full production and full employment the easier it will he to manage the debt and pay for the debt service.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Large though the debt is, it is within our economic capacity."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The interest charges on it amount to but a small proportion of our national income.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Government is determined, by a resolute policy of economic stabilization, to protect the interests of the millions of American citizens who have invested in its securities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the past 6 months the net revenue receipts of the Federal Government have been about 20 billion dollars, almost as much as during the closing 6 months of 1944 when the country was still engaged in all-out warfare."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The high level of these receipts reflects the smoothness of the reconversion and particularly the strength of consumer demand.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But the receipts so far collected, it must be remembered, do not reflect any of the tax reductions made by the Revenue Act of 1945."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These reductions will not have their full effect on the revenue collected until the fiscal year 1948.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is good to move toward a balanced budget and a start on the retirement of the debt at a time when demand for goods is strong and the business outlook is good.
1946,Truman,Democratic,These conditions prevail today.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Business is good and there are still powerful forces working in the direction of inflation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This is not the time for tax reduction.
1946,Truman,Democratic,RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC FEDERAL ACIVITIES I.WAR LIQUIDATION AND NATIONAL DEFENSE (a)War expenditures.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The fiscal year 1947 will see a continuance of war liquidation and occupation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,During this period we shall also lay the foundation for our peacetime system of national defense.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1945, almost wholly a period of global war-fare, war expenditures amounted to 90.5 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,For the fiscal year 1946.war expenditures were originally estimated at 70 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,That estimate was made a year ago while we were still engaged in global warfare.
1946,Truman,Democratic,After victory over Japan this estimate was revised to 50.5 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Further cut-backs and accelerated demobilization have made possible an additional reduction in the rate of war spending.
1946,Truman,Democratic,During the first 6 months 32.9 billion dollars were spent.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is now estimated that 16.1 billion dollars will be spent during the second 6 months, or a total of 49 billion dollars during the whole fiscal year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For the fiscal year 1947 it is estimated, tentatively, that expenditures for war liquidation, for occupation, and for national defense will be reduced to 15 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The War and Navy Departments are expected to spend 13 billion dollars; expenditures of other agencies, such as the United States Maritime Commission, the War Shipping Administration, and the Office of Price Administration, and payments to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are estimated at 3 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Allowing for estimated net receipts of 1 billion dollars arising from war activities of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the estimated total of war expenditures is 15 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,At this time Only a tentative break-down of the total estimate for war and defense activities can be indicated.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"An expenditure of 15 billion dollars for war liquidation, occupation, and national defense is a large sum for a year which begins 10 months after fighting has ended."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is 10 times our expenditures for defense before the war; it amounts to about 10 percent of our expected national income.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This estimate reflects the immense job that is involved in winding up a global war effort and stresses the great responsibility that victory has placed upon this country.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The large expenditures needed for our national defense emphasize the great scope for effective organization in furthering economy and efficiency.
1946,Truman,Democratic,To this end I have recently recommended to the Congress adoption of legislation combining the War and Navy Departments into a single Department of National Defense.
1946,Truman,Democratic,A large part of these expenditures is still to be attributed to the costs of the. war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Assuming, somewhat arbitrarily, that about one-half of the 15-billion-dollar outlay for the fiscal year 1947 is for war liquidation, aggregate expenditures by this Government for the second World War are now estimated at 347 billion dollars through June 30, 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of this, about 9 billion dollars will have been recovered through renegotiation and sale of surplus property by June 30, 1947; this has been reflected in the estimates of receipts."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Demobilization and strength of armed forces.--Demobilization of our armed forces is proceeding rapidly.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"At the time of victory in Europe, about 12.3 million men and women were in the armed forces; 7.6 million were overseas."
1946,Truman,Democratic,By the end of December 1945 our armed forces had been reduced to below 7 million.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"By June 30, 1946, they will number about 2.9 million, of whom 1.8 million will be individuals enlisted and inducted after VE-day."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Mustering-out pay is a large item of our war liquidation expense; it will total 2.5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946, and about 500 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In the fiscal year 1947 the strength of our armed forces will still be above the ultimate peacetime level.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As I have said, War and Navy Department requirements indicate a strength of about 2 million in the armed forces a year from now."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This is necessary to enable us to do our share in the occupation of enemy territories and in the preservation of peace in a troubled world.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenditures for pay, subsistence, travel, and miscellaneous expenses of the armed forces, excluding mustering-out pay, are estimated at 5 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Contract settlement and surplus property disposal.--The winding up of war procurement is the second most important liquidation job.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"By the end of November a total of 301,000 prime contracts involving commitments of 64 billion dollars had been terminated."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of this total, 67,000 contracts with commitments of 35 billion dollars remained to be settled."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Termination payments on these contracts are estimated at about 3.5 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is expected that more than half of these terminated contracts will be settled during the current fiscal year, leaving payments of about 1.5 billion dollars for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Another important aspect of war supply liquidation is the disposal of surplus property.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Munitions, ships, plants, installations, and supplies, originally costing 50 billion dollars or more, will ultimately be declared surplus."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The sale value of this property will be far less than original cost and disposal expenses are estimated at 10 to 15 cents on each dollar realized.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Disposal units within existing agencies have been organized to liquidate surplus property under the direction of the Surplus Property Administration.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Overseas disposal activities have been centralized in the State Department to permit this program to he carried on in line with over-all foreign policy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Thus far only about 13 billion dollars of the ultimate surplus, including 5 billion dollars of unsalable aircraft, has been declared."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of this amount, 2.3 billion dollars have been disposed of, in sales yielding 600 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The tremendous job of handling surplus stocks will continue to affect Federal expenditures and receipts for several years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The speed and effectiveness of surplus disposal operations will be of great importance for the domestic economy as well as for foreign economic policies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"War supplies, maintenance, and relief.--Adequate provision for the national defense requires that we keep abreast of scientific and technical advances."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The tentative estimates for the fiscal year 1947 make allowance for military research, limited procurement of weapons in the developmental state, and some regular procurement of munitions which were developed but not mass-produced when the war ended."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenditures for procurement and construction will constitute one-third or less of total defense outlays, compared to a ratio of two-thirds during the war years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The estimates also provide for the maintenance of our war-expanded naval and merchant fleets, military installations, and stocks of military equipment and supplies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our naval combatant fleet is three times its pre-Pearl Harbor tonnage.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our Merchant Marine is five times its prewar size.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The War Department has billions of dollars worth of equipment and supplies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Considerable maintenance and repair expense is necessary for the equipment which we desire to retain in active status or in war reserve.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenses will be incurred for winnowing the stocks of surpluses, for preparing lay-up facilities for the reserve fleets, and for storage of reserve equipment and supplies."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Military expenditures in the current fiscal year include 650 million dollars for civilian supplies for the prevention of starvation and disease in occupied areas.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures on this account will continue in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The war expenditures also cover the expenses of civilian administration in occupied areas.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war, 15 cents of each dollar of our war expenditures was for lend-lease aid."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"With lend-lease terminated, I expect the direct operations under this program to be substantially completed in the current fiscal year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The expenditures estimated for the fiscal year 1947 under this program are mainly inter-agency reimbursements for past transactions.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Relief and rehabilitation expenditures are increasing.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is imperative that we give all necessary aid within our means to the people who have borne the ravages of war.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I estimate that in the fiscal year 1946 expenditures for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will total 1.3 billion dollars and in the following year 1.2 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Insofar as possible, procurement for this purpose will be from war surpluses. (b)Authorizations for war and national defense."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war, authorizations and appropriations had to be enacted well in advance of obligation and spending to afford ample time for planning of production by the procurement services and by industry."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Thus our cumulative war program authorized in the period between July 1, 1940, and July I, 1945, was 431 billion dollars, including net war commitments of Government corporations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures against those authorizations totaled 290 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This left 141 billion dollars in unobligated authorizations and unliquidated obligations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"With the end of fighting, it became necessary to adjust war authorizations to the requirements of war liquidation and continuing national defense."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Intensive review of the war authorizations by both the executive and the legislative branches has been continued since VJ-day.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As a result, the authorized war program is being brought more nearly into line with expenditures."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Rescissions and authorizations through the fiscal year 1946.--Readjusting the war program, as the Congress well knows, is not an easy task."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Authorizations must not be too tight, lest we hamper necessary operations; they must not be too ample, lest we lose control of spending."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Last September, I transmitted to the Congress recommendations on the basis of which the Congress voted H.R. 4407 to repeal 50.3 billion dollars of appropriations and authorizations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I found it necessary to veto this bill because it was used as a vehicle for legislation that would impair the reemployment program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"However, in order to preserve the fine work of the Congress on the rescissions, I asked the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to place the exact amounts indicated for repeal in a nonexpendable reserve, and to advise the departments and agencies accordingly."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This has been done.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In accord with Public Law 132 of the Seventy-ninth Congress, I have transmitted recommendations for additional rescissions for the current fiscal year of appropriations amounting to 5.8 billion dollars and of contract authorizations totaling 420 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The net reduction in authority to obligate will be 5.0 billion dollars, because, of the appropriations, 1.2 billion dollars will have to be restored in subsequent years to liquidate contract authorizations still on the books."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The appropriations recommended for repeal include 2,827 million dollars for the Navy Department, 1,421 million dollars for the War Department, 850 million dollars for lend-lease, 384 million dollars for the War Shipping Administration, and 260 million dollars for the United States Maritime Commission."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The contract authorizations proposed for repeal are for the Maritime Commission.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, there are unused tonnage authorizations for construction of naval vessels now valued at 5.4 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In September 1945, I suggested that this authority be reviewed by the appropriate committees of the Congress, and the Congress has moved to bar construction under these authorizations during the remainder of the fiscal year 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I propose to continue this prohibition in the Navy budget estimates for the fiscal year 1947 and now renew my recommendation that legislation be enacted at the earliest time to clear the statute books of these authorizations.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The amounts indicated for repeal in H.R. 4407 and the further rescissions which I have recommended, excluding duplications and deferred cash payments on existing authorizations, represent a cut in the authorized war program of 60.8 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The war authorizations will also be reduced 3.7 billion dollars by carrying receipts of revolving accounts to surplus, by lapses, and by cancellation and repayment of commitments of the Government war corporations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the other hand, supplemental appropriations of 600 million dollars will be required for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the net, it is estimated that the cumulative authorized war and national defense program will amount to 368 billion dollars on June 30, 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures of 49 billion dollars during the fiscal year 1946 will have pushed cumulative expenditures to 339 billion dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The unexpended balances will be down to 28 billion dollars on June 30,1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"New authorizations for national defense and war liquidation in the fiscal year 1947. --The expenditures of 15 billion dollars for national defense and war liquidation in the fiscal year 1947 will be partly for payment of contractual obligations incurred in the past, and partly for the payment of new obligations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The unexpended balances on June 30, 1946, will be scattered among hundreds of separate appropriations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Thus, while some appropriation accounts will have unused balances, others will require additional appropriations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is estimated that authorizations to incur new obligations of 11,772 million dollars will be needed during the fiscal year '947, mainly for the War and Navy Departments."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of the required authorizations, 11,365 million dollars will be in new appropriations, 400 million dollars in new contract authority, and 7 million dollars in reappropriations of unobligated balances."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, appropriations of 825 million dollars will be needed to liquidate obligations under existing contract authorizations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Taking into account the tentative authorizations and expenditures estimated for the fiscal year 1947, and offsets of 3 billion dollars in war commitments of Government corporations, the cumulative authorized war and national defense program on June 30, 1947, will be 376 billion dollars; total expenditures, 354 billion dollars; and unexpended balances, 22 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The 22 billion dollars of unexpended balances tentatively indicated as of June 30, 1947, comprise both unobligated authorizations and unliquidated obligations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Most of the unliquidated obligations result from transactions booked during the war years.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A large part of the 22 billion dollars would never be spent even if not repealed, for the appropriations will lapse in due course."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For example, several billion dollars of these unliquidated obligations represent unsettled inter- and intra-departmental agency accounts for war procurement."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Legislation is being requested to facilitate the adjustment of some of these inter-agency accounts.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Another 6 billion dollars is set aside for contract termination payments.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"If contract settlement costs continue in line with recent experience, it is likely that part of the 6 billion dollars will remain unspent."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On the other hand, some of the 22 billion dollars would be available for obligation and expenditure unless impounded."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In certain appropriations, such as those for longcycle procurement, considerable carryover of unliquidated obligations into future years is to be expected and is necessary."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"However, substantial further rescissions can and should he made when the war liquidation program tapers off and budgetary requirements for national defense are clarified."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As I have said, I shall continue to review the war authorizations and from time to time recommend excess balances for repeal."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"As in recent years, detailed recommendations concerning most appropriations for the national defense program are postponed until the spring."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In connection with the war activities of the United States Maritime Commission and certain other agencies, however, I now make specific recommendations for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"No additional authorizations or appropriations will be necessary for the Maritime Commission since sufficient balances will he left after the above mentioned rescissions to carry out the program now contemplated for the fiscal year 1947. 2.AFTERMATH OF WAR Nearly one-third--11 billion dollars --of estimated Federal expenditures in the fiscal year 1947 will be for purposes that are largely inherited from the war-payments to veterans, interest on the Federal debt, and refunds of taxes. (a)For veterans. ""Veterans' pensions and benefits"" has become one of the largest single categories in the Federal Budget."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I am recommending for this purpose total appropriations of 4,787 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenditures in the fiscal year are estimated, under present legislation, at 4,208 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These expenditures will help our veterans through their readjustment period and provide lasting care for those who were disabled.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has provided unemployment allowances for veterans during their readjustment period.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditure of 850 million dollars for this purpose is anticipated for the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, readjustment allowances for self-employed veterans are expected to cost 340 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On May 28, 1945, in asking the Congress to raise the ceiling on benefits for civilian unemployed to not less than 25 dollars a week during the immediate reconversion period, I suggested that the Congress also consider liberalizing veterans' allowances."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Elsewhere in this Message I reiterate my recommendation with respect to emergency unemployment compensation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I also recommend increasing veterans' unemployment allowances from 20 dollars to 25 dollars a week.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This would involve additional expenditures estimated at approximately 220 million dollars for the fiscal year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Included in the 1947 Budget is an expenditure of 535 million dollars for veterans' education under provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This amount includes both tuition expenses and maintenance allowances.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is expected that half a million veterans will be enrolled in our schools and colleges during the year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The ultimate benefit which veterans receive from the loan guarantee provisions of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act depends largely on the success of our stabilization program in restraining building costs and real estate values.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Under the revised procedure contained in recent amendments, the administrative workload will be minimized by the almost complete transfer of authority for approving the guarantees to private lending agencies and private appraisers designated by the Veterans Administration."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This authority carries with it the responsibility for restricting the guarantees to loans on reasonably valued properties.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Costs of the program, other than for administration, are estimated at 21 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Pensions for veterans will require expenditures estimated at 1,748 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Two-thirds of this amount will be received by veterans of the war which we have just won.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This figure includes 55 million dollars of increased pensions for student-veterans in our vocational rehabilitation program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, 170 million dollars will he expended in transfers to the National Service Life Insurance Fund from general and special accounts."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures under the appropriation for salaries and expenses of the Veterans Administration are estimated at 528 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This includes 260 million dollars for medical care and the operation of some 103,000 hospital and domiciliary beds."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A separate appropriation for hospital and domiciliary facilities, additional to the total for veterans' pensions and benefits, covers construction that will provide some 13,000 hospital beds as part of the 500-million dollar hospital construction program already authorized by the Congress."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The estimated expenditures of 130 million dollars for this purpose are classified in the Budget as part of the general public works program for the next fiscal year. (b)For interest.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Interest payments on the public debt are estimated at 5 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947, an increase of 250 million dollars from the revised estimate for the current fiscal year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This increase reflects chiefly payment of interest on additions to the debt this year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Assuming continuance of present interest rates, the Government's interest bill is now reaching the probable postwar level. (c)For refunds."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"An estimated total of 1,585 million dollars of refunds will he paid to individuals and corporations during the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Slightly over half of this amount, or 80 million dollars, will be accessory to the simplified pay-as-you-go method of tax collection, and will be the result of overwithholding and overdeclaration of expected income."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Most of the remainder will arise from loss and excess-profits credit carrybacks, recomputed amortization on war plants, and special relief from the excess profits tax."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This category of expenditures is thus losing gradually its ""aftermath-of-war"" character, and by the succeeding year will reflect almost entirely the normal operation of loss carry-backs and current tax collection. 3.AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS The agricultural programs contemplated for the fiscal year 1947 are those which are essential for the provision of an adequate supply of food and other agricultural commodities with a fair return to American farmers."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To support these objectives, expenditures by the Department of Agriculture estimated at 784 million dollars from general and special accounts will be required in the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This compares with estimated expenditures of 676 million dollars in 1946.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These figures exclude expenditures by the Department of Agriculture on account of lend-lease, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and other war expenditures."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The expenditure for the fiscal year 1947 is composed of 553 million dollars for ""aids to agriculture,"" 35 million dollars for general public works, and 196 million dollars for other services of the Department."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Net outlays for the price stabilization, price support, and other programs of the Commodity Credit Corporation are expected to increase from about 750 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to about 1,500 million dollars in 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Cash advances made on loans by the Farm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration are expected to amount to 266 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 351 million dollars in 1947; and after receipts from principal and interest are taken into account, net loan expenditures of these two agencies will amount to 120 and 209 million dollars in the two fiscal years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"To provide for the expenditures from general and special accounts, I recommend for the fiscal year 1947 appropriations of 721 million dollars (including the existing permanent appropriation of an amount equal to 30 percent of estimated annual customs receipts) and a reappropriation of 88 million dollars of prior-year balances from customs receipts."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In addition there is a recommended authorization of 367.5 million dollars for borrowing from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for the loan programs of the Farm Security Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is expected that the operations of the Commodity Credit Corporation will be financed during the coming year through the 500 million dollars of lend-lease funds which the Congress has earmarked for price support purposes, a supplemental appropriation to restore impaired capital of the Corporation, and the borrowing authority of the Corporation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Some detailed recommendations follow for major agricultural programs.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Conservation and use of land.--I am recommending that 270 million dollars be appropriated for ""conservation and use of agricultural land resources""- the so-called AAA program-for the fiscal year 1947, compared with 356 million dollars in the current year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This reduction of 86 million dollars is in large part accounted for by elimination of the wartime flax production incentive project and other nonrecurring items; the proposed reduction in normal activities is less than 33 million dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For the past several years, this program has consisted largely of payments to farmers for application of fertilizer and other approved soil management practices."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I am convinced that farmers generally are now fully alert to the benefits, both immediate and long-term, which they derive from the practices encouraged by this program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I believe, therefore, that this subsidization should continue to be reduced."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Rural electrification.-- It is proposed that the loan authorization for the Rural Electrification Administration for the fiscal year 1947 he increased from 200 million dollars to 250 million dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"During the war period, REA was limited by the scarcity of materials and manpower."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But that situation is rapidly changing, and the REA program, which was materially stepped up for the fiscal year 1946, can he increased still more."
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is my belief that a feasible and practical rural electrification program should be carried forward as rapidly as possible.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This will involve total loans of approximately 1,800 million dollars over the next 10 years, much of which will be repaid during that period."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Other programs.--It is recommended that the continuing forest land-acquisition program be resumed at the rate of 3 million dollars annually, which is about the minimum rate at which this program can be economically carried on."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The lands involved in this program can contribute fully to the national welfare only when brought into the national forest system for protection and development.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Such programs as those of the Farm Security Administration and the Farm Credit Administration are estimated to be continued during the fiscal year 1947 at about the same level as in the fiscal year 1946.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Recent action by the Congress has permitted some expansion of the school-lunch program.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I hope it will be continued and expanded.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The budgets of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation will be transmitted in the spring under the terms of the Government Corporation Control Act. 4.
1946,Truman,Democratic,TRANSPORTATION Transportation is one of the major fields for both public and private investment.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Our facilities for transportation and communication must be constantly improved to serve better the convenience of the public and to facilitate the sound growth and development of the whole economy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Federal capital outlays for transportation facilities are expected to approximate 519 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,State and local governments may spend 400 million dollars.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Private investment, over half of it by railways, may approach 1,150 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Congress has already taken steps for the resumption of work on improvement of rivers and harbors and on the construction of new Federal-aid highways.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Much needed work on airports can begin when the Congress enacts legislation now in conference between the two Houses.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Federal expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 1947 include 53 million dollars for new construction in rivers, harbors, and the Panama Canal and 291 million dollars for highways and grade-crossing elimination, assuming that the States expend some 275 million dollars on the Federal-aid system."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Additional expenditures for highways totaling 36 million dollars are anticipated by the Forest Service, National Park Service, and the Territory of Alaska."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Civil airways and airports will involve expenditures of 35 million dollars under existing authority.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Additional Federal expenditures exceeding 20 million dollars (to be matched by States and municipalities) may be made during the fiscal year 1947 under the airport legislation now in conference between the two Houses of the Congress.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The United States now controls almost two-thirds of the world's merchant shipping, most of it Government-owned, compared with little more than one-seventh of the world's tonnage in 1939."
1946,Truman,Democratic,This places a heavy responsibility upon the Nation to provide for speedy and efficient world commerce as a contribution to general economic recovery.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The estimates for the United States Maritime Commission and War Shipping Administration provide for the transition of shipping operation from a war to a peace basis; the sale, chartering, or lay-up of much of the war-built fleet; and for a program of ship construction of some 84 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 to round out the merchant fleet for peacetime use."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Federal aids, subsidies, and regulatory controls for transportation should follow the general principle of benefiting the national economy as a whole."
1946,Truman,Democratic,They should seek to improve the transportation system and increase its efficiency with resulting lower rates and superior service.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Differential treatment which benefits one type of transportation to the detriment of another should be avoided save when it is demonstrated clearly to be in the public interest. 5.RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT Total capital outlays for resource development are estimated at 653 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947 as compared with 452 million dollars in 1946.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These include capital expenditures by the Rural Electrification Administration and expenditures for resource development by other organizational units in the Department of Agriculture which are also mentioned above under ""agricultural programs."" The reclamation and flood control projects which I am recommending for the fiscal year 1947 will involve capital outlays of approximately 319 million dollars as compared with 245 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These expenditures cover programs of the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, and the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A number of these projects are multiple-purpose projects, providing not only for reclamation and irrigation of barren land and flood control, but also for the production of power needed for industrial development of the areas."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures for power transmission and distribution facilities by the Bonneville Power Administration are expected to increase from 12 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 15 million dollars in the next fiscal year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, the Southwestern Power Administration will undertake a new program involving expenditures of about 16 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Rural Electrification Administration will require expenditures during the current fiscal year estimated at 156 million dollars; in the fiscal year 1947, at 241 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The TVA program includes completion of major multiple-purpose projects-navigation, flood control, and power facilities--and additions to chemical plants and related facilities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures for these capital improvement programs are estimated at 30 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 39 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenditures for construction of roads and other developmental works in the national forests, parks, and other public lands, and for capital outlays for fish and wildlife development will increase from below 9 million dollars in the fiscal year 1946 to 24 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. 6."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"SOCIAL SECURITY AND HEALTH Benefit payments out of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund during 1947 are estimated at 407 million dollars, while withdrawals by the States from the Unemployment Trust Fund for compensation payments are expected to total 1 billion dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These disbursements are financed out of Social Security contributions.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The appropriations from general and special accounts for the social security program, which cover Federal administrative expenses and grants to States for assistance programs, are estimated at 593 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947, an increase of 57 million dollars over the current year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The increase anticipates greater administrative workload and higher grants to match increasing State payments.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The social security program does not include all the Federal health services under existing legislation.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For the other health services classified under general government and national defense, appropriations are estimated at 102 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Some expansion in peacetime medical research and other programs of the Public Health Service is provided for in the appropriation estimates for these purposes totaling approximately 87 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947 which are submitted under provisions of existing law.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Part of this will be provided through the social security appropriations, the remainder through other appropriations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"About 28 million dollars is recommended for maternity care and health services for children under existing law, mainly under the emergency provision for the wives and infants of servicemen."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"While we should avoid duplication of maternity and child health services which will be provided through the proposed general system of prepaid medical care, legislation is needed to supplement such services."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For medical education, I have recommended legislation authorizing grants-in-aid to public and nonprofit institutions."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The existing sources of support for medical schools require supplementation to sustain the expansion that is needed.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Hospitals, sanitation works, and additional facilities at medical schools will be required for an adequate national health program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Legislation is now pending in the Congress to authorize grants for the construction of hospitals and health centers and grants and loans for water-pollution control.
1946,Truman,Democratic,I hope the Congress will act favorably on generous authorizing legislation. 7.RESEARCH AND EDUCATION The Budget provides for continuation and desirable expansion of the research activities that are carried on throughout the Federal establishment and through previously authorized grants to the States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Additional appropriations will he required for the proposed central Federal research agency which I recommended last September 6.
1946,Truman,Democratic,That agency will coordinate existing research activities and administer funds for new research activities wherever they are needed; it will not itself conduct research.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The plan contemplates expenditures through the new research agency of approximately 40 million dollars for the first year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These amounts are small in relation to the important contribution they can make to the national income, the welfare of our people, and the common defense."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures must be limited for the time being by the capacity of research agencies to make wise use of funds.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The maintenance of our position as a nation, however, will require more emphasis on research expenditures in the future than in the past."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Educational expenditures will require a significant share of the national income in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"State, local, and private expenditures for the current support of elementary, secondary, and higher education are expected to be substantially above 3 billion dollars in that year."
1946,Truman,Democratic,These non-Federal expenditures will be supplemented by Federal expenditures estimated at 625 million dollars in the present Budget.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of this amount, the estimate for veterans' education, as previously mentioned, is 535 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Other amounts include 21 million dollars for the support of vocational education in public schools, 5 million dollars for the land-grant colleges, 50 million dollars for the present school lunch and milk program, 1 million dollars for the Office of Education, and approximately 13 million dollars for various other items."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In view of the major policy issues which are still under study by the Congress and the Administration, no specific amount has been determined for the Federal grants, previously recommended in this Message, which would assist the States generally in assuring more nearly equal opportunities for a good education."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Notwithstanding the urgent need for additional school and college buildings, careful planning will be required for the expenditures to be made under the proposed legislation to aid the States in providing educational facilities."
1946,Truman,Democratic,A major share of the grants for the first year would he for surveys and plans. 8.INTERNATIONAL-FINANCIAL PROGRAMS I have already outlined the broad objectives of our foreign economic policy.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In the present section I shall indicate the Federal outlays which the execution of these programs may require in the fiscal years 1946 and 1947. (a)On the termination of lend-lease, the lend-lease countries were required to pay for goods in the lend-lease pipe line either in cash or by borrowing from the United States or by supplying goods and services to the United States."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Credits for this purpose have already been extended to the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium amounting to 675 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The settlement credit of 650 million dollars to the United Kingdom includes an amount preliminarily fixed at 118 million dollars which represents the excess of purchases by the United Kingdom from the pipe line over goods and services supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States since VJ-day and the balance of various claims by one government against the other.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Credits are also being negotiated with lend-lease countries to finance the disposition of lend-lease inventories and installations and property declared to be surplus.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"For instance, 532 million dollars of the settlement credit to the United Kingdom is for this purpose."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"These credits will involve no new expenditures by this Government, since they merely provide for deferred repayment by other governments for goods and services which have been financed from war appropriations. (b)Expenditures from the appropriations to United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which were discussed under war expenditures above, are estimated to be 1.3 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1946 and 1.2 billion dollars in the fiscal year 1947. (c)To assist other countries in the restoration of their economies the Export-Import Bank has already negotiated loans in the fiscal year 1946 amounting in total to about 1,010 million dollars and an additional 195 million dollars will probably be committed shortly."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The Bank is also granting loans to carry out its original purpose of directly expanding the foreign trade of the United States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,In this connection the Bank has established a fund of too million dollars to finance the export of cotton from the United States.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The Export-Import Bank has thus loaned or committed approximately 1,300 million dollars during the current fiscal year and it is expected that demands on its resources will increase in the last 6 months of the fiscal year 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Requests for loans are constantly being received by the Bank from countries desiring to secure goods and services in this country for the reconstruction or development of their economies.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"On July 31, 1945, the lending authority of the Export-Import Bank was increased to a total of 3,500 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I anticipate that during the period covered by this.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Budget the Bank will reach this limit.
1946,Truman,Democratic,The bulk of the expenditures from the loans already granted will fall in the fiscal year 1946 while the bulk of the expenditures from loans yet to be negotiated will fall in the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"In view of the urgent need for the Bank's credit, I may find it necessary to request a further increase in its lending authority at a later date. (d)The proposed line of credit of 3,750 million dollars to the United Kingdom will be available up to the end of 1951 and will be used to assist the United Kingdom in financing the deficit in its balance of payments during the transition period."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The rate at which the United Kingdom will draw on the credit will depend on the rapidity with which it can reconvert its economy and adapt its trade to the postwar world.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The anticipated rate of expenditure is likely to be heaviest during the next 2 years. (e)Since the Bretton Woods Agreements have now been approved by the required number of countries, both the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will commence operations during 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The organization of these institutions will undoubtedly take some time, and it is unlikely that their operations will reach any appreciable scale before the beginning of the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of the 2,750 million dollars required for the Fund, t,Soo million dollars will be provided in cash or notes from the exchange stabilization fund established under the Gold Reserve Act of '934."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The remaining 950 million dollars will be paid initially in the form of non-interest-bearing notes issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is not anticipated that the Fund will require in cash any of the 950 million dollars during the fiscal years 1946 and 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Consequently, no cash withdrawals from the Treasury will be required in connection with the Fund in these years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The subscription to the Bank amounts to 3,175 million dollars."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Of this total, 2 percent must be paid immediately and the Bank is required to call a further 8 percent of the subscription during its first year of operations."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The balance of the subscription is payable when required by the Bank either for direct lending or to make good its guarantees.
1946,Truman,Democratic,It is likely that the United States will be required to pay little if any more than the initial 10 percent before the end of the fiscal year 1947.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"I anticipate that net expenditures of the Export-Import Bank and expenditures arising from the British credit and the Bretton Woods Agreements will amount to 2,614 million dollars, including the noncash item of 950 million dollars for the Fund, in the fiscal year 1946, and 2,754 million dollars in the fiscal year 1947. 9.GENERAL GOVERNMENT The responsibilities of the Government, in both domestic and international affairs, have increased greatly in the past decade."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Consequently, the Government is larger than it was before the war, and its general operating costs are higher."
1946,Truman,Democratic,We cannot shrink the Government to prewar dimensions unless we slough off these new responsibilities--and we cannot do that without paying an excessive price in terms of our national welfare.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We can, however, enhance its operating efficiency through improved organization."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I expect to make such improvements under the authority of the Reorganization Act of 1945.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The appropriations which I am recommending for general government for the fiscal year 1947 are 1,604 million dollars under existing legislation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"This is an increase of 458 million dollars over the total of enacted appropriations for the current fiscal year, but a substantial part of this increase is due to the fact that the appropriations for the fiscal year 1946 were made prior to the general increase of employees' salaries last July 1, for which allowance is made in the anticipated supplemental appropriations for 1946."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The recommended total for 1947 for general government, like the estimates for national defense and other specific programs, does not allow for the further salary increases for Government employees which, I hope, will be authorized by pending legislation, but the tentative lump-sum estimates under proposed legislation contemplate that such salary increases will be effective almost at once."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures for general government in the fiscal year 1947 are expected to continue the slowly rising trend which began in 1943.
1946,Truman,Democratic,This category includes a great variety of items-not merely the overhead costs of the Government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It includes all the expenditures of the Cabinet departments, other than for national defense, aids to agriculture, general public works, and the social security program."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It includes also expenditures of the legislative branch, the Judiciary; and many of the independent agencies of the executive branch."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Consequently, the estimated increase in 1947 in the total of general government expenditures reflects a variety of influences."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Now included in general government are certain activities formerly classified under national defense.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Some of these, such as certain functions of the former Foreign Economic Administration and the War Manpower Commission, are still needed during the period of reconversion; others are in the process of liquidation."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"A few wartime activities, for example, the international information and foreign intelligence services and some of the wartime programs for controlling disease and crime, have become part of our regular government establishment."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures for these former wartime functions explain about 40 percent of the increase in expenditures for general government.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Other increases are for civil aeronautics promotion, the business and manufacturing censuses, and other expanded business services of the Department of Commerce which have been referred to above; the Forest and Soil Conservation Services and other activities of the Department of Agriculture; certain conservation activities of the Department of the Interior; and the collection of internal revenue in the Treasury Department."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The necessity for reestablishing postal services curtailed during the war and advances in the rates of pay for postal employees have increased substantially the estimated expenditures for postal service for both the current and the next fiscal year.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It is not expected that this increase will cause expenditures to exceed postal revenues in either year, although an excess of expenditures may occur in the fiscal year 1947 if salaries are increased further."
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Expenditures for our share of the administrative budgets of the United Nations and other permanent international bodes will increase sharply in the fiscal year 1947, yet will remain a small part of our total Budget."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The budget for the United Nations has not yet been determined; an estimate for our contribution will be submitted later.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Our contributions to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Labor Office, the Pan American Union, and other similar international agencies will aggregate about 3 million dollars for the fiscal year 1947."
1946,Truman,Democratic,The administrative expenses of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank will be met from their general funds.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"We have won a great war- we, the nations of plain people who hate war."
1946,Truman,Democratic,In the test of that war we found a strength of unity that brought us through - a strength that crushed the power of those who sought by force to deny our faith in the dignity of man.
1946,Truman,Democratic,During this trial the voices of disunity among us were silent or were subdued to an occasional whine that warned us that they were still among us.
1946,Truman,Democratic,Those voices are beginning to cry aloud again.
1946,Truman,Democratic,We must learn constantly to turn deaf ears to them.
1946,Truman,Democratic,They are voices which foster fear and suspicion and intolerance and hate.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"Thy seek to destroy our harmony, our understanding of each other, our American tradition of ""live and let live."" They have become busy again, trying to set race against race, creed against creed, farmer against city dweller, worker against employer, people against their own governments."
1946,Truman,Democratic,They seek only to do us mischief.
1946,Truman,Democratic,They must not prevail.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"It should be impossible for any man to contemplate without a sense of personal humility the tremendous events of the 12 months since the last annual Message, the great tasks that confront us, the new and huge problems of the coming months and years."
1946,Truman,Democratic,Yet these very things justify the deepest confidence in the future of this Nation of free men and women.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"The plain people of this country found the courage and the strength, the self-discipline, and the mutual respect to fight and to win, with the help of our allies, under God."
1946,Truman,Democratic,I doubt if the tasks of the future are more difficult.
1946,Truman,Democratic,"But if they are, then I say that our strength and our knowledge and our understanding will be equal to those tasks."
1947,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"TRUMAN'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 6, 1947 Mr."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States: It looks like a good many of you have moved over to the left since I was here last."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I come before you today to report on the State of the Union and, in the words of the Constitution, to recommend such measures as I judge necessary and expedient."
1947,Truman,Democratic,I come also to welcome you as you take up your duties and to discuss with you the manner in which you and I should fulfill our obligations to the American people during the next 2 years.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The power to mold the future of this Nation lies in our hands-yours and mine, and they are joined together by the Constitution."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"If in this year, and in the next, we can find the right course to take as each issue arises, and if, in spite of all difficulties, we have the courage and the resolution to take that course, then we shall achieve a state of well-being for our people without precedent in history."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"And if we continue to work with the other nations of the world earnestly, patiently, and wisely, we can-granting a will for peace on the part of our neighbors make a lasting peace for the world."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"But, if we are to realize these ends, the Congress and the President, during the next 2 years, must work together."
1947,Truman,Democratic,It is not unusual in our history that the majority of the Congress represents a party in opposition to the President's party.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I am the twentieth President of the United States who, at some time during his term of office, has found his own party to be in the minority in one or both Houses of Congress."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The first one was George Washington.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Wilson was number eighteen, and Hoover was number nineteen."
1947,Truman,Democratic,I realize that on some matters the Congress and the President may have honest differences of opinion.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Partisan differences, however, did not cause material disagreements as to the conduct of the war."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Nor, in the conduct of our international relations, during and since the war, have such partisan differences been material."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"On some domestic issues we may, and probably shall, disagree."
1947,Truman,Democratic,That in itself is not to be feared.
1947,Truman,Democratic,It is inherent in our form of Government.
1947,Truman,Democratic,But there are ways of disagreeing; men who differ can still work together sincerely for the common good.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We shall be risking the Nation's safety and destroying our opportunities for progress if we do not sett]e any disagreements in this spirit, without thought of partisan advantage."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"As the year 1947 begins, the state of our national economy presents great opportunities for all."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We have virtually full employment, our national production of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year prior to the war emergency."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The national income in 1946 was higher than in any peace-time year.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Our food production is greater than it has ever been.
1947,Truman,Democratic,During the last 5 years our productive facilities have been expanded in almost every field.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The American standard of living is higher now than ever before, and when the housing shortage can be overcome it will be even higher."
1947,Truman,Democratic,During the past few months we have removed at a rapid rate the emergency controls that the Federal Government had to exercise during the war.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The remaining controls will be retained only as long as they are needed to protect the public.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Private enterprise must be given the greatest possible freedom to continue the expansion of our economy.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In my proclamation of December 31, 1946, I announced the termination of hostilities."
1947,Truman,Democratic,This automatically ended certain temporary legislation and certain executive powers.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Two groups of temporary laws still remain: the first are those which by Congressional mandate are to last during the ""emergency""; the second are those which are to continue until the ""termination of the war."" I shall submit to the Congress recommendations for the repeal of certain of the statutes which by their terms continue for the duration of the ""emergency."" I shall at the same time recommend that others within this classification be extended until the state of war has been ended by treaty or by legislative action."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"As to those statutes which continue until the State of war has been terminated, I urge that the Congress promptly consider each statute individually, and repeal such emergency legislation where it is advisable."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Now that nearly all wartime controls have been removed, the operation of our industrial system depends to a greater extent on the decisions of businessmen, farmers, and workers."
1947,Truman,Democratic,These decisions must be wisely made with genuine concern for public welfare.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The welfare of businessmen, farmers, and workers depends upon the economic well-being of those who buy their products."
1947,Truman,Democratic,An important present source of danger to our economy is the possibility that prices might be raised to such an extent that the consuming public could not purchase the tremendous volume of goods and services which will be produced during 1947.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We all know that recent price increases have denied to many of our workers much of the value of recent wage increases.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Farmers have found that a large part of their increased income has been absorbed by increased prices.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"While some of our people have received raises in income which exceed price increases, the great majority have not."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Those persons who live on modest fixed incomes-retired persons living on pensions, for example-and workers whose incomes are relatively inflexible, such as teachers and other civil servants-have suffered hardship."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In the effort to bring about a sound and equitable price structure, each group of our population has its own responsibilities."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"It is up to industry not only to hold the line on existing prices, but to make reductions whenever profits justify such action."
1947,Truman,Democratic,It is up to labor to refrain from pressing for unjustified wage increases that will force increases in the price level.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"And it is up to Government to do everything in its power to encourage high- volume production, for that is what makes possible good wages, low prices, and reasonable profits."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In a few days there will be submitted to the Congress the Economic Report of the President, and also the Budget Message."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Those messages will contain many recommendations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Today I shall outline five major economic policies which I believe the Government should pursue during 1947.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"These policies are designed to meet our immediate needs and, at the same time, to provide for the long-range welfare of our free enterprise system: First, the promotion of greater harmony between labor and management."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Second, restriction of monopoly and unfair business practices; assistance to small business; and the promotion of the free competitive system of private enterprise."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Third, continuation of an aggressive program of home construction."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Fourth, the balancing of the budget in the next fiscal year and the achieving of a substantial surplus to be applied to the reduction of the public debt, Fifth, protection of a fair level of return to farmers in post-war agriculture."
1947,Truman,Democratic,LABOR AND MANAGEMENT The year just past-like the year after the First World War-was marred by labor management strife.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Despite this outbreak of economic warfare in 1946, we are today producing goods and services in record volume."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Nevertheless, it is essential to improve the methods for reaching agreement between labor and management and to reduce the number of strikes and lockouts."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We must not, however, adopt punitive legislation."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We must not, in order to punish a few labor leaders, pass vindictive laws which will restrict the proper rights of the rank and file of labor."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We must not, under the stress of emotion, endanger our American freedoms by taking ill-considered action which will lead to results not anticipated or desired."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We must remember, in reviewing the record of disputes in 1946, that management shares with labor the responsibility for failure to reach agreements which would have averted strikes."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"For that reason, we must realize that industrial peace cannot be achieved merely by laws directed against labor unions."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"During the last decade and a half, we have established a national labor policy in this country based upon free collective bargaining as the process for determining wages and working conditions."
1947,Truman,Democratic,That is still the national policy.
1947,Truman,Democratic,And it should continue to be the national policy.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"But as yet, not all of us have learned what it means to bargain freely and fairly."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Nor have all of us learned to carry the mutual responsibilities that accompany the right to bargain.
1947,Truman,Democratic,There have been abuses and harmful practices which limit the effectiveness of our system of collective bargaining.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Furthermore, we have lacked sufficient governmental machinery to aid labor and management in resolving their differences."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Certain labor-management problems need attention at once and certain others, by reason of their complexity, need exhaustive investigation. and study."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We should enact legislation to correct certain abuses and to provide additional governmental assistance in bargaining.
1947,Truman,Democratic,But we should also concern ourselves with the basic causes of labor-management difficulties.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In the light of these considerations, I propose to you and urge your cooperation in effecting the following four-point program to reduce industrial strife: Point number one is the early enactment of legislation to prevent certain unjustifiable practices."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"First, under this point, are jurisdictional strikes."
1947,Truman,Democratic,In such strikes the public and the employer are innocent bystanders who are injured by a collision between rival unions.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"This type of dispute hurts production, industry, and the public-and labor itself."
1947,Truman,Democratic,I consider jurisdictional strikes indefensible.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The National Labor Relations Act provides procedures for determining which union represents employees of a particular employer.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In some jurisdictional disputes, however, minority unions strike to compel employers to deal with them despite a legal duty to bargain with the majority union."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Strikes to compel an employer to violate the law are inexcusable.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Legislation to prevent such strikes is clearly desirable.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Another form of inter-union disagreement is the jurisdictional strike involving the question of which labor union is entitled to perform a particular task.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"When rival umons are unable to settle such disputes themselves, provision must be made for peaceful and binding determination of the issues."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"A second unjustifiable practice is the secondary boycott, when used to further jurisdictional disputes or to compel employers to violate the National Labor Relations Act."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Not all secondary boycotts are unjustified.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We must judge them on the basis of their objectives.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"For example, boycotts intended to protect wage rates and working conditions should be distinguished from those in furtherance of jurisdictional disputes."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The structure of industry sometimes requires unions, as a matter of self-preservation, to extend the conflict beyond a particular employer."
1947,Truman,Democratic,There should be no blanket prohibition against boycotts.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The appropriate goal is legislation which prohibits secondary boycotts in pursuance of unjustifiable objectives, but does not impair the union's right to preserve its own existence and the gains made in genuine collective bargaining."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"A third practice that should be corrected is the use of economic force, by either labor or management, to decide issues arising out of the interpretation of existing contracts."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Collective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should he faithfully adhered to by both parties."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In the most enlightened union-management relationships, disputes over the interpretation of contract terms are settled peaceably by negotiation or arbitration."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Legislation should be enacted to provide machinery whereby unsettled disputes concerning the interpretation of an existing agreement may be referred by either party to final and binding arbitration.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Point number two is the extension of facilities within the Department of Labor for assisting collective bargaining.
1947,Truman,Democratic,One of our difficulties in avoiding labor strife arises from a lack of order in the collective bargaining process.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The parties often do not have a clear understanding of their responsibility for settling disputes through their own negotiations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We constantly see instances where labor or management resorts to economic force without exhausting the possibilities for agreement through the bargaining process.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Neither the parties nor the Government have a definite yardstick for determining when and how Government assistance should be invoked.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"There is need for integrated governmental machinery to provide the successive steps of mediation, voluntary arbitration, and-ultimately in appropriate cases-ascertainment of the facts of the dispute and the reporting of the facts to the public."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Such machinery would facilitate and expedite the settlement of disputes.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Point number three is the broadening of our program of social legislation to alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"On June ii, 1946, in my message vetoing the Case Bill, I made a comprehensive statement of my views concerning labor-management relations."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I said then, and I repeat now, that the solution of labor-management difficulties is to be found not only in legislation dealing directly with labor relations, but also in a program designed to remove the causes of insecurity felt by many workers in our industrial society."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In this connection, for example, the Congress should consider the extension and broadening of our social security system, better housing, a comprehensive national health program, and provision for a fair minimum wage."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Point number four is the appointment of a Temporary Joint Commission to inquire into the entire field of labor-management relations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,I recommend that the Congress provide for the appointment of a Temporary Joint Commission to undertake this broad study.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The President, the Congress, and management and labor have a continuing responsibility to cooperate in seeking and finding the solution of these problems."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I therefore recommend that the Commission be composed as follows: twelve to be chosen by the Congress from members of both parties in the House and the Senate, and eight representing the public, management and labor, to be appointed by the President."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Commission should be charged with investigating and making recommendations upon certain major subjects, among others: First, the special and unique problem of nationwide strikes in vital industries affecting the public interest."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In particular, the Commission should examine into the question of how to settle or prevent such strikes without endangering our general democratic freedoms."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Upon a proper solution of this problem may depend the whole industrial future of the United States.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The paralyzing effects of a nationwide strike in such industries as transportation, coal, oil, steel, or communications can result in national disaster."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We have been able to avoid such disaster, in recent years, only by the use of extraordinary war powers."
1947,Truman,Democratic,All those powers will soon be gone.
1947,Truman,Democratic,In their place there must be created an adequate system and effective machinery in these vital fields.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"This prob1cm will require careful study and a bold approach, but an approach consistent with the preservation of the rights of our people."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The need is pressing.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The Commission should give this its earliest attention.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Second, the best methods and procedures for carrying out the collective bargaining process."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"This should include the responsibilities of labor and management to negotiate freely and fairly with each other, and to refrain from strikes or lockouts until all possibilities of negotiation have been exhausted."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Third, the underlying causes of labor management disputes."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Some of the subjects presented here for investigation involve long-range study.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Others can be considered immediately by the Commission and its recommendations can be submitted to the Congress in the near future.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I recommend that this Commission make its first report, including specific legislative recommendations, not later than March 15, 1947."
1947,Truman,Democratic,RESTRICTION OF MONOPOLY AND PROMOTION OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE The second major policy I desire to lay before you has to do with the growing concentration of economic power and the threat to free competitive private enterprise.
1947,Truman,Democratic,In 1941 the Temporary National Economic Committee completed a comprehensive investigation into the workings of the national economy.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Committee's study showed that, despite a half century of anti-trust law enforcement, one of the gravest threats to our welfare lay in the increasing concentration of power in the hands of a small number of giant organizations."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"During the war, this long-standing tendency toward economic concentration was accelerated."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"As a consequence, we now find that to a greater extent than ever before, whole industries are dominated by one or a few large organizations which can restrict production in the interest of higher profits and thus reduce employment and purchasing power."
1947,Truman,Democratic,In an effort to assure full opportunity and free competition to business we will vigorously enforce the anti-trust laws.
1947,Truman,Democratic,There is much the Congress can do to cooperate and assist in this program.
1947,Truman,Democratic,To strengthen and enforce the laws that regulate business practices is not enough.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Enforcement must be supplemented by positive measures of aid to new enterprises.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Government assistance, research programs, and credit powers should be designed and used to promote the growth of new firms and new industries."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Assistance to small business is particularly important at this time when thousands of veterans who are potential business and industrial leaders are beginning their careers.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We should also give special attention to the decentralization of industry and the development of areas that are now underindustrialized.
1947,Truman,Democratic,HOUSING The third major policy is also of great Importance to the national economy-an aggressive program to encourage home construction.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The first Federal program to relieve the veterans' housing shortage was announced in February 1946.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In 1946 one million family housing units have been put under construction and more than 665,000 units have already been completed."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The rate of expansion in construction has broken all records.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In the coming year the number of dwelling units built will approach, if not surpass, the top construction year of 1926."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The primary responsibility to deliver housing at reasonable prices that veterans can afford rests with private industry and with labor.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Government will continue to expedite the flow of key building materials, to limit nonresidential construction, and to give financial support where it will do the most good."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Measures to stimulate rental housing and new types of housing construction will receive special emphasis.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"To reach our long-range goal of adequate housing for all our people, comprehensive housing legislation is urgently required, similar to the non-partisan bill passed by the Senate last year."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"At a minimum, such legislation should open the way for rebuilding the blighted areas of our cities and should establish positive incentives for the investment of billions of dollars of private capital in large-scale rental housing projects."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"It should provide for improvement of housing in rural areas and for the construction, over a 4-year period, of half a million units of public low-rental housing."
1947,Truman,Democratic,It should authorize a single peacetime Federal housing agency to assure efficient use of our resources on the vast housing front.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"FISCAL AFFAIRS The fourth major policy has to do with the balancing of the budget. in a prosperous period such as the present one, the budget of the Federal Government should be balanced."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Prudent management of public finance requires that we begin the process of reducing the public debt.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The budget which I shall submit to you this week has a small margin of surplus.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In the Budget Message I am making recommendations which, if accepted, will result in a substantially larger surplus which should be applied to debt retirement."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"One of these recommendations is that the Congress take early action to continue throughout the next fiscal year the war excise tax rates which, under the present law, will expire on June 30, 1947."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Expenditures relating to the war are still high.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Considerable sums are required to alleviate world famine and suffering.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Aid to veterans will continue at peak level.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The world situation is such that large military expenditures are required.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Interest on the public debt and certain other costs are irreducible.
1947,Truman,Democratic,For these reasons I have had to practice stringent economy in preparing the budget; and I hope that the Congress will cooperate in this program of economy.
1947,Truman,Democratic,AGRICULTURE The fifth major policy has to do with the welfare of our farm population.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Production of food reached record heights in 1946.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Much of our tremendous grain crop can readily be sold abroad and thus will become no threat to our domestic markets.
1947,Truman,Democratic,But in the next few years American agriculture can face the same dangers it did after World War I.
1947,Truman,Democratic,In the early twenties the Nation failed to maintain outlets for the new productive capacity of our agricultural plant.
1947,Truman,Democratic,It failed to provide means to protect the farmer while he adjusted his acreage to peacetime demands.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The result we all remember too well.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Farm production stayed up while demand and prices fell, in contrast with industry where prices stayed up and output declined."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Farm surpluses piled up, and disaster followed."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We must make sure of meeting the problems which we failed to meet after the first World War.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Present laws give considerable stability to farm prices for 1947 and i948, and these 2 years must be utilized to maintain and develop markets for our great productive power."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The purpose of these laws was to permit an orderly transition from war to peace.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Government plan of support prices was not designed to absorb, at great cost, the unlimited surpluses of a highly productive agriculture."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We must not wait until the guarantees expire to set the stage for permanent farm welfare.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The farmer is entitled to a fair income.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Ways can be found to utilize his new skills and better practices, to expand his markets at home and abroad, and to carry out the objectives of a balanced pattern of peacetime production without either undue sacrifice by farm people or undue expense to the Government."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"HEALTH AND GENERAL WELFARE Of all our national resources, none is of more basic value than the health of our people."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Over a year ago I presented to the Congress my views on a national health program.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Congress acted on several of the recommendations in this program: mental health, the health of mothers and children, and hospital construction."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I urge this Congress to complete the work begun last year and to enact the most important recommendation of the program-to provide adequate medical care to all who need it, not as charity but on the basis of payments made by the beneficiaries of the program."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"One administrative change would help greatly to further our national program in the fields of health, education, and welfare."
1947,Truman,Democratic,I again recommend the establishment of a well-integrated Department of Welfare.
1947,Truman,Democratic,VETERANS Fourteen million World War II servicemen have returned to civil life.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The great majority have found their places as citizens of their communities and their Nation.
1947,Truman,Democratic,It is a tribute to the fiber of our servicemen and to the flexibility of our economy that these adjustments have been made so rapidly and so successfully.
1947,Truman,Democratic,More than two million of these veterans are attending schools or acquiring job skills through the financial assistance of the Federal Government.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Thousands of sick and wounded veterans are daily receiving the best of medical and hospital care.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Half a million have obtained loans, with Government guarantees, to purchase homes or farms or to embark upon new businesses."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Compensation is being paid in almost two million cases for disabilities or death.
1947,Truman,Democratic,More than three million are continuing to maintain their low-cost National Service Life Insurance policies.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Almost seven million veterans have been aided by unemployment and self employment allowances.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Exclusive of mustering-out payments and terminal leave pay, the program for veterans of all wars is costing over seven billion dollars a year - one-fifth of our total Federal budget."
1947,Truman,Democratic,This is the most far-reaching and complete veterans program ever conceived by any nation.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Except for minor adjustments, I believe that our program of benefits for veterans is now complete."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In the long run, the success of the program will not be measured by the number of veterans receiving financial aid or by the number of dollars we spend."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"History will judge us not by the money we spend, but by the further contribution we enable our veterans to make to their country."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In considering any additional legislation, that must be our criterion."
1947,Truman,Democratic,CIVIL RIGHTS We have recently witnessed in this country numerous attacks upon the constitutional rights of individual citizens as a result of racial and religious bigotry.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Substantial segments of our people have been prevented from exercising fully their right to participate in the election of public officials, both locally and nationally."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Freedom to engage in lawful callings has been denied.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The will to fight these crimes should be in the hearts of every one of us.
1947,Truman,Democratic,For the Federal Government that fight is now being carried on by the Department of Justice to the full extent of the powers that have been conferred upon it.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"While the Constitution withholds from the Federal Government the major task of preserving peace in the several States, I am not convinced that the present legislation reached the limit of Federal power to protect the civil rights of its citizens."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I have, therefore, by Executive order,1 established the President's Committee on Civil Rights to study and report on the whole problem of federally-secured civil rights, with a view to making recommendations to the Congress."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"NATURAL RESOURCES In our responsibility to promote the general welfare of the people, we have always to consider the natural resources of our country."
1947,Truman,Democratic,They are the foundation of our life.
1947,Truman,Democratic,In the development of the great river systems of America there is the major opportunity of our generation to contribute to the increase of the national wealth.
1947,Truman,Democratic,This program is already well along; it should be pushed with full vigor.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I must advise the Congress that we are rapidly becoming a ""have not"" Nation as to many of our minerals."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The economic progress and the security of our country depend upon an expanding return of mineral discovery and upon improved methods of recovery.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The Federal Government must do its part to meet this need.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Executive Order 9808 (3 CFR, '943-1948 Comp., p.590)."
1947,Truman,Democratic,FOREIGN AFFAIRS Progress in reaching our domestic goals is closely related to our conduct of foreign affairs.
1947,Truman,Democratic,All that I have said about maintaining a sound and prosperous economy and improving the welfare of our people has greater meaning because of the world leadership of the United States.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"What we do, or fail to do, at home affects not only ourselves but millions throughout the world."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"If we are to fulfill our responsibilities to ourselves and to other peoples, we must make sure that the United States is sound economically, socially, and politically."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Only then will we be able to help bring about the elements of peace in other countries-political stability, economic advancement, and social progress."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Peace treaties for Italy, Bulgaria, Rumania, and Hungary have finally been prepared."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Following the signing of these treaties next month in Paris, they will he submitted to the Senate for ratification."
1947,Truman,Democratic,This Government does not regard the treaties as completely satisfactory.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Whatever their defects, however, I am convinced that they are as good as we can hope to obtain by agreement among the principal wartime Allies."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Further dispute and delay would gravely jeopardize political stability in the countries concerned for many years.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"During the long months of debate on these treaties, we have made it clear to all nations that the United States will not consent to settlements at the expense of principles we regard as vital to a just and enduring peace."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We have made it equally clear that we will not retreat to isolationism.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Our policies will be the same during the forthcoming negotiations in Moscow on the German and Austrian treaties, and during the future conferences on the Japanese treaty."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The delay in arriving at the first peace settlements is due partly to the difficulty of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union on the terms of settlement.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Whatever differences there may have been between us and the Soviet Union, however, should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the basic interests of both nations lie in the early making of a peace under which the peoples of all countries may return, as free men and women, to the essential tasks of production and reconstruction."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The major concern of each of us should be the promotion of collective security, not the advancement of individual security."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Our policy toward the Soviet Union is guided by the same principles which determine our policies toward all nations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We seek only to uphold the principles of international justice which have been embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We must now get on with the peace settlements.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The occupying powers should recognize the independence of Austria and withdraw their troops.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Germans and the Japanese cannot be left in doubt and fear as to their future; they must know their national boundaries, their resources, and what reparations they must pay."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Without trying to manage their internal affairs, we can insure that these countries do not re-arm."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"INTERNATIONAL RELIEF AND DISPLACED PERSONS The United States can be proud of its part in caring for the peoples reduced to want by the ravages of war, and in aiding nations to restore their national economies."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We have shipped more supplies to the hungry peoples of the world since the end of the war than all other countries combined.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"However, insofar as admitting displaced persons is concerned, I do not feel that the United States has done its part."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"Only about 5,000 of them have entered this country since May, 1946."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The fact is that the executive agencies are now doing all that is reasonably possible under the limitation of the existing law and established quotas.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Congressional assistance in the form of new legislation is needed.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I urge the Congress to turn its attention to this world problem, in an effort to find ways whereby we can fulfill our responsibilities to these thousands of homeless and suffering refugees of all faiths."
1947,Truman,Democratic,INTERNATIONAL TRADE World economic cooperation is essential to world political cooperation.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We have made a good start on economic cooperation through the International Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Export Import Bank."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We must now take other Steps for the reconstruction of world trade and we should continue to Strive for an international trade system as free from obstructions as possible.
1947,Truman,Democratic,ATOMIC ENERGY The United States has taken the lead in the endeavor to put atomic energy under effective international control.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We seek no monopoly for ourselves or for any group of nations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We ask only that there be safeguards sufficient to insure that no nation will be able to use this power for military purposes.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"So long as all governments are not agreed on means of international control of atomic energy, the shadow of fear will obscure the bright prospects for the peaceful use of this enormous power."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the Commission established under that law is assuming full jurisdiction over domestic atomic energy enterprise."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The program of the Commission will, of course, be worked out in close collaboration with the military services in conformity with the wish of the Congress, but it is my fervent hope that the military significance of atomic energy will steadily decline."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We look to the Commission to foster the development of atomic energy for industrial use and scientific and medical research.
1947,Truman,Democratic,In the vigorous and effective development of peaceful uses of atomic energy rests our hope that this new force may ultimately be turned into a blessing for all nations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,MILITARY POLICY In 1946 the Army and Navy completed the demobilization of their wartime forces.
1947,Truman,Democratic,They are now maintaining the forces which we need for national defense and to fulfill our international obligations.
1947,Truman,Democratic,We live in a world in which strength on the part of peace4oving nations is still the greatest deterrent to aggression.
1947,Truman,Democratic,World stability can be destroyed when nations with great responsibilities neglect to maintain the means of discharging those responsibilities.
1947,Truman,Democratic,This is an age when unforeseen attack could come with unprecedented speed.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We must be strong enough to defeat, and thus forestall, any such attack."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"In our steady progress toward a more rational world order, the need for large armed forces is progressively declining; but the stabilizing force of American military strength must not be weakened until our hopes are fully realized."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"When a system of collective security under the United Nations has been established, we shall be willing to lead in collective disarmament, but, until such a system becomes a reality, we must not again allow ourselves to become weak and invite attack."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"For those reasons, we need well equipped, well trained armed forces and we must be able to mobilize rapidly our resources in men and material for our own defense, should the need arise."
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Army will be reduced to 1,070,000 officers and men by July I, 1947."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Half of the Army will be used for occupation duties abroad and most of the remainder will be employed at home in the support of these overseas forces.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The Navy is supporting the occupation troops in Europe and in the Far East.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Its fundamental mission-to support our national interests wherever required-is unchanged.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The Navy, including the Marine Corps, will average 571,000 officers and men during the fiscal year 1948."
1947,Truman,Democratic,We are encountering serious difficulties in maintaining our forces at even these reduced levels.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Occupation troops are barely sufficient to carry out the duties which our foreign policy requires.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Our forces at home are at a point where further reduction is impracticable.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"We should like an Army and a Navy composed entirely of long-term volunteers, but in spite of liberal inducements the basic needs of the Army are not now being met by voluntary enlistments."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The War Department has advised me that it is unable to make an accurate forecast at the present time as to whether it will be possible to maintain the strength of the Army by relying exclusively on volunteers.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"The situation will be much clearer in a few weeks, when the results of the campaign for volunteers are known."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The War Department will make its recommendations as to the need for the extension of Selective Service in sufficient time to enable the Congress to take action prior to the expiration of the present law on March 31st.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The responsibility for maintaining our armed forces at the strength necessary for our national safety rests with the Congress.
1947,Truman,Democratic,The development of a trained citizen reserve is also vital to our national security.
1947,Truman,Democratic,This can best be accomplished through universal training.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"I have appointed an Advisory Commission on Universal Training to study the various plans for a training program, and I expect that the recommendations of the Commission will be of benefit to the Congress and to me in reaching decisions on this problem."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The cost of the military establishment is substantial.
1947,Truman,Democratic,There is one certain way by which we can cut costs and at the same time enhance our national security.
1947,Truman,Democratic,That is by the establishment of a single Department of National Defense.
1947,Truman,Democratic,I shall communicate with the Congress in the near future with reference to the establishment of a single Department of National Defense.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"National security docs not consist only of an army, a navy, and an air force."
1947,Truman,Democratic,It rests on a much broader basis.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"It depends on a sound economy of prices and wages, on prosperous agriculture, on satisfied and productive workers, on a competitive private enterprise free from monopolistic repression, on continued industrial harmony and production, on civil liberties and human freedoms in all the forces which create in our men and women a strong moral fiber and spiritual stamina."
1947,Truman,Democratic,But we have a higher duty and a greater responsibility than the attainment of our own national security.
1947,Truman,Democratic,Our goal is collective security for all mankind.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"If we can work in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect, we can fulfill this solemn obligation which rests upon us."
1947,Truman,Democratic,The spirit of the American people can set the course of world history.
1947,Truman,Democratic,"If we maintain and strengthen our cherished ideals, and if we share our great bounty with war-stricken people over the world, then the faith of our citizens in freedom and democracy will be spread over the whole earth and free men everywhere will share our devotion to those ideals."
1947,Truman,Democratic,Let us have the will and the patience to do this job together.
1947,Truman,Democratic,May the Lord strengthen us in our faith.
1947,Truman,Democratic,May He give us wisdom to lead the peoples of the world in His ways of peace.
1948,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"TRUMAN'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 7, 1948 Mr."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Speaker, and Members of the 80th Congress: We are here today to consider the state of the Union."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"On this occasion, above all others, the Congress and the President should concentrate their attention, not upon party but upon the country; not upon things which divide us but upon those which bind us together-the enduring principles of our American syst em, and our common aspirations for the future welfare and security of the people of the United States."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The United States has become great because we, as a people, have been able to work together for great objectives even while differing about details."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The elements of our strength are many.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"They include our democratic government, our economic system, our great natural resources."
1948,Truman,Democratic,But these are only partial explanations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The basic source of our strength is spiritual.
1948,Truman,Democratic,For we are a people with a faith.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We believe in the dignity of man.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We believe that he was created in the image of the Father of us all.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We do not believe that men exist merely to strengthen the state or to be cogs in the economic machine.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We do believe that governments are created to serve the people and that economic systems exist to minister to their wants.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We have a profound devotion to the welfare and rights of the individual as a human being.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The faith of our people has particular meaning at this time in history because of the unsettled and changing state of the world.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The victims of war in many lands are striving to rebuild their lives, and are seeking assurance that the tragedy of war will not occur again."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Throughout the world new ideas are challenging the old.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Men of all nations are re-examining the beliefs by whi ch they live.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Great scientific and industrial changes have released new forces which will affect the future course of civilization.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The state of our Union reflects the changing nature of the modern world.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"On all sides there is heartening evidence of great energy-of capacity for economic development-and even more important, capacity for spiritual growth."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"But accompanying this great a ctivity there are equally great questions, great anxieties, and great aspirations."
1948,Truman,Democratic,They represent the concern of an enlightened people that conditions should be so arranged as to make life more worthwhile.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must devote ourselves to finding answers to these anxieties and aspirations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We seek answers which will embody the moral and spiritual elements of tolerance, unselfishness, and brotherhood upon which true freedom and opportunity must rest."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"As we examine the state of our Union today, we can benefit from viewing it on a basis of the accomplishments of the last decade and of our goals for the next."
1948,Truman,Democratic,How far have we come during the last 10 years and how far can we go in the next 10?
1948,Truman,Democratic,It was 10 years ago that the determination of dictators to wage war upon mankind became apparent.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The years that followed brought untold death and destruction.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We shared in the human suffering of the war, but we were fortunate enough to escape most of war's destruction."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We were able through these 10 years to expand the productive strength of our farms and factories.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"More important, however, is the fact that these years brought us new courage, new confidence in the ideals of our free democracy."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our deep belief in freedom and justice was reinforced in the crucible of war.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"On the foundations of our greatly strengthened economy and our renewed confidence in democratic values, we can continue to move forward."
1948,Truman,Democratic,There are some who look with fear and distrust upon planning for the future.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Yet our great national achievements have been attained by those with vision.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Our Union was formed, our frontiers were pushed back, and our great industries were built by men wh o looked ahead."
1948,Truman,Democratic,I propose that we look ahead today toward those goals for the future which have the greatest bearing upon the foundations of our democracy and the happiness of our people.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"I do so, confident in the thought that with clear objectives and with firm determination, we can, in the next 10 years, build upon the accomplishments of the past decades to achieve a glorious future."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Year by year, beginning now, we must make a substan tial part of this progress."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our first goal is to secure fully the essential human rights of our citizens.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The United States has always had a deep concern for human rights.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Religious freedom, free speech, and freedom of thought are cherished realities in our land."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Any denial of human rights is a denial of the basic beliefs of democracy and of our regard for the worth of each individual.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Today, however, some of our citizens are still denied equal opportunity for education, for jobs and economic advancement, and for the expression of their views at the polls."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Most serious of all, some are denied equal protection under laws."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Whether discri mination is based on race, or creed, or color, or land of origin, it is utterly contrary to American ideals of democracy."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The recent report of the President's Committee on Civil Rights points the way to corrective action by the Federal Government and by State and local governments.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Because of the need for effective Federal action, I shall send a special message to the Cong ress on this important subject."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We should also consider our obligation to assure the fullest possible measure of civil rights to the people of our territories and possessions.
1948,Truman,Democratic,I believe that the time has come for Alaska and Hawaii to be admitted to the Union as States.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our second goal is to protect and develop our human resources.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The safeguarding of the rights of our citizens must be accompanied by an equal regard for their opportunities for development and their protection from economic insecurity.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"In this Nation the ideals of freedom and equality can be given specific meaning in terms of health, education, social security, and housing."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Over the past 12 years we have erected a sound framework of social security legislation.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Many millions of our citizens are now protected against the loss of income which can come with unemployment, old age, or the death of wage earners."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Yet our system has gaps and inconsistencies; it is only half finished.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We should now extend unemployment compensation, old age benefits, and survivors' benefits to millions who are not now protected."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We should also raise the level of benefits.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The greatest gap in our social security structure is the lack of adequate provision for the Nation's health.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are rightly proud of the high standards of medical care we know how to provide in the United States.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The fact is, however, that most of our p eople cannot afford to pay for the care they need."
1948,Truman,Democratic,I have often and strongly urged that this condition demands a national health program.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The heart of the program must be a national system of payment for medical care based on well-tried insurance principles.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This great Nation cannot afford to allow its c itizens to suffer needlessly from the lack of proper medical care.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our ultimate aim must be a comprehensive insurance system to protect all our people equally against insecurity and ill health.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Another fundamental aim of our democracy is to provide an adequate education for every person.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our educational systems face a financial crisis.
1948,Truman,Democratic,It is deplorable that in a Nation as rich as ours there are millions of children who do not have adequate schoolhouses or enough teachers for a good elementary or secondary education.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"If there are educat ional inadequacies in any State, the whole Nation suffers."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The Federal Government has a responsibility for providing financial aid to meet this crisis.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, we must make possible greater equality of opportunity to all our citizens for education."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Only by so doing can we insure that our citizens will be capable of understanding and sharing the responsibilities of democracy.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The Government's programs for health, education, and security are of such great importance to our democracy that we should now establish an executive department for their administration."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Health and education have their beginning in the home.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"No matter what our hospitals or schools are like, the youth of our Nation are handicapped when millions of them live in city slums and country shacks."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Within the next decade, we must see that every A merican family has a decent home."
1948,Truman,Democratic,As an immediate step we need the long range housing program which I have recommended on many occasions to this Congress.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This should include financial aids designed to yield more housing at lower prices.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"It should provi de public housing for low-income families, and vigorous development of new techniques to lower the cost of building."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Until we can overcome the present drastic housing shortage, we must extend and strengthen rent control."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We have had, and shall continue to have, a special interest in the welfare of our veterans."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Over 14 million men and women who served in the armed forces in World War II have now returned to civilian life.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Over 2 million veterans are being helped through school.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Millions have been aided while finding jobs, and have been helped in buying homes, in obtaining medical care, and in adjusting themselves to physical handicaps."
1948,Truman,Democratic,All but a very few veterans have successfully made the transition from military life to their home communities.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The success of our veterans' program is proved by this fact.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This Nation is proud of the eagerness shown by our veterans to become self-relian t and self-supporting citizens.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our third goal is to conserve and use our natural resources so that they can contribute most effectively to the welfare of our people.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The resources given by nature to this country are rich and extensive.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The material foundations of our growth and economic development are the bounty of our fields, the wealth of our mines and forests, and the energy of our waters."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"As a Nation, we are co ming to appreciate more each day the close relationship between the conservation of these resources and the preservation of our national strength."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are doing far less than we know how to do to make use of our resources without destroying them.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Both the public and private use of these resources must have the primary objective of maintaining and increasing these basic supports for an expanding fut ure.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must continue to take specific steps toward this goal.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must vigorously defend our natural wealth against those who would misuse it for selfish gain.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We need accurate and comprehensive knowledge of our mineral resources and must intensify our efforts to develop new supplies and to acquire stockpiles of scarce materials.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We need to protect and restore our land public and private-through combating erosion and rebuilding the fertility of the soil.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We must expand our reclamation program to bring millions of acres of arid land into production, and to improve water supplies for additional millions of acres."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"This will provide new opportunities for veterans and others, particularly in the West, and ai d in providing a rising living standard for a growing population."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must protect and restore our forests by sustained-yield forestry and by planting new trees in areas now slashed and barren.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We must continue to erect multiple-purpose dams on our great rivers-not only to reclaim land, but also to prevent floods, to extend our inland waterways and to provide hydroelectric power."
1948,Truman,Democratic,This public power must not be monopolized for private gain.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Only through well established policies of transmitting power directly to its market and thus encouraging widespread use at low rates can the Federal Government assure the people of their full share of its benefits.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Additional power - public and private - i s needed to raise the ceilings now imposed by power shortages on industrial and agricultural development.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We should achieve the wise use of resources through the integrated development of our great river basins.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We can learn much from our Tennessee Valley experience.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We should no longer delay in applying the lessons of that vast undertaking to our other gre at river basins.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our fourth goal is to lift the standard of living for all our people by strengthening our economic system and sharing more broadly among our people the goods we produce.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The amazing economic progress of the past 10 years points the way for the next 10.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Today 14 million more people have jobs than in 1938.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our yearly output of goods and services has increased by two-thirds.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The average income of our people, measured in dollars of equal purchasing power, has increased-after taxes-by more than 50 percent."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"In no other 10 years have farmers, businessmen, and wage earners made such great gains."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We may not be able to expand as rapidly in the next decade as in the last, because we are now starting from full employment and very high production."
1948,Truman,Democratic,But we can increase our annual output by at least one-third above the present level.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We can lift our sta ndard of living to nearly double what it was 10 years ago.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"If we distribute these gains properly, we can go far toward stamping out poverty in our generation."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"To do this, agriculture, business, and labor must move forward together."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Permanent farm prosperity and agricultural abundance will be achieved only as our whole economy grows and prospers.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The farmer can sell more food at good prices when the incomes of wage earners are high and when there is full employment.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Adequate diets for every American family, and the needs of our industries at full production, will absorb a farm output well above our present levels."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Although the average farmer is now better off than ever before, farm families as a whole have only begun to catch up with the standards of living enjoyed in the cities."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"In 1946, the average income of farm people was $779, contrasted with an average incom e of $1,288 for non-farm people."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Within the next decade, we should eliminate elements of inequality in these living standards."
1948,Truman,Democratic,To this end our farm program should enable the farmer to market his varied crops at fair price levels and to improve his standard of living.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We need to continue price supports for major farm commodities on a basis which will afford reasonable protection against fluctuations in the levels of production and demand.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The present price support program must be reexamined and modernized.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Crop insurance should be strengthened and its benefits extended in order to protect the farmer against the special hazards to which he is subject.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We also need to improve the means for getting farm products into markets and into the hands of consumers.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Cooperatives which directly or indirectly serve this purpose must be encouraged - not discouraged.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The school lunch program should be continued and adequately financed.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We need to go forward with the rural electrification program to bring the benefits of electricity to all our farm population.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We can, and must, aid and encourage farmers to conserve their soil resources and restore the fertility of the land that has suffered from neglect or unwise use."
1948,Truman,Democratic,All these are practical measures upon which we should act immediately to enable agriculture to make its full contribution to our prosperity.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must also strengthen our economic system within the next decade by enlarging our industrial capacity within the framework of our free enterprise system.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are today far short of the industrial capacity we need for a growing future.
1948,Truman,Democratic,At least $50 billion should be invested by industry to improve and expand our productive facilities over the next few years.
1948,Truman,Democratic,But this is only the beginning.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The industrial ap plication of atomic energy and other scientific advances will constantly open up further opportunities for expansion.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Farm prosperity and high employment will call for an immensely increased output of goods and services.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Growth and vitality in our economy depend on vigorous private enterprise.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Free competition is the key to industrial development, full production and employment, fair prices, and an ever improving standard of living."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Competition is seriously limited tod ay in many industries by the concentration of economic power and other elements of monopoly.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The appropriation of sufficient funds to permit proper enforcement of the present antitrust laws is essential.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Beyond that we should go on to strengthen our leg islation to protect competition.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Another basic element of a strong economic system is the well-being of the wage earners.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We have learned that the well-being of workers depends on high production and consequent high employment.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We have learned equally well that the welfare of industry and agriculture depends on high incomes for our workers.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The Government has wisely chosen to set a floor under wages.
1948,Truman,Democratic,But our 40-cent minimum wage is inadequate and obsolete.
1948,Truman,Democratic,I recommend the lifting of the minimum wage to 75 cents an hour.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"In general, however, we must continue to rely on our sound system of collective bargaining to set wage scales."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Workers' incomes should increase at a rate consistent with the maintenance of sound price, profit, and wage relationships and with increase of productivity."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The Government's part in labor-management relations is now largely controlled by the terms of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947.
1948,Truman,Democratic,I made my attitude clear on this act in my veto message to the Congress last June.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Nothing has occurred since to ch ange my opinion of this law.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"As long as it remains the law of the land, however, I shall carry out my constitutional duty and administer it."
1948,Truman,Democratic,As we look ahead we can understand the crucial importance of restraint and wisdom in arriving at new labor-management contracts.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Work stoppages would result in a loss of production-a loss which could bring higher prices for our citizens and could also d eny the necessities of life to the hard pressed peoples of other lands.
1948,Truman,Democratic,It is my sincere hope that the representatives of labor and of industry will bear in mind that the Nation as a whole has a vital stake in the success of their bargaining efforts.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"If we surmount our current economic difficulties, we can move ahead to a great increase in our national income which will enable all our people to enjoy richer and fuller lives."
1948,Truman,Democratic,All of us must advance together.
1948,Truman,Democratic,One fifth of our families now have average annual incomes of less than $850.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We must see that our gains in national income are made more largely available to those with low incomes, whose need is greatest."
1948,Truman,Democratic,This will bene fit us all through providing a stable foundation of buying power to maintain prosperity.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Business, labor, agriculture, and Government, working together, must develop the policies which will make possible the realization of the full benefits of our economic system."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our fifth goal is to achieve world peace based on principles of freedom and justice and the equality of all nations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Twice within our generation, world wars have taught us that we cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We have learned that the loss of freedom in any area of the world means a loss of freedom to ourselves - that the loss of independence by any nation adds directly to the insecurity of the United States and all free nations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We have learned that a healthy world economy is essential to world peace-that economic distress is a disease whose evil effects spread far beyond the boundaries of the afflicted nation.
1948,Truman,Democratic,For these reasons the United States is vigorously following policies designed to achieve a peaceful and prosperous world.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We are giving, and will continue to give, our full support to the United Nations."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"While that organization has encountered unforeseen and unwelcome difficulties, I am confident of its ultimate success."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are also devoting our efforts toward world econom ic recovery and the revival of world trade.
1948,Truman,Democratic,These actions are closely related and mutually supporting.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We believe that the United States can be an effective force for world peace only if it is strong.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We look forward to the day when nations will decrease their armaments.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Yet so long as there remains serious opposition to the ideals of a peaceful world, w e must maintain strong armed forces."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The passage of the National Security Act by the Congress at its last session was a notable step in providing for the security of this country.
1948,Truman,Democratic,A further step which I consider of even greater importance is the early provision for universal training.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"There are many elements in a balanced national security program, all interrelated and necessary, but universal training should be the foundation for them all."
1948,Truman,Democratic,A favorable decision by the Congress at an early date is of world importance.
1948,Truman,Democratic,I am convinced that su ch action is vital to the security of this Nation and to the maintenance of its leadership.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The United States is engaged today in many international activities directed toward the creation of lasting peaceful relationships among nations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We have been giving substantial aid to Greece and Turkey to assist those nations in preserving their integrity against foreign pressures.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Had it not been for our aid, their situation today might well be radically different."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The continued integrity of th ose countries will have a powerful effect upon other nations in the Middle East and in Europe struggling to maintain their independence while they repair the damages of war.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The United States has special responsibilities with respect to the countries in which we have occupation forces: Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our efforts to reach agreements on peace settlements for these countries have so far been blocked.
1948,Truman,Democratic,But we shall continue to exert our utmost efforts to obtain satisfactory settlements for each of these nations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Many thousands of displaced persons, still living in camps overseas, should be allowed entry into the United States."
1948,Truman,Democratic,I again urge the Congress to pass suitable legislation at once so that this Nation may do its share in caring for the homeless and suffer ing refugees of all faiths.
1948,Truman,Democratic,I believe that the admission of these persons will add to the strength and energy of this Nation.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are moving toward our goal of world peace in many ways.
1948,Truman,Democratic,But the most important efforts which we are now making are those which support world economic reconstruction.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are seeking to restore the world trading system which was shattered by the war an d to remedy the economic paralysis which grips many countries.
1948,Truman,Democratic,To restore world trade we have recently taken the lead in bringing about the greatest reduction of world tariffs that the world has ever seen.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The extension of the provisions of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which made this achievement possible, is of extreme importance."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We must also go on to support the International Trade Organization, through which we hope to obtain worldwide agreement on a code of fair conduct in international trade."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Our present major effort toward economic reconstruction is to support the program for recovery developed by the countries of Europe.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"In my recent message to the Congress, I outlined the reasons why it is wise and necessary for the United States to extend this support."
1948,Truman,Democratic,I want to reaffirm my belief in the soundness and the promise of this proposal.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"When the European economy is strengthened, the product of its industry will be of benefit to many other areas of economic distress."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The ability of free men to overcome hunger and despair will be a moral stimulus to the entire world.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We intend to work also with other nations in achieving world economic recovery.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We shall continue our cooperation with the nations of the Western Hemisphere.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"A special program of assistance to China, to provide urgent relief needs and to speed reconstru ction, will be submitted to the Congress."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Unfortunately, not all governments share the hope of the people of the United States that economic reconstruction in many areas of the world can be achieved through cooperative effort among nations."
1948,Truman,Democratic,In spite of these differences we will go forward with o ur efforts to overcome economic paralysis.
1948,Truman,Democratic,No nation by itself can carry these programs to success; they depend upon the cooperative and honest efforts of all participating countries.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Yet the leadership is inevitably ours.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"I consider it of the highest importance that the Congress should authorize support for the European recovery program for the period from April 1, 1948, to June 30, 1952, with an initial amount for the first 15 months of $6.8 billion."
1948,Truman,Democratic,I urge the Congress to act promptly on this vital measure of our foreign policy this decisive contribution to world peace.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We are following a sound, constructive, and practical course in carrying out our determination to achieve peace."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We are fighting poverty, hunger, and suffering."
1948,Truman,Democratic,This leads to peace-not war.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We are building toward a world where all nations, large and small alike, may live free from the fear of aggression."
1948,Truman,Democratic,This leads to peace-not war.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Above all else, we are striving to achieve a concord among the peoples of the world based upon the dignity of the individual and the brotherhood of man."
1948,Truman,Democratic,This leads to peace-not war.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"We can go forward with confidence that we are following sound policies, both at home and with other nations, which will lead us toward our great goals for economic, social and moral achievement."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"As we enter the new year, we must surmount one major problem which affects all our goals."
1948,Truman,Democratic,That is the problem of inflation.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Already inflation in this country is undermining the living standards of millions of families.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Food costs too much.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Housing has reached fantastic price levels.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Schools and hospitals are in financial distress.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Inflation threatens to bring on disagreem ent and strife between labor and management.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Worst of all, inflation holds the threat of another depression, just as we had a depression after the unstable boom following the First World War."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"When I announced last October that the Congress was being called into session, I described the price increases which had taken place since June 1946."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Wholesale prices had increased 40 percent; retail prices had increased 23 percent.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Since October prices have continued to rise.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Wholesale prices have gone up at an annual rate of 18 percent.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Retail prices have gone up at an annual rate of 10 percent.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The events which have occurred since I presented my 10-point anti-inflation program to the Congress in November have made it even clearer that all in points are essential.
1948,Truman,Democratic,High prices must not be our means of rationing.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must deal effectively and at once with the high cost of living.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We must stop the spiral of inflation.
1948,Truman,Democratic,I trust that within the shortest possible time the Congress will make available to the Government the weapons that are so desperately needed in the fight against inflation.
1948,Truman,Democratic,One of the most powerful anti-inflationary factors in our economy today is the excess of Government revenues over expenditures.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Government expenditures have been and must continue to be held at the lowest safe levels.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Since V-J day Federal expenditures have been sharply reduced.
1948,Truman,Democratic,They have been cut from more than $63 billion in the fiscal year 1946 to less than $38 billion in the present fiscal year.
1948,Truman,Democratic,The number of civilian employees has been cut nearly in half-from 3/4 million down to 2 million.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"On the other hand, Government revenues must not be reduced."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Until inflation has been stopped there should be no Cut in taxes that is not offset by additions at another point in our tax structure.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Certain adjustments should be made within our existing tax structure that will not affect total receipts, yet will adjust the tax burden so that those least able to pay will have their burden lessened by the transfer of a portion of it to those best able to pay."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Many of our families today are suffering hardship because of the high cost of living.
1948,Truman,Democratic,At the same time profits of corporations have reached an all-time record in 1947.
1948,Truman,Democratic,Corporate profits total $17 billion after taxes.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"This compared with $12.5 billion in 1 946, the previous high year."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"Because of this extraordinarily high level of profits, corporations can well afford to carry a larger share of the tax load at this time."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"During this period in which the high cost of living is bearing down on so many of our families, tax adjustments should be made to ease their burden."
1948,Truman,Democratic,The low-income group particularly is being pressed very hard.
1948,Truman,Democratic,To this group a tax adjustment would resul t in a saving that could be used to buy the necessities of life.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"I recommend therefore that, effective January I, 1948, a cost of living tax credit be extended to our people consisting of a credit of $40 to each individual taxpayer and an additional credit of $40 for each dependent."
1948,Truman,Democratic,Thus the income tax of a man with a wife and two children would be reduced $160.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"The credit would be extended to all taxpayers, but it would be particular helpful to those in the low-income group."
1948,Truman,Democratic,It is estimated that such a tax credit would reduce Federal revenue by $3.2 billion.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This reduction should be made up by increasing the tax on corporate profits in an amount that will produce this sum-with appropriate adjustments for small corporations.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This is the proper method of tax relief at this time.
1948,Truman,Democratic,It gives relief to those who need it most without cutting the total tax revenue of the Government.
1948,Truman,Democratic,When the present danger of inflation has passed we should consider tax reduction based upon a revision of our entire tax structure.
1948,Truman,Democratic,"When we have conquered inflation, we shall be in a position to move forward toward our chosen goals."
1948,Truman,Democratic,"As we do so, let us keep ever before us our high purposes."
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are determined that every citizen of this Nation shall have an equal right and an equal opportunity to grow in wisdom and in stature and to take his place in the control of his Nation's destiny.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are determined that the productive resources of this Nation shall be used wisely and fully for the benefit of all.
1948,Truman,Democratic,We are determined that the democratic faith of our people and the strength of our resources shall contribute their full share to the attainment of enduring peace in the world.
1948,Truman,Democratic,It is our faith in human dignity that underlies these purposes.
1948,Truman,Democratic,It is this faith that keeps us a strong and vital people.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This is a time to remind ourselves of these fundamentals.
1948,Truman,Democratic,For today the whole world looks to us for leadership.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This is the hour to rededicate ourselves to the faith in mankind that makes us strong.
1948,Truman,Democratic,This is the hour to rededicate ourselves to the faith in God that gives us confidence as we face the challenge of the years ahead.
1949,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"TRUMAN'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 5, 1949 Mr."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Speaker, Members of the Congress: I am happy to report to this 81st Congress that the state of the Union is good."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Our Nation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the American people, and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness."
1949,Truman,Democratic,This great Republic is foremost among the nations of the world in the search for peace.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"During the last 16 years, our people have been creating a society which offers new opportunities for every man to enjoy his share of the good things of life."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"In this society, we are conservative about the values and principles which we cherish; but we are forward-looking in protecting those values and principles and in extending their benefits."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We have rejected the discredited theory that the fortunes of the Nation should be in the hands of a privileged few.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We have abandoned the ""trickle-down"" concept of national prosperity."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Instead, we believe that our economic system should rest on a democratic foundation and that wealth should be created for the benefit of all."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The recent election shows that the people of the United States are in favor of this kind of society and want to go on improving it.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The American people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease.
1949,Truman,Democratic,We have pledged our common resources to help one another in the hazards and struggles of individual life.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We believe that no unfair prejudice or artificial distinction should bar any citizen of the United States of America from an education, or from good health, or from a job that he is capable of performing."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The attainment of this kind of society demands the best efforts of every citizen in every walk of life, and it imposes increasing responsibilities on the Government."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The Government must work with industry, labor, and the farmers in keeping our economy running at full speed."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The Government must see that every American has a chance to obtain his fair share of our increasing abundance.
1949,Truman,Democratic,These responsibilities go hand in hand.
1949,Truman,Democratic,We cannot maintain prosperity unless we have a fair distribution of opportunity and a widespread consumption of the products of our factories and farms.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our Government has undertaken to meet these responsibilities.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We have made tremendous public investments in highways, hydroelectric power projects, soil conservation, and reclamation."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We have established a system of social security.
1949,Truman,Democratic,We have enacted laws protecting the rights and the welfare of our working people and the income of our farmers.
1949,Truman,Democratic,These Federal policies have paid for themselves many times over.
1949,Truman,Democratic,They have strengthened the material foundations of our democratic ideals.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Without them, our present prosperity would be impossible."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Reinforced by these policies, our private enterprise system has reached new heights of production."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Since the boom year of 1929, while our population has increased by only 20 percent, our agricultural production has increased by 45 percent, and our industrial production has increased by 75 percent."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We are turning out far more goods and more wealth per worker than we have ever done before.
1949,Truman,Democratic,This progress has confounded the gloomy prophets-at home and abroad-who predicted the downfall of American capitalism.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The people of the United States, going their own way, confident in their own powers, have achieved the greatest prosperity the world has even seen."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"But, great as our progress has been, we still have a long way to go."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"As we look around the country, many of our shortcomings stand out in bold relief."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We are suffering from excessively high prices.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our production is still not large enough to satisfy our demands.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our minimum wages are far too low.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Small business is losing ground to growing monopoly.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our farmers still face an uncertain future.
1949,Truman,Democratic,And too many of them lack the benefits of our modern civilization.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Some of our natural resources are still being wasted.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We are acutely short of electric power, although the means for developing such power are abundant."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Five million families are still living in slums and firetraps.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Three million families share their homes with others.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our health is far behind the progress of medical science.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Proper medical care is so expensive that it is out of the reach of the great majority of our citizens.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Our schools, in many localities, are utterly inadequate."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our democratic ideals are often thwarted by prejudice and intolerance.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Each of these shortcomings is also an opportunity-an opportunity for the Congress and the President to work for the good of the people.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Our first great opportunity is to protect our economy against the evils of ""boom and bust."" This objective cannot be attained by government alone."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Indeed, the greater part of the task must be performed by individual efforts under our system of free enterprise."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We can keep our present prosperity, and increase it, only if free enterprise and free government work together to that end."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We cannot afford to float along ceaselessly on a postwar boom until it collapses.
1949,Truman,Democratic,It is not enough merely to prepare to weather a recession if it comes.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Instead, government and business must work together constancy to achieve more and more jobs and more and more production-which mean more and more prosperity for all the people."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The business cycle is man-made; and men of good will, working together, can smooth it out."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"So far as business is concerned, it should plan for steady, vigorous expansion-seeking always to increase its output, lower its prices, and avoid the vices of monopoly and restriction."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"So long as business does this, it will be contributing to continued prosperity, and it will have the help and encouragement of the Government."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The Employment Act of 1946 pledges the Government to use all its resources to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power."
1949,Truman,Democratic,This means that the Government is firmly committed to protect business and the people against the dangers of recession and against the evils of inflation.
1949,Truman,Democratic,This means that the Government must adapt its plans and policies to meet changing circumstances.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"At the present time, our prosperity is threatened by inflationary pressures at a number of critical points in our economy."
1949,Truman,Democratic,And the Government must be in a position to take effective action at these danger spots.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"To that end, I recommend that the Congress enact legislation for the following purposes: First, to continue the power to control consumer credit and enlarge the power to control bank credit."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Second, to grant authority to regulate speculation on the commodity exchanges."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Third, to continue export control authority and to provide adequate machinery for its enforcement."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Fourth, to continue the priorities and allocation authority in the field of transportation."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Fifth, to authorize priorities and allocations for key materials in short supply."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Sixth, to extend and strengthen rent control."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Seventh, to provide standby authority to impose price ceilings for scarce commodities which basically affect essential industrial production or the cost of living, and to limit unjustified wage adjustments which would force a break in an established price ceiling."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Eighth, to authorize an immediate study of the adequacy of production facilities for materials in critically short supply, such as steel; and, if found necessary, to authorize Government loans for the expansion of production facilities to relieve such shortages, and to authorize the construction of such facilities directly, if action by private industry fails to meet our needs."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The Economic Report, which I shall submit to the Congress shortly, will discuss in detail the economic background for these recommendations."
1949,Truman,Democratic,One of the most important factors in maintaining prosperity is the Government's fiscal policy.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"At this time, it is essential not only that the Federal budget be balanced, but also that there be a substantial surplus to reduce inflationary pressures, and to permit a sizable reduction in the national debt, which now stands at $252 billion."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"I recommend, therefore, that the Congress enact new tax legislation to bring in an additional $4 billion of Government revenue."
1949,Truman,Democratic,This should come principally from additional corporate taxes.
1949,Truman,Democratic,A portion should come from revised estate and gift taxes.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Consideration should be given to raising personal income rates in the middle and upper brackets.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"If we want to keep our economy running in high gear, we must be sure that every group has the incentive to make its full contribution to the national welfare."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"At present, the working men and women of the Nation are unfairly discriminated against by a statute that abridges their rights, curtails their constructive efforts, and hampers our system of free collective bargaining."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"That statute is the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, sometimes called the Taft-Hartley Act."
1949,Truman,Democratic,That act should be repealed!
1949,Truman,Democratic,The Wagner Act should be reenacted.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"However, certain improvements, which I recommended to the Congress 2 years ago, are needed."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Jurisdictional strikes and unjustified secondary boycotts should be prohibited.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The use of economic force to decide issues arising out of the interpretation of existing contracts should be prevented.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Without endangering our democratic freedoms, means should be provided for setting up machinery for preventing strikes in vital industries which affect the public interest."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The Department of Labor should be rebuilt and strengthened and those units properly belonging within that department should be placed in it.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The health of our economy and its maintenance at high levels further require that the minimum wage fixed by law should be raised to at least 75 cents an hour.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"If our free enterprise economy is to be strong and healthy, we must reinvigorate the forces of competition."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We must assure small business the freedom and opportunity to grow and prosper.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"To this purpose, we should strengthen our antitrust laws by closing those loopholes that permit monopolistic mergers and consolidations."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Our national farm program should be improved-not only in the interest of the farmers, but for the lasting prosperity of the whole Nation."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our goals should he abundant farm production and parity income for agriculture.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Standards of living on the farm should be just as good as anywhere else in the country.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Farm price supports are an essential part of our program to achieve these ends.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Price supports should be used to prevent farm price declines which are out of line with general price levels, to facilitate adjustments in production to consumer demands, and to promote good land use."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our price support legislation must be adapted to these objectives.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide adequate storage space for crops should be restored.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Our program for farm prosperity should also seek to expand the domestic market for agricultural products, particularly among low-income groups, and to increase and stabilize foreign markets."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We should give special attention to extending modern conveniences and services to our farms.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Rural electrification should be pushed forward.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"And in considering legislation relating to housing, education, health, and social security, special attention should be given to rural problems."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Our growing population and the expansion of our economy depend upon the wise management of our land, water, forest, and mineral wealth."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"In our present dynamic economy, the task of conservation is not to lockup our resources but to develop and improve them."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Failure, today, to make the investments which are necessary to support our progress in the future would be false economy."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We must push forward the development of our rivers for power, irrigation, navigation, and flood control."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We should apply the lessons of our Tennessee Valley experience to our other great river basins.
1949,Truman,Democratic,I again recommend action be taken by the Congress to approve the St.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Lawrence Seaway and Power project.
1949,Truman,Democratic,This is about the fifth time I have recommended it.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We must adopt a program for the planned use of the petroleum reserves under the sea, which are-and must remain-vested in the Federal Government."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We must extend our programs of soil conservation.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We must place our forests on a sustained yield basis, and encourage the development of new sources of vital minerals."
1949,Truman,Democratic,In all this we must make sure that the benefits of these public undertakings are directly available to the people.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Public power should be earned to consuming areas by public transmission lines where necessary to provide electricity at the lowest possible rates.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Irrigation waters should serve family farms and not land speculators.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The Government has still other opportunities-to help raise the standard of living of our citizens.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"These opportunities lie in the fields of social security, health, education, housing, and civil rights."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The present coverage of the social security laws is altogether inadequate; the benefit payments are too low.
1949,Truman,Democratic,One-third of our workers are not covered.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Those who receive old-age and survivors insurance benefits receive an average payment of only $25 a month.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Many others who cannot work because they are physically disabled are left to the mercy of charity.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We should expand our social security program, both as to the size of the benefits and the extent of coverage, against the economic hazards due to unemployment, old age, sickness, and disability."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We must spare no effort to raise the general level of health in this country.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"In a nation as rich as ours, it is a shocking fact that tens of millions lack adequate medical care."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We are short of doctors, hospitals, nurses."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We must remedy these shortages.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Moreover, we need-and we must have without further delay-a system of prepaid medical insurance which will enable every American to afford good medical care."
1949,Truman,Democratic,It is equally shocking that millions of our children are not receiving a good education.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Millions of them are in overcrowded, obsolete buildings."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We are short of teachers, because teachers' salaries are too low to attract new teachers, or to hold the ones we have."
1949,Truman,Democratic,All these school problems will become much more acute as a result of the tremendous increase in the enrollment in our elementary schools in the next few years.
1949,Truman,Democratic,I cannot repeat too strongly my desire for prompt Federal financial aid to the States to help them operate and maintain their school systems.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The governmental agency which now administers the programs of health, education, and social security should be given full departmental status."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The housing shortage continues to be acute.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"As an immediate step, the Congress should enact the provisions for low-rent public housing, slum clearance, farm housing, and housing research which I have repeatedly recommended."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The number of low-rent public housing units provided for in the legislation should be increased to 1 million units in the next 7 years.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Even this number of units will not begin to meet our need for new housing.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Most of the houses we need will have to be built by private enterprise, without public subsidy."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"By producing too few rental units and too large a proportion of high-priced houses, the building industry is rapidly pricing itself out of the market."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Building costs must be lowered.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The Government is now engaged in a campaign to induce all segments of the building industry to concentrate on the production of lower priced housing.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Additional legislation to encourage such housing will be submitted.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The authority which I have requested, to allocate materials in short supply and to impose price ceilings on such materials, could be used, if found necessary, to channel more materials into homes large enough for family life at prices which wage earners can afford."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The driving force behind our progress is our faith in our democratic institutions.
1949,Truman,Democratic,That faith is embodied in the promise of equal rights and equal opportunities which the founders of our Republic proclaimed to their countrymen and to the whole world.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The fulfillment of this promise is among the highest purposes of government.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The civil rights proposals I made to the 80th Congress, I now repeat to the 81st Congress."
1949,Truman,Democratic,They should be enacted in order that the Federal Government may assume the leadership and discharge the obligations clearly placed upon it by the Constitution.
1949,Truman,Democratic,I stand squarely behind those proposals.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our domestic programs are the foundation of our foreign policy.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"The world today looks to us for leadership because we have so largely realized, within our borders, those benefits of democratic government for which most of the peoples of the world are yearning."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We are following a foreign policy which is the outward expression of the democratic faith we profess.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We are doing what we can to encourage free states and free peoples throughout the world, to aid the suffering and afflicted in foreign lands, and to strengthen democratic nations against aggression."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The heart of our foreign policy is peace.
1949,Truman,Democratic,We are supporting a world organization to keep peace and a world economic policy to create prosperity for mankind.
1949,Truman,Democratic,Our guiding star is the principle of international cooperation.
1949,Truman,Democratic,To this concept we have made a national commitment as profound as anything in history.
1949,Truman,Democratic,To it we have pledged our resources and our honor.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Until a system of world security is established upon which we can safely rely, we cannot escape the burden of creating and maintaining armed forces sufficient to deter aggression."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We have made great progress in the last year in the effective organization of our Armed Forces, but further improvements in our national security legislation are necessary."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Universal training is essential to the security of the United States.
1949,Truman,Democratic,During the course of this session I shall have occasion to ask the Congress to consider several measures in the field of foreign policy.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"At this time, I recommend that we restore the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act to full effectiveness, and extend it for 3 years."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We should also open our doors to displaced persons without unfair discrimination.
1949,Truman,Democratic,It should be clear by now to all citizens that we are not seeking to freeze the status quo.
1949,Truman,Democratic,We have no intention of preserving the injustices of the past.
1949,Truman,Democratic,We welcome the constructive efforts being made by many nations to achieve a better life for their citizens.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"In the European recovery program, in our good-neighbor policy and in the United Nations, we have begun to batter down those national walls which block the economic growth and the social advancement of the peoples of the world."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"We believe that if we hold resolutely to this course, the principle of international cooperation will eventually command the approval even of those nations which are now seeking to weaken or subvert it."
1949,Truman,Democratic,We stand at the opening of an era which can mean either great achievement or terrible catastrophe for ourselves and for all mankind.
1949,Truman,Democratic,The strength of our Nation must continue to be used in the interest of all our people rather than a privileged few.
1949,Truman,Democratic,It must continue to be used unselfishly in the struggle for world peace and the betterment of mankind the world over.
1949,Truman,Democratic,This is the task before us.
1949,Truman,Democratic,It is not an easy one.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"It has many complications, and there will be strong opposition from selfish interests."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"I hope for cooperation from farmers, from labor, and from business."
1949,Truman,Democratic,Every segment of our population and every individual has a right to expect from our Government a fair deal.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"In 1945, when I came down before the Congress for the first time on April 16, I quoted to you King Solomon's prayer that he wanted wisdom and the ability to govern his people as they should be governed."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"I explained to you at that time that the task before me was one of the greatest in the history of the world, and that it was necessary to have the complete cooperation of the Congress and the people of the United States."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Well now, we are taking a new start with the same situation."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"It is absolutely essential that your President have the complete cooperation of the Congress to carry out the great work that must be done to keep the peace in this world, and to keep this country prosperous."
1949,Truman,Democratic,The people of this great country have a right to expect that the Congress and the President will work in closest cooperation with one objective-the welfare of the people of this Nation as a whole.
1949,Truman,Democratic,In the months ahead I know that I shall be able to cooperate with this Congress.
1949,Truman,Democratic,"Now, I am confident that the Divine Power which has guided us to this time of fateful responsibility and glorious opportunity will not desert us now."
1949,Truman,Democratic,"With that help from Almighty God which we have humbly acknowledged at every turning point in our national life, we shall be able to perform the great tasks which He now sets before us."
1950,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"TRUMAN'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 4, 1950 Mr."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Speaker, Members of the Congress: A year ago I reported to this Congress that the state of the Union was good."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I am happy to be able to report to you today that the state of the Union Continues to be good.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our Republic continues to increase in the enjoyment of freedom within its borders, and to offer strength and encouragement to all those who love freedom throughout the world."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"During the past year we have made notable progress in strengthening the foundations of peace and freedom, abroad and at home."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have taken important steps in securing the North Atlantic community against aggression.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have continued our successful support of European recovery.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have returned to our established policy of expanding international trade through reciprocal agreement.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have strengthened our support of the United Nations.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"While great problems still confront us, the greatest danger has receded-the possibility which faced us 3 years ago that most of Europe and the Mediterranean area might collapse under totalitarian pressure."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Today, the free peoples of the world have new vigor and new hope for the cause of peace."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In our domestic affairs, we have made notable advances toward broader opportunity and a better life for all our citizens."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have met and reversed the first significant downturn in economic activity since the war.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In accomplishing this, Government programs for maintaining employment and purchasing power have been of tremendous benefit."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"As the result of these programs, and the wisdom and good judgment of our businessmen and workers, major readjustments have been made without widespread suffering."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"During the past year, we have also made a good start in providing housing for low-income groups; we have raised minimum wages; we have gone forward with the development of our natural resources; we have given a greater assurance of stability to the farmer; and we have improved the organization and efficiency of our Government."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Today, by the grace of God, we stand a free and prosperous nation with greater possibilities for the future than any people ever had before in the history of the world."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We are now, in this year of 1950, nearing the midpoint of the 20th century."
1950,Truman,Democratic,The first half of this century will be known as the most turbulent and eventful period in recorded history.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The swift pace of events promises to make the next 50 years decisive in the history of man on this planet.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The scientific and industrial revolution which began two centuries ago has, in the last 50 years, caught up the peoples of the globe in a common destiny."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Two world-shattering wars have proved that no corner of the earth can be isolated from the affairs of mankind.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The human race has reached a turning point.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Man has opened the secrets of nature and mastered new powers.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If he uses them wisely, he can reach new heights of civilization."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If he uses them foolishly, they may destroy him."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Man must create the moral and legal framework for the world which will insure that his new powers are used for good and not for evil.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In shaping the outcome, the people of the United States will play a leading role."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Among all the great changes that have occurred in the last 50 years, none is more important than the change in the position of the United States in world affairs."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Fifty years ago we were a country devoted largely to our own internal affairs.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our industry was growing, and we had new interests in the Far East and in the Caribbean, but we were primarily concerned with the development of vast areas of our own continental territory."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Today, our population has doubled."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our national production has risen from about $50 billion, in terms of today's prices, to the staggering figure of $255 billion a year."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have a more productive economic system and a greater industrial potential than any other nation on the globe.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our standard of living is an inspiration for all other peoples.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Even the slightest changes in our economic and social life have their effect on other countries all around the world.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our tremendous strength has brought with it tremendous responsibilities.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have moved from the outer edge to the center of world affairs.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Other nations look to us for a wise exercise of our economic and military strength, and for vigorous support of the ideals of representative government and a free society."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We will not fail them.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our objective in the world is peace.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our country has joined with others in the task of achieving peace.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We know now that this is not an easy task, or a short one."
1950,Truman,Democratic,But we are determined to see it through.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Both of our great political parties are committed to working together-and I am sure they will continue to work together-to achieve this end.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We are prepared to devote our energy and our resources to this task, because we know that our own security and the future of mankind are at stake."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Right here, I want to say that no one appreciates more than I the bipartisan cooperation in foreign affairs which has been enjoyed by this administration."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our success in working with other nations to achieve peace depends largely on what we do at home.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We must preserve our national strength.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Strength is not simply a matter of arms and force.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"It is a matter of economic growth, and social health, and vigorous institutions, public and private."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We can achieve peace only if we maintain our productive energy, our democratic institutions, and our firm belief in individual freedom."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our surest guide in the days that lie ahead will be the spirit in which this great Republic was founded.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We must make our decisions in the conviction that all men are created equal, that they are equally entided to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that the duty of government is to serve these ends."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"This country of ours has experienced many blessings, but none greater than its dedication to these principles."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"At every point in our history, these ideals have served to correct our failures and shortcomings, to spur us on to greater efforts, and to keep clearly before us the primary purpose of our existence as a nation."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"They have enshrined for us, a principle of government, the moral imperative to do justice, and the divine command to men to love one another."
1950,Truman,Democratic,These principles give meaning to all that we do.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In foreign policy, they mean that we can never be tolerant of oppression or tyranny."
1950,Truman,Democratic,They mean that we must throw our weight on the side of greater freedom and a better life for all peoples.
1950,Truman,Democratic,These principles confirm us in carrying out the specific programs for peace which we have already begun.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We shall continue to give our wholehearted support to the United Nations.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We believe that this organization can ultimately provide the framework of international law and morality without which mankind cannot survive.
1950,Truman,Democratic,It has already set up new standards for the conduct of nations in the Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on Genocide.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"It is moving ahead to give meaning to the concept of world brotherhood through a wide variety of cultural, economic, and technical activities."
1950,Truman,Democratic,The events of the past year again showed the value of the United Nations in bringing about the peaceful adjustment of tense international controversies.
1950,Truman,Democratic,In Indonesia and in Palestine the efforts of the United Nations have put a stop to bloodshed and paved the way to peaceful settlements.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We are working toward the time when the United Nations will control weapons of mass destruction and will have the forces to preserve international law and order.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"While the world remains unsettled, however, and as long as our own security and the security of the free world require, we will maintain a strong and well-balanced defense organization."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The Selective Service System is an essential part of our defense plans, and it must be continued."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Under the principles of the United Nations Charter we must continue to share in the common defense of free nations against aggression.
1950,Truman,Democratic,At the last session this Congress laid the basis for this joint effort.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We now must put into effect the common defense plans that are being worked out.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We shall continue our efforts for world economic recovery, because world prosperity is the only sure foundation of a permanent peace."
1950,Truman,Democratic,As an immediate means to this end we must continue our support of the European recovery program.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"This program has achieved great success in the first 2 years of its operation, but it has not yet been completed."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If we were to stop this program now, or cripple it, just because it is succeeding, we should be doing exactly what the enemies of democracy want us to do."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We should be just as foolish as a man who, for reasons of false economy, failed to put a roof on his house after building the foundation and the walls."
1950,Truman,Democratic,World prosperity also requires that we do all we can to expand world trade.
1950,Truman,Democratic,As a major step in this direction we should promptly join the International Trade Organization.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The purpose of this organization, which the United States has been foremost in creating, is to establish a code of fair practice, and an international authority for adjusting differences in international commercial relations."
1950,Truman,Democratic,It is an effort to prevent the kind of anarchy and irresponsibility in world trade which did so much to bring about the world depression of the 1930's.
1950,Truman,Democratic,An expanding world economy requires the improvement of living standards and the development of resources in areas where human poverty and misery now prevail.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Without such improvement the recovery of Europe and the future of our own economy will not be secure.
1950,Truman,Democratic,I urge that the Congress adopt the legislation now before it to provide for increasing the flow of technical assistance and capital investment in underdeveloped regions.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"It is more essential now than ever, if the ideals of freedom and representative government are to prevail in these areas, and particularly in the Far East, that their peoples experience, in their own lives, the benefits of scientific and economic advances."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"This program will require the movement of large amounts of capital from the industrial nations, and particularly from the United States, to productive uses in the underdeveloped areas of the world."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Recent world events make prompt action imperative.
1950,Truman,Democratic,This program is in the interest of all peoples-and has nothing in common with either the old imperialism of the last century or the new imperialism of the Communists.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our aim for a peaceful, democratic world of free peoples will be achieved in the long run, not by force of arms, but by an appeal to the minds and hearts of men."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If the peace policy of the democratic nations is to be successful, they must demonstrate that the benefits of their way of life can be increased and extended to all nations and all races."
1950,Truman,Democratic,In the world today we are confronted with the danger that the rising demand of people everywhere for freedom and a better life may be corrupted and betrayed by the false promises of communism.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In its ruthless struggle for power, communism seizes upon our imperfections, and takes advantage of the delays and setbacks which the democratic nations experience in their effort to secure a better life for their citizens."
1950,Truman,Democratic,This challenge to us is more than a military challenge.
1950,Truman,Democratic,It is a challenge to the honesty of our profession of the democratic faith; it is a challenge to the efficiency and stability of our economic system; it is a challenge to the willingness to work with other peoples for world peace and for world prosperity.
1950,Truman,Democratic,For my part I welcome that challenge.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"I believe that our country, at this crucial point in world history, will meet that challenge successfully."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"I believe that, in cooperation with the other free nations of the world, we shall extend the full benefits of the democratic way of life to millions who do not now enjoy them, and preserve mankind from dictatorship and tyranny."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"I believe that we shall succeed in our struggle for this peace, because I have seen the success we have had in our own country in following the principles of freedom."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Over the last 50 years, the ideals of liberty and equal opportunity to which this Nation is dedicated have been increasingly realized in the lives of our people."
1950,Truman,Democratic,The ideal of equal opportunity no longer means simply the opportunity which a man has to advance beyond his fellows.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Some of our citizens do achieve greater success than others as a reward for individual merit and effort, and this is as it should be."
1950,Truman,Democratic,At the same time our country must be more than a land of opportunity for a select few.
1950,Truman,Democratic,It must be a land of opportunity for all of us.
1950,Truman,Democratic,In such a land we can grow and prosper together.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The simple truth that we can all go forward together is often questioned by selfish or shortsighted persons.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"It is strange that this is so, for this proposition is so clearly demonstrated by our national history."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"During the last 50 years, for example, our Nation has grown enormously in material wellbeing."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"This growth has come about, not by concentrating the benefits of our progress in the hands of a few, but by increasing the wealth of the great body of our Nation and our citizens."
1950,Truman,Democratic,In the last 50 years the income of the average family has increased so greatly that its buying power has doubled.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The average hours of work have declined from 60 to 40 a week, the whole hourly production of the average worker has tripled."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Average wages, allowing for price changes, have increased from about 45 cents an hour to $I.40 an hour."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We have accomplished what to earlier ages of mankind would have been a miracle-we work shorter hours, we produce more, and we live better."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Increasing freedom from poverty and drudgery has given a fuller meaning to American life.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our people are better educated; we have more opportunities for travel and recreation and enjoyment of the arts.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We enjoy more personal liberty in the United States today than ever before.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If we can continue in the spirit of cooperative adventure which has marked the recent years of our progress, we can expect further scientific advances, further increases in our standard of living, and a still wider enjoyment of democratic freedom."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"No one, of course, can foretell the future exactly."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"However, if we assume that we shall grow as fast in the future as we have grown in the past, we can get a good idea of how much our country should grow in the next 50 years."
1950,Truman,Democratic,At present our total national production is $255 billion a year.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Our working population and our output per worker are increasing.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If our productive power continues to increase at the same rate as it has increased over the past 50 years, our total national production 50 years from now will be nearly four times as much as it is today."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Allowing for the expected growth in population, this would mean that the real income of the average family in the year 2000 A.D. would be ahout three times what it is today."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"These are estimates of what we can do in the future, but we can reach these heights only if we follow the right policies."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have learned by bitter experience that progress is not automatic-that wrong policies lead to depression and disaster.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We cannot achieve these gains unless we have a stable economy and avoid the catastrophes of boom and bust that have set us back in the past.
1950,Truman,Democratic,These gains cannot be achieved unless our businessmen maintain their spirit of initiative and enterprise and operate in a competitive economy.
1950,Truman,Democratic,They cannot be achieved unless our workingmen and women and their unions help to increase productivity and obtain for labor a fair share of the benefits of our economic system.
1950,Truman,Democratic,They cannot be achieved unless we have a stable and prosperous agriculture.
1950,Truman,Democratic,They cannot be achieved unless we conserve and develop our natural resources in the public interest.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our system will not work unless our people are healthy, well-educated, and confident of the future."
1950,Truman,Democratic,It will not work unless all citizens can participate fully in our national life.
1950,Truman,Democratic,In achieving these gains the Government has a special responsibility to help create and maintain the conditions which will permit the growth we know is possible.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Foremost among these conditions is the need for a fair distribution of our increasing prosperity among all the great groups of our population who help to bring it about - labor, business, agriculture."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Businessmen must continue to have the incentives necessary for investment and for the development of new lines of enterprise.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In the future growth of this country, lie possibilities for hundreds of thousands of new and independent businesses."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"As our national production increases, as it doubles and redoubles in the next 50 years, the number of independent and competing enterprises should also increase."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If the number does not increase, our constantly growing economy will fall under the control of a few dominant economic groups whose powers will be so great that they will be a challenge to democratic institutions."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"To avoid this danger, we must curb monopoly and provide aids to independent business so that it may have the credit and capital to compete in a system of free enterprise."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I recommend that the Congress complete action at this session on the pending bill to close the loopholes in the Clayton Act which now permit monopolistic mergers.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"I also hope before this session is over to transmit to the Congress a series of proposals to strengthen the antimonopoly laws, to assist small business, and to encourage the growth of new enterprises."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In the case of labor, free collective bargaining must be protected and encouraged."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Collective bargaining is not only a fundamental economic freedom for labor.
1950,Truman,Democratic,It is also a strengthening and stabilizing influence for our whole economy.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The Federal statute now governing labor relations is punitive in purpose and onesided in operation.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"This statute is, and always has been, inconsistent with the practice of true and effective collective bargaining."
1950,Truman,Democratic,It should be repealed and replaced by a law that is fair to all and in harmony with our democratic ideals.
1950,Truman,Democratic,A full understanding of the problems of modern labor relations is of such importance that I recommend the establishment of a labor extension service to encourage educational activities in this field.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Another essential for our continued growth is a stable and prosperous agriculture.
1950,Truman,Democratic,For many years we have been building a program to give the farmer a reasonable measure of protection against the special hazards to which he is exposed.
1950,Truman,Democratic,That program was improved at the last session of the Congress.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"However, our farm legislation is still not adequate."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Although the Congress has properly declared as a matter of national policy that safeguards must be maintained against slumps in farm prices, there are serious shortcomings in the methods now available for carrying out this policy."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Mandatory price supports should be provided for the commodities not now covered which are major sources of farm income.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Moreover, we should provide a method of supporting farm income at fair levels which will, at the same time, avoid piling up unmanageable surpluses and allow consumers to obtain the full benefit of our abundant agricultural production."
1950,Truman,Democratic,A system of production payments gives the greatest promise of accomplishing this purpose.
1950,Truman,Democratic,I recommend that the use of such a system be authorized.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"One of the most important factors in our continued growth is the construction of more good, up-to-date housing."
1950,Truman,Democratic,In a country such as ours there is no reason why decent homes should not be within the reach of all.
1950,Truman,Democratic,With the help of various Government programs we have made great progress in the last few years in increasing the number of homes.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Despite this increase, there is still an acute shortage of housing for the lower and middle-income groups, especially in large metropolitan areas."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have laid the groundwork for relieving the plight of lower-income families in the Housing Act of 1949.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"To aid the middle-income families, I recommend that the Congress enact new legislation authorizing a vigorous program to help co-operatives and other nonprofit groups build housing which these families can afford."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Rent control has done a great deal to prevent the housing shortage from having had worse effects during this postwar period of adjustment.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Rent control is still necessary to prevent widespread hardship and sharp curtailment of the buying power of millions of consumers in metropolitan areas.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"I recommend, therefore, that rent control be continued for another year."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"If we are to achieve a better life for all, the natural resources of the country must be regarded as a public trust."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We must use our precious assets of soil, water, and forest, and grassland in such a way that they become constantly more productive and more valuable."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Government investment in the conservation and development of our resources is necessary to the future economic expansion of the country.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We need to enlarge the production and transmission of public power.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"That is true not only in those regions which have already received great benefits from Federal power projects, but also in regions such as New England where the benefits of large-scale public power development have not yet been experienced."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In our hydroelectric and irrigation undertakings, as well as in our other resource programs, we must continue policies to assure that their benefits will be spread among the many and not restricted to the favored few."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Important resource legislation which should be passed at this session includes the authorization of the St.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Lawrence seaway and power project and the establishment of the Columbia Valley Administration - the establishment of the Columbia Valley Administration, I don't want you to miss that."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Through wise Government policies and Government expenditures for the conservation and development of our natural resources, we can be sure of transmitting to our children and our children's children a country far richer and more productive than the one we know today."
1950,Truman,Democratic,The value of our natural resources is constantly being increased by the progress of science.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Research is finding new ways of using such natural assets as minerals, sea water, and plant life."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In the peaceful development of atomic energy, particularly, we stand on the threshold of new wonders."
1950,Truman,Democratic,The first experimental machines for producing useful power from atomic energy are now under construction.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We have made only the first beginnings in this field, but in the perspective of history they may loom larger than the first airplane, or even the first tools that started man on the road to civilization."
1950,Truman,Democratic,To take full advantage of the increasing possibilities of nature we must equip ourselves with increasing knowledge.
1950,Truman,Democratic,Government has a responsibility to see that our country maintains its position in the advance of science.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"As a step toward this end, the Congress should complete action on the measure to create a National Science Foundation."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Another duty of the Government is to promote the economic security, the health, and the education of its citizens."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"By so doing, we strengthen both our economy and the structure of our society."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In a nation as rich as ours, all citizens should be able to live in decency and health."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our Social Security System should be developed into the main reliance of our people for basic protection against the economic hazards of old-age, unemployment, and illness."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I earnestly hope that the Congress will complete action at this session on legislation to increase the benefits and extend the coverage of old-age and survivors insurance.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The widespread movement to provide pensions in private industry dramatizes the need for improvements in the public insurance system.
1950,Truman,Democratic,I also urge that the Congress strengthen our unemployment compensation law to meet present-day needs more adequately.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The economic downturn of the past year was the first real test that our system of unemployment insurance has had to meet.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"That test has proved the wisdom of the system, but it has also made strikingly apparent the need for improving its operation and increasing its coverage and its benefits."
1950,Truman,Democratic,In the field of health there are immense opportunities to extend to more of our people the benefits of the amazing advances in medical science.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We have made a good beginning in expanding our hospitals, but we must also go on to remedy the shortages of doctors, nurses, and public health services, and to establish a system of medical insurance which will enable all Americans to afford good medical care."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We must take immediate steps to strengthen our educational system.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In many parts of our country, young people are being handicapped for life because of a poor education."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The rapidly increasing number of children of school age, coupled with the shortage of qualified teachers, makes this problem more critical each year."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I believe that the Congress should no longer delay in providing Federal assistance to the States so that they can maintain adequate schools.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"As we go forward in achieving greater economic security and greater opportunity for all our people, we should make every effort to extend the benefits of our democratic institutions to every citizen."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The religious ideals which we profess, and the heritage of freedom which we have received from the past, clearly place that duty upon us."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I again urge the Congress to enact the civil rights proposals I made in February 1948.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"These proposals are for the enactment of Federal statutes which will protect all our people in the exercise of their democratic rights and their search for economic opportunity, grant statehood to Alaska and Hawaii, provide a greater measure of self-government for our island possessions, and accord home rule to the District of Columbia."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Some of those proposals have been before the Congress for a long time.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Those who oppose them, as well as those who favor them, should recognize that it is the duty of the elected representatives of the people to let these proposals come to a vote."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"Our democratic ideals, as well as our best interests, require that we do our fair share in providing homes for the unfortunate victims of war and tyranny."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"In so doing, we shall add strength to our democracy through the abilities and skills which these men and women will bring here."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I urge the prompt enactment by the Congress of the legislation now before it to extend and broaden the existing displaced persons law and remove its discriminatory features.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The measures I am recommending to the Congress concerning both our foreign and our domestic policies represent a carefully considered program to meet our national needs.
1950,Truman,Democratic,It is a program which necessarily requires large expenditures of funds.
1950,Truman,Democratic,More than 70 percent of the Government's expenditures are required to meet the costs of past wars and to work for world peace.
1950,Truman,Democratic,This is the dominant factor in our fiscal policy.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"At the same time, the Government must make substantial expenditures which are necessary to the growth and expansion of the domestic economy."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"At present, largely because of the ill-considered tax reduction of the 80th Congress, the Government is not receiving enough revenue to meet its necessary expenditures."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"To meet this situation, I am proposing that Federal expenditures be held to the lowest levels consistent with our international requirements and the essential needs of economic growth, and the well-being of our people."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I think I had better read that over; you interrupted me in the middle.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"To meet this situation, I am proposing that Federal expenditures be held to the lowest levels consistent with our international requirements and the essential needs of ceonomic growth, and the well-being of our people."
1950,Truman,Democratic,Don't forget that last phrase.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"At the same time, we must guard against the folly of attempting budget slashes which would impair our prospects for peace or cripple the programs essential to our national strength."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"The budget recommendations I shall shortly transmit to the Congress show that we can expect a substantial improvement in our fiscal position over the next few years, as the cost of some of our extraordinary postwar programs declines, and as the Government revenue rises as a result of growth in employment and national income."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"To further improve our fiscal outlook, we should make some changes in our tax system which will reduce present inequities, stimulate business activity, and yield a moderate amount of additional revenue."
1950,Truman,Democratic,I expect to transmit specific recommendations to the Congress on this subject at a very early date.
1950,Truman,Democratic,The fiscal policy I am recommending is the quickest and safest way of achieving a balanced budget.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"As we move forward into the second half of the 20th century, we must always bear in mind the central purpose of our national life."
1950,Truman,Democratic,We do not seek material prosperity for ourselves because we love luxury; we do not aid other nations because we wish to increase our power.
1950,Truman,Democratic,We have not devised programs for the security and well-being of our people because we are afraid or unwilling to take risks.
1950,Truman,Democratic,This is not the meaning of our past history or our present course.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We work for a better life for all, so that all men may put to good use the great gifts with which they have been endowed by their Creator."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"We seek to establish those material conditions of life in which, without exception, men may live in dignity, perform useful work, serve their communities, and worship God as they see fit."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"These may seem simple goals, but they are not little ones."
1950,Truman,Democratic,They are worth a great deal more than all the empires and conquests of history.
1950,Truman,Democratic,They are not to be achieved by military aggression or political fanaticism.
1950,Truman,Democratic,"They are to be achieved by humbler means---by hard work, by a spirit of self-restraint in our dealings with one another, and by a deep devotion to the principles of justice and equality."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"It should make us truly thankful, as we look back to the beginnings of this country, that we have come so far along the road to a better life for all."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"It should make us humble to think, as we look ahead, how much farther we have to go to accomplish, at home and abroad, the objectives that were set out for us at the founding of this great Nation."
1950,Truman,Democratic,"As we approach the halfway mark of the 20th century, we should ask for continued strength and guidance from that Almighty Power who has placed before us such great opportunities for the good of mankind in the years to come."
1951,Truman,Democratic,PRESIDENT HARRY S.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"TRUMAN'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 8, 1951 Mr."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Speaker, Members Of the Congress: This 82d Congress faces as grave a task as any Congress in the history of our Republic."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The actions you take will be watched by the whole world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"These actions will measure the ability of a free people, acting through their chosen representatives and their free institutions, to meet a deadly challenge to their way of life."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We can meet this challenge foolishly or wisely.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We can meet it timidly or bravely, shamefully or honorably."
1951,Truman,Democratic,I know that the 82d Congress will meet this challenge in a way worthy of our great heritage.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"I know that your debates will be earnest, responsible, constructive, and to the point."
1951,Truman,Democratic,I know that from these debates there will come the great decisions needed to carry us forward.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"At this critical time, I am glad to say that our country is in a healthy condition."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our democratic institutions are sound and strong.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have more men and women at work than ever before.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are able to produce more than ever before in fact, far more than any country ever produced in the history of the world."
1951,Truman,Democratic,I am confident that we can succeed in the great task that lies before us.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We will succeed, but we must all do our part."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must all act together as citizens of this great Republic.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"As we meet here today, American soldiers are fighting a bitter campaign in Korea."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We pay tribute to their courage, devotion, and gallantry."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Our men are fighting, alongside their United Nations allies, because they know, as we do, that the aggression in Korea is part of the attempt of the Russian Communist dictatorship to take over the world, step by step."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Our men are fighting a long way from home, but they are fighting for our lives and our liberties."
1951,Truman,Democratic,They are fighting to protect our right to meet here today-our right to govern ourselves as a free nation.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The threat of world conquest by Soviet Russia endangers our liberty and endangers the kind of world in which the free spirit of man can survive.
1951,Truman,Democratic,This threat is aimed at all peoples who strive to win or defend their own freedom and national independence.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Indeed, the state of our Nation is in great part the state of our friends and allies throughout the world."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The gun that points at them points at us, also."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The threat is a total threat and the danger is a common danger.
1951,Truman,Democratic,All free nations are exposed and all are in peril.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Their only security lies in banding together.
1951,Truman,Democratic,No one nation can find protection in a selfish search for a safe haven from the storm.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The free nations do not have any aggressive purpose.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We want only peace in the world-peace for all countries.
1951,Truman,Democratic,No threat to the security of any nation is concealed in our plans and programs.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We had hoped that the Soviet Union, with its security assured by the Charter of the United Nations, would be willing to live and let live."
1951,Truman,Democratic,But I am sorry to say that has not been the case.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The imperialism of the czars has been replaced by the even more ambitious, more crafty, and more menacing imperialism of the rulers of the Soviet Union."
1951,Truman,Democratic,This new imperialism has powerful military forces.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It is keeping millions of men under arms.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It has a large air force and a strong submarine force.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It has complete control of the men and equipment of its satellites.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It has kept its subject peoples and i ts economy in a state of perpetual mobilization.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The present rulers of the Soviet Union have shown that they are willing to use this power to destroy the free nations and win domination over the whole world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The Soviet imperialists have two ways of going about their destructive work.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"They use the method of subversion and internal revolution, and they use the method of external aggression."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"In preparation for either of these methods of attack, they stir up cl ass strife and disorder."
1951,Truman,Democratic,They encourage sabotage.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They put out poisonous propaganda.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They deliberately try to prevent economic improvement.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If their efforts are successful, they foment a revolution, as they did in Czechoslovakia and China, and as they tried, unsuccessfully, to do in Greece."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If their methods of subversion are blocked, and if they think they can get away with outright warfare, they resort to external aggression."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"This is what they did when they loosed the armies of their puppet states against the Republic of Korea, in an evil war by proxy."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We of the free world must be ready to meet both of these methods of Soviet action.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must not neglect one or the other.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The free world has power and resources to meet these two forms of aggression resources that are far greater than those of the Soviet dictatorship.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We have skilled and vigorous peoples, great industrial strength, and abundant sources of raw materials."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"And above all, we cherish liberty."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our common ideals are a great part of our strength.
1951,Truman,Democratic,These ideals are the driving force of human progress.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The free nations believe in the dignity and the worth of man.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We believe in independence for all nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We believe that free and independent nations can band together into a world order based on law.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have laid the cornerstone of such a peaceful world in the United Nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We believe that such a world order can and should spread the benefits of modern science and industry, better health and education, more food and rising standards of living-throughout the world."
1951,Truman,Democratic,These ideals give our cause a power and vitality that Russian communism can never command.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The free nations, however, are bound together by more than ideals."
1951,Truman,Democratic,They are a real community bound together also by the ties of self-interest and self-preservation.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If they should fall apart, the results would be fatal to human freedom."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our own national security is deeply involved with that of the other free nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"While they need our support, we equally need theirs."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our national safety would be gravely prejudiced if the Soviet Union were to succeed in harnessing to its war machine th e resources and the manpower of the free nations on the borders of its empire.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If Western Europe were to fall to Soviet Russia, it would double the Soviet supply of coal and triple the Soviet supply of steel."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If the free countries of Asia and Africa should fall to Soviet Russia, we would lose the sources of many of our most vital r aw materials, including uranium, which is the basis of our atomic power."
1951,Truman,Democratic,And Soviet command of the manpower of the free nations of Europe and Asia would confront us with military forces which we could never hope to equal.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"In such a situation, the Soviet Union could impose its demands on the world, without resort to conflict, simply through the preponderance of its economic and military power."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The Soviet Union does not have to attack the United States to secure domination of the world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It can achieve its ends by isolating us and swallowing up all our allies.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Therefore, even if we were craven enough-I do not believe we could be-but, I say, even if we were craven enough to aband on our ideals, it would be disastrous for us to withdraw from the community of free nations."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are the most powerful single member of this community, and we have a special responsibility."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must take the leadership in meeting the challenge to freedom and in helping to protect the rights of independent nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"This country has a practical, realistic protect gram of action for meeting this challenge."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"First, we shall have to extend economic assistance, where it can be effective."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The best way to stop subversion by the Kremlin is to strike at the roots of social injustice and economic disorder.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"People who have jobs, homes, and hopes for the future will defend themselves against the underground agents of the Kremlin."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our programs of economic aid have done much to turn back communism.
1951,Truman,Democratic,In Europe the Marshall plan has had an electrifying result.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"As European recovery progressed, the strikes led by the Kremlin's agents in Italy and France failed."
1951,Truman,Democratic,All over Western Europe the Communist Party took worse and worse beatings at the polls.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The countries which have received Marshall Plan aid have been able, through hard work, to expand their productive strength in many cases, to levels higher than ever before in their history."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Without this strength they would be completely incapable of def ending themselves today.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They are now ready to use this strength in helping to build a strong combined defense against aggression.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We shall need to continue some economic aid to European countries.
1951,Truman,Democratic,This aid should now be specifically related to the building of their defenses.
1951,Truman,Democratic,In other parts of the world our economic assistance will need to be more broadly directed toward economic development.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"In the Near East, in Africa, in Asia, we must do what we can to help people who are striving to advance from misery, poverty, and hung er."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must also continue to help the economic growth of our good neighbors in this hemisphere.
1951,Truman,Democratic,These actions will bring greater strength for the free world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They will give many people a real stake in the future and reason to defend their freedom.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They will mean increased production of goods they need and materials we need.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Second, we shall need to continue our military assistance to countries which want to defend themselves."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The heart of our common defense effort is the North Atlantic community.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The defense of Europe is the basis for the defense of the whole free world-ourselves included.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Next to the United States, Europe is the largest workshop in the world."
1951,Truman,Democratic,It is also a ho meland of the great religious beliefs shared by many of our citizens-beliefs which are now threatened by the tide of atheistic communism.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Strategically, economically, and morally, the defense of Europe is a part of our own defense."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"That is why we have joined with the countries of Europe in the North Atlantic Treaty, pledging ourselves to work with them."
1951,Truman,Democratic,There has been much discussion recently over whether the European countries are willing to defend themselves.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Their actions are answering this question.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our North Atlantic Treaty partners have strict systems of universal military training.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Several have recently increased the term of service.
1951,Truman,Democratic,All have taken measures to improve the quality of training.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Forces are being trained and expanded as rapidly as th e necessary arms and equipment can be supplied from their factories and ours.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Our North Atlantic Treaty partners, together, are building armies bigger than our own."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"None of the North Atlantic Treaty countries, including our own country, has done enough yet."
1951,Truman,Democratic,But real progress is being made.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Together, we have worked out defense plans."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The military leaders of our own country took part in working out these plans, and a re agreed that they are sound and within our capabilities."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"To put these plans into action, we sent to Europe last week one of our greatest military commanders, General Dwight D."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Eisenhower.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"General Eisenhower went to Europe to assume command of the united forces of the North Atlantic Treaty countries, including our own forces in Germany."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The people of Europe have confidence in General Eisenhower.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They know his ability to put together a fighting force of allies.
1951,Truman,Democratic,His mission is vital to our security.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We should all stand behind him, and give him every bit of help we can."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Part of our job will be to reinforce the military strength of our European partners by sending them weapons and equipment as our military production expands.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our program of military assistance extends to the nations in the Near East and the Far East which are trying to defend their freedom.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Soviet communism is trying to make these nations into colonies, and to use their people as cannon fodder in new wars of conquest."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We want their people to be free men and to enjoy peace.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our country has always stood for freedom for the peoples of Asia.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Long, long ago it stood for the freedom of the peoples of Asia."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Our history shows this.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have demonstrated it in the Philippines.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We have demonstrated it in our relations with Indonesia, India, and with China."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We hope to join in restoring the people of Japan to membership in the community of free nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"It is in the Far East that we have taken up arms, under the United Nations, to preserve the principle of independence for free nations."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We are fighting to keep the forces of Communist aggression from making a slave state out of Korea.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Korea has tremendous significance for the world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"It means that free nations, acting through the United Nations, are fighting together against aggression."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We will understand the importance of this best if we look back into history.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If the democracies had stood up against the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, or the attack on Ethiopia in 1935, or the seizure of Austria in 1938, if they had stood together again st aggression on those occasions as the United Nations has done in Korea, the whole history of our time would have been different."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The principles for which we are fighting in Korea are right and just.
1951,Truman,Democratic,They are the foundations of collective security and of the future of free nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Korea is not only a country undergoing the torment of aggression; it is also a symbol.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It stands for right and justice in the world against oppression and slavery.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The free world must always stand for these principles-and we will stand with the free world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"As the third part of our program, we will continue to work for peaceful settlements in international disputes."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We will support the United Nations and remain loyal to the great principles of international cooperation laid down in its charter.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are willing, as we have always been, to negotiate honorable settlements with the Soviet Union."
1951,Truman,Democratic,But we will not engage in appeasement.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The Soviet rulers have made it clear that we must have strength as well as right on our side.
1951,Truman,Democratic,If we build our strength-and we are building it-the Soviet rulers may face the facts and lay aside their plans to take over the world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"That is what we hope will happen, and that is what we are trying to bring about."
1951,Truman,Democratic,That is the only realistic road to peace.
1951,Truman,Democratic,These are the main elements of the course our Nation must follow as a member of the community of free nations.
1951,Truman,Democratic,These are the things we must do to preserve our security and help create a peaceful world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,But they will be successful only if we increase the strength of our own country.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Here at home we have some very big jobs to do.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We are building much stronger military forces-and we are building them fast.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are preparing for full wartime mobilization, if that should be necessary."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"And we are continuing to build a strong and growing economy, able to maintain whatever effort may be required for as long as necessary."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are building our own Army, Navy, and Air Force to an active strength of nearly 3 1/2 million men and women."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are stepping up the training of the reserve forces, and establishing more training facilities, so that we can rapidly increase our active fo rces far more on short notice."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We are going to produce all the weapons and equipment that such an armed force will need.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Furthermore, we will make weapons for our allies, and weapons for our own reserve supplies."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"On top of this, we will build the capacity to turn out on short notice arms and supplies that may be needed for a full-scale war."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Fortunately, we have a good start on this because of our enormous plant capacity and because of the equipment on hand from the last war."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"For example, many combat ships are being returned to active duty from the ""mothball fleet"" and many others can be put into service on very short notice."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have large reserves of arms and ammunition and thousands of workers skilled in arms production.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"In many cases, however, our stocks of weapons are low."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"In other cases, those on hand are not the most modern."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have made remarkable technical advances.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have developed new types of jet planes and powerful new tanks.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We are concentrating on producing the newest types of weapons and producing them as fast as we can.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"This production drive is more selective than the one we had during World War II, but it is just as urgent and intense."
1951,Truman,Democratic,It is a big program and it is a costly one.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Let me give you two concrete examples.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Our present program calls for expanding the aircraft industry so that it will have the capacity to produce 50,000 modern military planes a year."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are preparing the capacity to produce 35,000 tanks a year."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are not now ordering that many planes or that many tanks, and we hope that we never have to, but we mean to be able to turn them out if we need them."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The planes we are producing now are much bigger, much better, and much more expensive than the planes we had during the last war."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We used to think that the B-17 was a huge plane, and the blockbuster it carried a huge load."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"But the B-36 can carry five of these blockbusters in its belly, and it can carry them five times as far."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Of course, the B-36 is much more complicated to build than the B-17, and far more expensive."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"One B-17 costs $275,000, while now one B-36 costs 3 million."
1951,Truman,Democratic,I ask you to remember that what we are doing is to provide the best and most modern military equipment in the world for our fighting forces.
1951,Truman,Democratic,This kind of defense production program has two parts.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The first part is to get our defense protect production going as fast as possible.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We have to convert plants and channel materials to defense production.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"This means heavy cuts in civilian uses of copper, aluminum, rubber, and other essential materials."
1951,Truman,Democratic,It means shortages in various consumer goods.
1951,Truman,Democratic,The second part is to increase our capacity to produce and to keep our economy strong for the long pull.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We do not know how long Communist aggression will threaten the world.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Only by increasing our output can we carry the burden of preparedness for an indefinite period in the future.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"This means that we will have to build more power plants and more steel mills, grow more cotton, mine more copper, and expand our capacity in many other ways."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The Congress will need to consider legislation, at this session, affecting all the aspects of our mobilization job."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The main subjects on which legislation will be needed are: First, appropriations for our military buildup."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Second, extension and revision of the Selective Service Act."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Third, military and economic aid to help build up the strength of the free world."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Fourth, revision and extension of the authority to expand production and to stabilize prices, wages, and rents."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Fifth, improvement of our agricultural laws to help obtain the kinds of farm products we need for the defense effort."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Sixth, improvement of our labor laws to help provide stable labor-management relations and to make sure that we have steady production in this emergency."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Seventh, housing and training of defense workers and the full use of all our manpower resources."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Eighth, means for increasing the supply of doctors, nurses, and other trained medical personnel critically needed for the defense effort."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Ninth, aid to the States to meet the most urgent needs of our elementary and secondary schools."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Some of our plans will have to be deferred for the time being.
1951,Truman,Democratic,But we should do all we can to make sure our children are being trained as good and useful citizens in the critical times ahead.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Tenth, a major increase in taxes to meet the cost of the defense effort."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The Economic Report and the Budget Message will discuss these subjects further.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"In addition, I shall send to the Congress special messages containing detailed recommendations on legislation needed at this session."
1951,Truman,Democratic,In the months ahead the Government must give priority to activities that are urgent-like military procurement and atomic energy and power development.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It must practice rigid economy in its non defense activities.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Many of the things we would normally do must be curtailed or postponed.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"But in a long-term defense effort like this one, we cannot neglect the measures needed to maintain a strong economy and a healthy democratic society."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"The Congress, therefore, should give continued attention to the measures which our country will need for the long pull."
1951,Truman,Democratic,And it should act upon such legislation as promptly as circumstances permit.
1951,Truman,Democratic,To take just one example-we need to continue and complete the work of rounding out our system of social insurance.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We still need to improve our protection against unemployment and old age.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We still need to provide insurance against the loss of earnings through sickness, and against the high costs of modern medical care."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"And above all, we must remember that the fundamentals of our strength rest upon the freedoms of our people."
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must continue our efforts to achieve the full realization of our democratic ideals.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must uphold the freedom of speech and the freedom of conscience in our land.
1951,Truman,Democratic,We must assure equal rights and equal opportunities to all our citizens.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"As we go forward this year in the defense of freedom, let us keep clearly before us the nature of our present effort."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We are building up our strength, in concert with other free nations, to meet the danger of aggression that has been turned loose on the world."
1951,Truman,Democratic,The strength of the free nations is the world's best hope of peace.
1951,Truman,Democratic,I ask the Congress for unity in these crucial days.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Make no mistake about my meaning.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"I do not ask, or expect, unanimity."
1951,Truman,Democratic,I do not ask for an end to debate.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Only by debate can we arrive at decisions which are wise, and which reflect the desires of the American people."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We do not have a dictatorship in this country, and we never will have one in this country."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"When I request unity, what I am really asking for is a sense of responsibility on the part of every Member of this Congress."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Let us debate the issues, but let every man among us weigh his words and his deeds."
1951,Truman,Democratic,There is a sharp difference between harmful criticism and constructive criticism.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"If we are truly responsible as individuals, I am sure that we will be unified as a government."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Let us keep our eyes on the issues and work for the things we all believe in.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"Let each of us put our country ahead of our party, and ahead of our own personal interests."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"I had the honor to be a Member of the Senate during World War II, and I know from experience that unity of purpose and of effort is possible in the Congress without any lessening of the vitality of our two party system."
1951,Truman,Democratic,Let us all stand together as Americans.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Let us stand together with all men every where who believe in human liberty.
1951,Truman,Democratic,Peace is precious to us.
1951,Truman,Democratic,It is the way of life we strive for with all the strength and wisdom we possess.
1951,Truman,Democratic,But more precious than peace are freedom and justice.
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We will fight, if fight we must, to keep our freedom and to prevent justice from being destroyed."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"These are the things that give meaning to our lives, and which we acknowledge to be greater than ourselves."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"This is our cause-peace, freedom, justice."
1951,Truman,Democratic,"We will pursue this cause with determination and humility, asking divine guidance that in all we do we may follow the will of God."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION February 2, 1953 Mr."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"President, Mr."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Speaker, Members of the Eighty-third Congress: I welcome the honor of appearing before you to deliver my first message to the Congress."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It is manifestly the joint purpose of the congressional leadership and of this administration to justify the summons to governmental responsibility issued last November by the American people.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The grand labors of this leadership will involve: Application of America's influence in world affairs with such fortitude and such foresight that it will deter aggression and eventually secure peace; Establishment of a national administration of such integrity and such efficiency that its honor at home will ensure respect abroad; Encouragement of those incentives that inspire creative initiative in our economy, so that its productivity may fortify freedom everywhere; and Dedication to the well-being of all our citizens and to the attainment of equality of opportunity for all, so that our Nation will ever act with the strength of unity in every task to which it is called."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The purpose of this message is to suggest certain lines along which our joint efforts may immediately be directed toward realization of these four ruling purposes.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The time that this administration has been in office has been too brief to permit preparation of a detailed and comprehensive program of recommended action to cover all phases of the responsibilities that devolve upon our country's new leaders.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such a program will be filled out in the weeks ahead as, after appropriate study, I shall submit additional recommendations for your consideration."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Today can provide only a sure and substantial beginning.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,II.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Our country has come through a painful period of trial and disillusionment since the victory of 1945.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We anticipated a world of peace and cooperation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The calculated pressures of aggressive communism have forced us, instead, to live in a world of turmoil."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,From this costly experience we have learned one clear lesson.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have learned that the free world cannot indefinitely remain in a posture of paralyzed tension, leaving forever to the aggressor the choice of time and place and means to cause greatest hurt to us at least cost to himself."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This administration has, therefore, begun the definition of a new, positive foreign policy."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This policy will be governed by certain fixed ideas.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"They are these: (1) Our foreign policy must be clear, consistent, and confident."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This means that it must be the product of genuine, continuous cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches of this Government."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It must be developed and directed in the spirit of true bipartisanship. (2) The policy we embrace must be a coherent global policy.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The freedom we cherish and defend in Europe and in the Americas is no different from the freedom that is imperiled in Asia. (3) Our policy, dedicated to making the free world secure, will envision all peaceful methods and devices--except breaking faith with our friends."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall never acquiesce in the enslavement of any people in order to purchase fancied gain for ourselves.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall ask the Congress at a later date to join in an appropriate resolution making clear that this Government recognizes no kind of commitment contained in secret understandings of the past with foreign governments which permit this kind of enslavement. (4) The policy we pursue will recognize the truth that no single country, even one so powerful as ours, can alone defend the liberty of all nations threatened by Communist aggression from without or subversion within."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Mutual security means effective mutual cooperation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"For the United States, this means that, as a matter of common sense and national interest, we shall give help to other nations in the measure that they strive earnestly to do their full share of the common task."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,No wealth of aid could compensate for poverty of spirit.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The heart of every free nation must be honestly dedicated to the preserving of its own independence and security. (5) Our policy will be designed to foster the advent of practical unity in Western Europe.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The nations of that region have contributed notably to the effort of sustaining the security of the free world.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"From the jungles of Indochina and Malaya to the northern shores of Europe, they have vastly improved their defensive strength."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Where called upon to do so, they have made costly and bitter sacrifices to hold the line of freedom."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But the problem of security demands closer cooperation among the nations of Europe than has been known to date.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Only a more closely integrated economic and political system can provide the greatly increased economic strength needed to maintain both necessary military readiness and respectable living standards.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Europe's enlightened leaders have long been aware of these facts.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"All the devoted work that has gone into the Schuman plan, the European Army, and the Strasbourg Conference has testified to their vision and determination."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These achievements are the more remarkable when we realize that each of them has marked a victory--for France and for Germany alike over the divisions that in the past have brought such tragedy to these two great nations and to the world.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The needed unity of Western Europe manifestly cannot be manufactured from without; it can only be created from within.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But it is right and necessary that we encourage Europe's leaders by informing them of the high value we place upon the earnestness of their efforts toward this goal.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Real progress will be conclusive evidence to the American people that our material sacrifices in the cause of collective security are matched by essential political, economic, and military accomplishments in Western Europe. (6) Our foreign policy will recognize the importance of profitable and equitable world trade."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A substantial beginning can and should be made by our friends themselves.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Europe, for example, is now marked by checkered areas of labor surplus and labor shortage, of agricultural areas needing machines and industrial areas needing food."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here and elsewhere we can hope that our friends will take the initiative in creating broader markets and more dependable currencies, to allow greater exchange of goods and services among themselves."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Action along these lines can create an economic environment that will invite vital help from us.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This help includes: First: Revising our customs regulations to remove procedural obstacles to profitable trade.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I further recommend that the Congress take the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate legislation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This objective must not ignore legitimate safeguarding of domestic industries, agriculture, and labor standards."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,In all executive study and recommendations on this problem labor and management and farmers alike will be earnestly consulted.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Second: Doing whatever Government properly can to encourage the flow of private American investment abroad.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This involves, as a serious and explicit purpose of our foreign policy, the encouragement of a hospitable climate for such investment in foreign nations."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Third: Availing ourselves of facilities overseas for the economical production of manufactured articles which are needed for mutual defense and which are not seriously competitive with our own normal peacetime production.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fourth: Receiving from the rest of the world, in equitable exchange for what we supply, greater amounts of important raw materials which we do not ourselves possess in adequate quantities."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,III.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This war is, for Americans, the most painful phase of Communist aggression throughout the world."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is clearly a part of the same calculated assault that the aggressor is simultaneously pressing in Indochina and in Malaya, and of the strategic situation that manifestly embraces the island of Formosa and the Chinese Nationalist forces there."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The working out of any military solution to the Korean war will inevitably affect all these areas.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The administration is giving immediate increased attention to the development of additional Republic of Korea forces.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The citizens of that country have proved their capacity as fighting men and their eagerness to take a greater share in the defense of their homeland.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Organization, equipment, and training will allow them to do so."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Increased assistance to Korea for this purpose conforms fully to our global policies.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In June 1950, following the aggressive attack on the Republic of Korea, the United States Seventh Fleet was instructed both to prevent attack upon Formosa and also to insure that Formosa should not be used as a base of operations against the Chinese Communist mainland."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This has meant, in effect, that the United States Navy was required to serve as a defensive arm of Communist China."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Regardless of the situation in 1950, since the date of that order the Chinese Communists have invaded Korea to attack the United Nations forces there."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,They have consistently rejected the proposals of the United Nations Command for an armistice.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,They recently joined with Soviet Russia in rejecting the armistice proposal sponsored in the United Nations by the Government of India.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This proposal had been accepted by the United States and 53 other nations.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Consequently there is no longer any logic or sense in a condition that required the United States Navy to assume defensive responsibilities on behalf of the Chinese Communists, thus permitting those Communists, with greater impunity, to kill our soldiers and those of our United Nations allies in Korea."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am, therefore, issuing instructions that the Seventh Fleet no longer be employed to shield Communist China."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This order implies no aggressive intent on our part.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But we certainly have no obligation to protect a nation fighting us in Korea.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,IV.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Our labor for peace in Korea and in the world imperatively demands the maintenance by the United States of a strong fighting service ready for any contingency.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Our problem is to achieve adequate military strength within the limits of endurable strain upon our economy.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,To amass military power without regard to our economic capacity would be to defend ourselves against one kind of disaster by inviting another.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Both military and economic objectives demand a single national military policy, proper coordination of our armed services, and effective consolidation of certain logistics activities."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must eliminate waste and duplication of effort in the armed services.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must realize clearly that size alone is not sufficient.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The biggest force is not necessarily the best--and we want the best.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must not let traditions or habits of the past stand in the way of developing an efficient military force.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,All members of our forces must be ever mindful that they serve under a single flag and for a single cause.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must effectively integrate our armament programs and plan them in such careful relation to our industrial facilities that we assure the best use of our manpower and our materials.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because of the complex technical nature of our military organization and because of the security reasons involved, the Secretary of Defense must take the initiative and assume the responsibility for developing plans to give our Nation maximum safety at minimum cost."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Accordingly, the new Secretary of Defense and his civilian and military associates will, in the future, recommend such changes in present laws affecting our defense activities as may be necessary to clarify responsibilities and improve the total effectiveness of our defense effort."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This effort must always conform to policies laid down in the National Security Council.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The statutory function of the National Security Council is to assist the President in the formulation and coordination of significant domestic, foreign, and military policies required for the security of the Nation."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,In these days of tension it is essential that this central body have the vitality to perform effectively its statutory role.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I propose to see that it does so.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Careful formulation of policies must be followed by clear understanding of them by all peoples.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"A related need, therefore, is to make more effective all activities of the Government related to international information."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I have recently appointed a committee of representative and informed citizens to survey this subject and to make recommendations in the near future for legislative, administrative, or other action."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A unified and dynamic effort in this whole field is essential to the security of the United States and of the other peoples in the community of free nations.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,There is but one sure way to avoid total war--and that is to win the cold war.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"While retaliatory power is one strong deterrent to a would-be aggressor, another powerful deterrent is defensive power."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,No enemy is likely to attempt an attack foredoomed to failure.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because the building of a completely impenetrable defense against attack is still not possible, total defensive strength must include civil defense preparedness."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because we have incontrovertible evidence that Soviet Russia possesses atomic weapons, this kind of protection becomes sheer necessity."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Civil defense responsibilities primarily belong to the State and local governments--recruiting, training, and organizing volunteers to meet any emergency."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The immediate job of the Federal Government is to provide leadership, to supply technical guidance, and to continue to strengthen its civil defense stockpile of medical, engineering, and related supplies and equipment."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This work must go forward without lag.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,V.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I have referred to the inescapable need for economic health and strength if we are to maintain adequate military power and exert influential leadership for peace in the world.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our immediate task is to chart a fiscal and economic policy that can: (1) Reduce the planned deficits and then balance the budget, which means, among other things, reducing Federal expenditures to the safe minimum; (2) Meet the huge costs of our defense; (3) Properly handle the burden of our inheritance of debt and obligations; (4) Check the menace of inflation; (5) Work toward the earliest possible reduction of the tax burden; (6) Make constructive plans to encourage the initiative of our citizens."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It is important that all of us understand that this administration does not and cannot begin its task with a clean slate.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Much already has been written on the record, beyond our power quickly to erase or to amend."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This record includes our inherited burden of indebtedness and obligations and deficits.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The current year's budget, as you know, carries a 5.9 billion dollar deficit; and the budget, which was presented to you before this administration took office, indicates a budgetary deficit of 9.9 billion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1954."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The national debt is now more than 265 billion dollars.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In addition, the accumulated obligational authority of the Federal Government for future payment totals over 80 billion dollars."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Even this amount is exclusive of large contingent liabilities, so numerous and extensive as to be almost beyond description."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The bills for the payment of nearly all of the 80 billion dollars of obligations will be presented during the next 4 years.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"These bills, added to the current costs of government we must meet, make a formidable burden."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The present authorized Government-debt limit is 275 billion dollars.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The forecast presented by the outgoing administration with the fiscal year 1954 budget indicates that--before the end of the fiscal year and at the peak of demand for payments during the year--the total Government debt may approach and even exceed that limit.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Unless budgeted deficits are checked, the momentum of past programs will force an increase of the statutory debt limit."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Permit me this one understatement: to meet and to correct this situation will not be easy.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Permit me this one assurance: every department head and I are determined to do everything we can to resolve it.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The first order of business is the elimination of the annual deficit.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This cannot be achieved merely by exhortation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It demands the concerted action of all those in responsible positions in the Government and the earnest cooperation of the Congress.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Already, we have begun an examination of the appropriations and expenditures of all departments in an effort to find significant items that may be decreased or canceled without damage to our essential requirements."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Getting control of the budget requires also that State and local governments and interested groups of citizens restrain themselves in their demands upon the Congress that the Federal Treasury spend more and more money for all types of projects.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A balanced budget is an essential first measure in checking further depreciation in the buying power of the dollar.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This is one of the critical steps to be taken to bring an end to planned inflation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Our purpose is to manage the Government's finances so as to help and not hinder each family in balancing its own budget.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Reduction of taxes will be justified only as we show we can succeed in bringing the budget under control.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"As the budget is balanced and inflation checked, the tax burden that today stifles initiative can and must be eased."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Until we can determine the extent to which expenditures can be reduced, it would not be wise to reduce our revenues."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Meanwhile, the tax structure as a whole demands review."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The Secretary of the Treasury is undertaking this study immediately.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must develop a system of taxation which will impose the least possible obstacle to the dynamic growth of the country.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This includes particularly real opportunity for the growth of small businesses.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Many readjustments in existing taxes will be necessary to serve these objectives and also to remove existing inequities.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Clarification and simplification in the tax laws as well as the regulations will be undertaken.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the entire area of fiscal policy--which must, in its various aspects, be treated in recommendations to the Congress in coming weeks--there can now be stated certain basic facts and principles."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,First.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It is axiomatic that our economy is a highly complex and sensitive mechanism.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Hasty and ill-considered action of any kind could seriously upset the subtle equation that encompasses debts, obligations, expenditures, defense demands, deficits, taxes, and the general economic health of the Nation."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our goals can be clear, our start toward them can be immediate--but action must be gradual."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Second.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It is clear that too great a part of the national debt comes due in too short a time.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The Department of the Treasury will undertake at suitable times a program of extending part of the debt over longer periods and gradually placing greater amounts in the hands of longer-term investors.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Third.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Past differences in policy between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board have helped to encourage inflation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Henceforth, I expect that their single purpose shall be to serve the whole Nation by policies designed to stabilize the economy and encourage the free play of our people's genius for individual initiative."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In encouraging this initiative, no single item in our current problems has received more thoughtful consideration by my associates, and by the many individuals called into our counsels, than the matter of price and wage control by law."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The great economic strength of our democracy has developed in an atmosphere of freedom.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The character of our people resists artificial and arbitrary controls of any kind.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Direct controls, except those on credit, deal not with the real causes of inflation but only with its symptoms."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In times of national emergency, this kind of control has a role to play."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our whole system, however, is based upon the assumption that, normally, we should combat wide fluctuations in our price structure by relying largely on the effective use of sound fiscal and monetary policy, and upon the natural workings of economic law."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, American labor and American business can best resolve their wage problems across the bargaining table."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Government should refrain from sitting in with them unless, in extreme cases, the public welfare requires protection."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We are, of course, living in an international situation that is neither an emergency demanding full mobilization, nor is it peace."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,No one can know how long this condition will persist.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Consequently, we are forced to learn many new things as we go along-clinging to what works, discarding what does not."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In all our current discussions on these and related facts, the weight of evidence is clearly against the use of controls in their present forms."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,They have proved largely unsatisfactory or unworkable.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,They have not prevented inflation; they have not kept down the cost of living.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Dissatisfaction with them is wholly justified.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am convinced that now--as well as in the long run--free and competitive prices will best serve the interests of all the people, and best meet the changing, growing needs of our economy."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Accordingly, I do not intend to ask for a renewal of the present wage and price controls on April 30, 1953, when present legislation expires."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the meantime, steps will be taken to eliminate controls in an orderly manner, and to terminate special agencies no longer needed for this purpose."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is obviously to be expected that the removal of these controls will result in individual price changes--some up, some down."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But a maximum of freedom in market prices as well as in collective bargaining is characteristic of a truly free people.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I believe also that material and product controls should be ended, except with respect to defense priorities and scarce and critical items essential for our defense."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall recommend to the Congress that legislation be enacted to continue authority for such remaining controls of this type as will be necessary after the expiration of the existing statute on June 30, 1953."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I recommend the continuance of the authority for Federal control over rents in those communities in which serious housing shortages exist.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These are chiefly the so-called defense areas.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,In these and all areas the Federal Government should withdraw from the control of rents as soon as practicable.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"But before they are removed entirely, each legislature should have full opportunity to take over, within its own State, responsibility for this function."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It would be idle to pretend that all our problems in this whole field of prices will solve themselves by mere Federal withdrawal from direct controls.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall have to watch trends closely.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"If the freer functioning of our economic system, as well as the indirect controls which can be appropriately employed, prove insufficient during this period of strain and tension, I shall promptly ask the Congress to enact such legislation as may be required."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In facing all these problems--wages, prices, production, tax rates, fiscal policy, deficits--everywhere we remain constantly mindful that the time for sacrifice has not ended."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But we are concerned with the encouragement of competitive enterprise and individual initiative precisely because we know them to be our Nation's abiding sources of strength.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,VI.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our vast world responsibility accents with urgency our people's elemental right to a government whose clear qualities are loyalty, security, efficiency, economy, and integrity."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The safety of America and the trust of the people alike demand that the personnel of the Federal Government be loyal in their motives and reliable in the discharge of their duties.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Only a combination of both loyalty and reliability promises genuine security.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,To state this principle is easy; to apply it can be difficult.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But this security we must and shall have.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"By way of example, all principal new appointees to departments and agencies have been investigated at their own request by the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Confident of your understanding and cooperation, I know that the primary responsibility for keeping out the disloyal and the dangerous rests squarely upon the executive branch."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"When this branch so conducts itself as to require policing by another branch of the Government, it invites its own disorder and confusion."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I am determined to meet this responsibility of the Executive.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The heads of all executive departments and agencies have been instructed to initiate at once effective programs of security with respect to their personnel.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Attorney General will advise and guide the departments and agencies in the shaping of these programs, designed at once to govern the employment of new personnel and to review speedily any derogatory information concerning incumbent personnel."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"To carry out these programs, I believe that the powers of the executive branch under existing law are sufficient."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"If they should prove inadequate, the necessary legislation will be requested."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These programs will be both fair to the rights of the individual and effective for the safety of the Nation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"They will, with care and justice, apply the basic principle that public employment is not a right but a privilege."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,All these measures have two clear purposes: Their first purpose is to make certain that this Nation's security is not jeopardized by false servants.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Their second purpose is to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned suspicion that accepts rumor and gossip as substitutes for evidence.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our people, of course, deserve and demand of their Federal Government more than security of personnel."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"They demand, also, efficient and logical organization, true to constitutional principles."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I have already established a Committee on Government Organization.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The Committee is using as its point of departure the reports of the Hoover Commission and subsequent studies by several independent agencies.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"To achieve the greater efficiency and economy which the Committee analyses show to be possible, I ask the Congress to extend the present Government Reorganization Act for a period of 18 months or 2 years beyond its expiration date of April 1, 1953."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,There is more involved here than realigning the wheels and smoothing the gears of administrative machinery.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The Congress rightfully-expects the Executive to take the initiative in discovering and removing outmoded functions and eliminating duplication.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"One agency, for example, whose head has promised early and vigorous action to provide greater efficiency is the Post Office."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"One of the oldest institutions of our Federal Government, its service should be of the best."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Its employees should merit and receive the high regard and esteem of the citizens of the Nation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"There are today in some areas of the postal service, both waste and incompetence to be corrected."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"With the cooperation of the Congress, and taking advantage of its accumulated experience in postal affairs, the Postmaster General will institute a program directed at improving service while at the same time reducing costs and decreasing deficits."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In all departments, dedication to these basic precepts of security and efficiency, integrity, and economy can and will produce an administration deserving of the trust the people have placed in it."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our people have demanded nothing less than good, efficient government."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,They shall get nothing less.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,VII.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Vitally important are the water and minerals, public lands and standing timber, forage and Mid-life of this country."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A fast-growing population will have vast future needs in these resources.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must more than match the substantial achievements in the half-century since President Theodore Roosevelt awakened the Nation to the problem of conservation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This calls for a strong Federal program in the field of resource development.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Its major projects should be timed, where possible to assist in leveling off peaks and valleys in our economic life."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Soundly planned projects already initiated should be carried out.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,New ones will be planned for the future.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The best natural resources program for America will not result from exclusive dependence on Federal bureaucracy.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It will involve a partnership of the States and local communities, private citizens, and the Federal Government, all working together."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This combined effort will advance the development of the great river valleys of our Nation and the power that they can generate.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Likewise, such a partnership can be effective in the expansion throughout the Nation of upstream storage; the sound use of public lands; the wise conservation of minerals; and the sustained yield of our forests."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"There has been much criticism, some of it apparently justified, of the confusion resulting from overlapping Federal activities in the entire field of resource-conservation."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This matter is being exhaustively studied and appropriate reorganization plans will be developed.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Most of these particular resource problems pertain to the Department of the Interior.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Another of its major concerns is our country's island possessions.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here, one matter deserves attention."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The platforms of both political parties promised immediate statehood to Hawaii.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The people of that Territory have earned that status.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Statehood should be granted promptly with the first election scheduled for 1954.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,VIII.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"One of the difficult problems which face the new administration is that of the slow, irregular decline of farm prices."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This decline, which has been going on for almost 2 years, has occurred at a time when most nonfarm prices and farm costs of production are extraordinarily high."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Present agricultural legislation provides for the mandatory support of the prices of basic farm commodities at 90 percent of parity.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Secretary of Agriculture and his associates will, of course, execute the present act faithfully and thereby seek to mitigate the consequences of the downturn in farm income."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This price-support legislation will expire at the end of 1954.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,So we should begin now to consider what farm legislation we should develop for 1955 and beyond.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Our aim should be economic stability and full parity of income for American farmers.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"But we must seek this goal in ways that minimize governmental interference in the farmers' affairs, that permit desirable shifts in production, and that encourage farmers themselves to use initiative in meeting changing economic conditions."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A continuing study reveals nothing more emphatically than the complicated nature of this subject.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Among other things, it shows that the prosperity of our agriculture depends directly upon the prosperity of the whole country--upon the purchasing power of American consumers."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It depends also upon the opportunity to ship abroad large surpluses of particular commodities, and therefore upon sound economic relationships between the United States and many foreign countries."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It involves research and scientific investigation, conducted on an extensive scale."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It involves special credit mechanisms and marketing, rural electrification, soil conservation, and other programs."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The whole complex of agricultural programs and policies will be studied by a Special Agricultural Advisory Commission, as I know it will by appropriate committees of the Congress."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A nonpartisan group of respected authorities in the field of agriculture has already been appointed as an interim advisory group.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The immediate changes needed in agricultural programs are largely budgetary and administrative in nature.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,New policies and new programs must await the completion of the far-reaching studies which have already been launched.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,IX.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The determination of labor policy must be governed not by the vagaries of political expediency but by the firmest principles and convictions.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Slanted partisan appeals to American workers, spoken as if they were a group apart, necessitating a special language and treatment, are an affront to the fullness of their dignity as American citizens."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The truth in matters of labor policy has become obscured in controversy.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The very meaning of economic freedom as it affects labor has become confused.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This misunderstanding has provided a climate of opinion favoring the growth of governmental paternalism in labor relations.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This tendency, if left uncorrected, could end only by producing a bureaucratic despotism."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Economic freedom is, in fact, the requisite of greater prosperity for every American who earns his own living."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the field of labor legislation, only a law that merits the respect and support of both labor and management can help reduce the loss of wages and of production through strikes and stoppages, and thus add to the total economic strength of our Nation."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have now had 5 years' experience with the Labor Management Act of 1947, commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"That experience has shown the need for some corrective action, and we should promptly proceed to amend that act."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I know that the Congress is already proceeding with renewed studies of this subject.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Meanwhile, the Department of Labor is at once beginning work to devise further specific recommendations for your consideration."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the careful working out of legislation, I know you will give thoughtful consideration--as will we in the executive branch--to the views of labor, and of management, and of the general public."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this process, it is only human that each of us should bring forward the arguments of self-interest."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,But if all conduct their arguments in the overpowering light of national interest--which is enlightened self-interest--we shall get the right answers.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I profoundly hope that every citizen of our country will follow with understanding your progress in this work.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The welfare of all of us is involved.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Especially must we remember that the institutions of trade unionism and collective bargaining are monuments to the freedom that must prevail in our industrial life.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,They have a century of honorable achievement behind them.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our faith in them is proven, firm, and final."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Government can do a great deal to aid the settlement of labor disputes without allowing itself to be employed as an ally of either side.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Its proper role in industrial strife is to encourage the processes of mediation and conciliation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These processes can successfully be directed only by a government free from the taint of any suspicion that it is partial or punitive.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The administration intends to strengthen and to improve the services which the Department of Labor can render to the worker and to the whole national community.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This Department was created--just 40 years ago--to serve the entire Nation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It must aid, for example, employers and employees alike in improving training programs that will develop skilled and competent workers."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It must enjoy the confidence and respect of labor and industry in order to play a significant role in the planning of America's economic future.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"To that end, I am authorizing the Department of Labor to establish promptly a tripartite advisory committee consisting of representatives of employers, labor, and the public."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,X.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Our civil and social rights form a central part of the heritage we are striving to defend on all fronts and with all our strength.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I believe with all my heart that our vigilant guarding of these rights is a sacred obligation binding upon every citizen.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"To be true to one's own freedom is, in essence, to honor and respect the freedom of all others."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,A cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish is the equality of rights of all citizens of every race and color and creed.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We know that discrimination against minorities persists despite our allegiance to this ideal.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Such discrimination--confined to no one section of the Nation--is but the outward testimony to the persistence of distrust and of fear in the hearts of men.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This fact makes all the more vital the fighting of these wrongs by each individual, in every station of life, in his every deed."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Much of the answer lies in the power of fact, fully publicized; of persuasion, honestly pressed; and of conscience, justly aroused."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"These are methods familiar to our way of life, tested and proven wise."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here in the District of Columbia, serious attention should be given to the proposal to develop and authorize, through legislation, a system to provide an effective voice in local self-government."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"While consideration of this proceeds, I recommend an immediate increase of two in the number of District Commissioners to broaden representation of all elements of our local population."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This will be a first step toward insuring that this Capital provide an honored example to all communities of our Nation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this manner, and by the leadership of the office of the President exercised through friendly conferences with those in authority in our States and cities, we expect to make true and rapid progress in civil rights and equality of employment opportunity."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,There is one sphere in which civil rights are inevitably involved in Federal legislation.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This is the sphere of immigration.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It is a manifest right of our Government to limit the number of immigrants our Nation can absorb.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,It is also a manifest right of our Government to set reasonable requirements on the character and the numbers of the people who come to share our land and our freedom.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is well for us, however, to remind ourselves occasionally of an equally manifest fact: we are--one and all--immigrants or sons and daughters of immigrants."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Existing legislation contains injustices.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"It does, in fact, discriminate."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am informed by Members of the Congress that it was realized, at the time of its enactment, that future study of the basis of determining quotas would be necessary."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I am therefore requesting the Congress to review this legislation and to enact a statute that will at one and the same time guard our legitimate national interests and be faithful to our basic ideas of freedom and fairness to all.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,In another but related area--that of social rights--we see most clearly the new application of old ideas of freedom.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This administration is profoundly aware of two great needs born of our living in a complex industrial economy.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, the individual citizen must have safeguards against personal disaster inflicted by forces beyond his control; second, the welfare of the people demands effective and economical performance by the Government of certain indispensable social services."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the light of this responsibility, certain general purposes and certain concrete measures are plainly indicated now."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"There is urgent need for greater effectiveness in our programs, both public and private, offering safeguards against the privations that too often come with unemployment, old age, illness, and accident."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The provisions of the old-age and survivors insurance law should promptly be extended to cover millions of citizens who have been left out of the social-security system.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,No less important is the encouragement of privately sponsored pension plans.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Most important of all, of course, is renewed effort to check the inflation which destroys so much of the value of all social-security payments."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our school system demands some prompt, effective help."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"During each of the last 9 years, more than 1 2 million children have swelled the elementary and secondary school population of the country."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"Generally, the school population is proportionately higher in States with low per capita income."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This whole situation calls for careful congressional study and action.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I am sure that you share my conviction that the firm conditions of Federal aid must be proved need and proved lack of local income.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,One phase of the school problem demands special action.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The school population of many districts has been greatly in- creased by the swift growth of defense activities.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These activities have added little or nothing to the tax resources of the communities affected.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislation aiding construction of schools in the districts expires on June 30.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"This law should be renewed; and likewise, the partial payments for current operating expenses for these particular school districts should be made, including the deficiency requirement of the current fiscal year."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Public interest similarly demands one prompt specific action in protection of the general consumer.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The Food and Drug Administration should be authorized to continue its established and necessary program of factory inspections.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The invalidation of these inspections by the Supreme Court of December 8, 1952, was based solely on the fact that the present law contained inconsistent and unclear provisions."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These must be promptly corrected.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I am well aware that beyond these few immediate measures there remains much to be done.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,The health and housing needs of our people call for intelligently planned programs.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Involved are the solvency of the whole security system; and its guarding against exploitation by the irresponsible.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"To bring clear purpose and orderly procedure into this field, I anticipate a thorough study of the proper relationship among Federal, State, and local programs."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall shortly send you specific recommendations for establishing such an appropriate commission, together with a reorganization plan defining new administrative status for all Federal activities in health, education, and social security."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,I repeat that there are many important subjects of which I make no mention today.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Among these is our great and growing body of veterans.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,America has traditionally been generous in caring for the disabled--and the widow and the orphan of the fallen.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,These millions remain close to all our hearts.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,Proper care of our uniformed citizens and appreciation of the past service of our veterans are part of our accepted governmental responsibilities.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We have surveyed briefly some problems of our people and a portion of the tasks before us.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"The hope of freedom itself depends, in real measure, upon our strength, our heart, and our wisdom."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must be strong in arms.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must be strong in the source of all our armament, our productivity."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We all--workers and farmers, foremen and financiers, technicians and builders--all must produce, produce more, and produce yet more."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must be strong, above all, in the spiritual resources upon which all else depends."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must be devoted with all our heart to the values we defend.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,We must know that each of these values and virtues applies with equal force at the ends of the earth and in our relations with our neighbor next door.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must know that freedom expresses itself with equal eloquence in the right of workers to strike in the nearby factory, and in the yearnings and sufferings of the peoples of Eastern Europe."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"As our heart summons our strength, our wisdom must direct it."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"There is, in world affairs, a steady course to be followed between an assertion of strength that is truculent and a confession of helplessness that is cowardly."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"There is, in our affairs at home, a middle way between untrammeled freedom of the individual and the demands for the welfare of the whole Nation."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,This way must avoid government by bureaucracy as carefully as it avoids neglect of the helpless.
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In every area of political action, free men must think before they can expect to win."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this spirit must we live and labor: confident of our strength, compassionate in our heart, clear in our mind."
1953,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this spirit, let us together turn to the great tasks before us."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 7, 1954 Mr."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"President, Mr."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Speaker, Members of the Eighty-third Congress: It is a high honor again to present to the Congress my views on the state of the Union and to recommend measures to advance the security, prosperity, and well-being of the American people."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"All branches of this Government--and I venture to say both of our great parties--can support the general objective of the recommendations (Pg. 7) I make today, for that objective is the building of a stronger America."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,A nation whose every citizen has good reason for bold hope; where effort is rewarded and prosperity is shared; where freedom expands and peace is secure--that is what I mean by a stronger America.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Toward this objective a real momentum has been developed during this Administration's first year in office.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We mean to continue that momentum and to increase it.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We mean to build a better future for this nation.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Much for which we may be thankful has happened during the past year.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,First of all we are deeply grateful that our sons no longer die on the distant mountains of Korea.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Although they are still called from our homes to military service, they are no longer called to the field of battle."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The nation has just completed the most prosperous year in its history.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The damaging effect of inflation on the wages, pensions, salaries and savings of us all has been brought under control."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Taxes have begun to go down.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The cost of our government has been reduced and its work proceeds with some 183,000 fewer employees; thus the discouraging trend of modern governments toward their own limitless expansion has in our case been reversed."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The cost of armaments becomes less oppressive as we near our defense goals; yet we are militarily stronger every day.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the year, creation of the new Cabinet Department of Health, Education, and Welfare symbolized the government's permanent concern with the human problems of our citizens."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Segregation in the armed forces and other Federal activities is on the way out.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We have also made progress toward its elimination in the District of Columbia.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,These are steps in the continuing effort to eliminate inter-racial difficulty.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Some developments beyond our shores have been equally encouraging.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Communist aggression, halted in Korea, continues to meet in Indo-china the vigorous resistance of France and the Associated States, assisted by timely aid from our country."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In West Germany, in Iran, and in other areas of the world, heartening political victories have been won by the forces of stability and freedom."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Slowly but surely, the free world gathers strength."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Meanwhile, from behind the iron curtain, there are signs that tyranny is in trouble and reminders that its structure is as brittle as its surface is hard."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,There has been in fact a great strategic change in the world during the past year.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"That precious intangible, the initiative, is becoming ours."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our policy, not limited to mere reaction against crises provoked by others, is free to develop along lines of our choice not only abroad, but also at home."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a major theme for American policy during the coming year, let our joint determination be to hold this new initiative and to use it."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall use this initiative to promote three broad purposes: First, to protect the freedom of our people; second, to maintain a strong, growing economy; third, to concern ourselves with the human problems of the individual citizen."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Only by active concern for each of these purposes can we be sure that we are on the forward road to a better and a stronger America.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,All my recommendations today are in furtherance of these three purposes.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"FOREIGN AFFAIRS American freedom is threatened so long as the world Communist conspiracy exists in its present scope, power and hostility."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"More closely than ever before, American freedom is interlocked with the freedom of other people."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In the unity of the free world lies our best chance to reduce the Communist threat without war.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the task of maintaining this unity and strengthening all its parts, the greatest responsibility falls naturally on those who, like ourselves, retain the most freedom and strength."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall, therefore, continue to advance the cause of freedom on foreign fronts."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the Far East, we retain our vital interest in Korea."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have negotiated with the Republic of Korea a mutual security pact, which develops our security system for the Pacific and which I shall promptly submit to the Senate for its consent to ratification."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We are prepared to meet any renewal of armed aggression in Korea.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall maintain indefinitely our bases in Okinawa.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall ask the Congress to authorize continued material assistance to hasten the successful conclusion of the struggle in Indo-china.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This assistance will also bring closer the day when the Associated States may enjoy the independence already assured by France.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall also continue military and economic aid to the Nationalist Government of China.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In South Asia, profound changes are taking place in free nations which are demonstrating their ability to progress through democratic (Pg. 9) methods."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,They provide an inspiring contrast to the dictatorial methods and backward course of events in Communist China.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In these continuing efforts, the free peoples of South Asia can be assured of the support of the United States."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the Middle East, where tensions and serious problems exist, we will show sympathetic and impartial friendship."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In Western Europe our policy rests firmly on the North Atlantic Treaty.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It will remain so based as far ahead as we can see.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Within its organization, the building of a united European community, including France and Germany, is vital to a free and self-reliant Europe."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This will be promoted by the European Defense Community which offers assurance of European security.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"With the coming of unity to Western Europe, the assistance this Nation can render for the security of Europe and the free world will be multiplied in effectiveness."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In the Western Hemisphere we shall continue to develop harmonious and mutually beneficial cooperation with our neighbors.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Indeed, solid friendship with all our American neighbors is a cornerstone of our entire policy."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the world as a whole, the United Nations, admittedly still in a state of evolution, means much to the United States."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It has given uniquely valuable services in many places where violence threatened.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It is the only real world forum where we have the opportunity for international presentation and rebuttal.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is a place where the nations of the world can, if they have the will, take collective action for peace and justice."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It is a place where the guilt can be squarely assigned to those who fail to take all necessary steps to keep the peace.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The United Nations deserves our continued firm support.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the practical application of our foreign policy, we enter the field of foreign assistance and trade."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Military assistance must be continued.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Technical assistance must be maintained.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Economic assistance can be reduced.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, our economic programs in Korea and in a few other critical places of the world are especially important, and I shall ask Congress to continue them in the next fiscal year."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The forthcoming Budget Message will propose maintenance of the Presidential power of transferability of all assistance funds and will ask (Pg. 10) authority to merge these funds with the regular defense funds.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It will also propose that the Secretary of Defense have primary responsibility for the administration of foreign military assistance in accordance with the policy guidance of the Secretary of State.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The fact that we can now reduce our foreign economic assistance in many areas is gratifying evidence that its objectives are being achieved.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"By continuing to surpass her prewar levels of economic activity, Western Europe gains self-reliance."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thus our relationship enters a new phase which can bring results beneficial to our taxpayers and our allies alike, if still another step is taken."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This step is the creation of a healthier and freer system of trade and payments within the free world--a system in which our allies can earn their own way and our own economy can continue to flourish.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The free world can no longer afford the kinds of arbitrary restraints on trade that have continued ever since the war.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"On this problem I shall submit to the Congress detailed recommendations, after our Joint Commission on Foreign Economic Policy has made its report."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"ATOMIC ENERGY PROPOSAL As we maintain our military strength during the coming year and draw closer the bonds with our allies, we shall be in an improved position to discuss outstanding issues with the Soviet Union."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Indeed we shall be glad to do so whenever there is a reasonable prospect of constructive results.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In this spirit the atomic energy proposals of the United States were recently presented to the United Nations General Assembly.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"A truly constructive Soviet reaction will make possible a new start toward an era of peace, and away from the fatal road toward atomic war."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"DEFENSE Since our hope is peace, we owe ourselves and the world a candid explanation of the military measures we are taking to make that peace secure."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"As we enter this new year, our military power continues to grow."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This power is for our own defense and to deter aggression.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall not be aggressors, but we and our allies have and will maintain a massive capability to strike back."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here are some of the considerations in our defense planning: First, while determined to use atomic power to serve the usages of peace, we take into full account our great and growing number of nuclear weapons and the most effective means of using them against an aggressor if they are needed to preserve our freedom."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our defense will be stronger if, under appropriate security safeguards, we share with our allies certain knowledge of the tactical use of our nuclear weapons."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge the Congress to provide the needed authority.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, the usefulness of these new weapons creates new relationships between men and materials."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,These new relationships permit economies in the use of men as we build forces suited to our situation in the world today.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"As will be seen from the Budget Message on January 21, the airpower of our Navy and Air Force is receiving heavy emphasis."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, our armed forces must regain maximum mobility of action."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Our strategic reserves must be centrally placed and readily deployable to meet sudden aggression against ourselves and our allies.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fourth, our defense must rest on trained manpower and its most economical and mobile use."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,A professional corps is the heart of any security organization.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It is necessarily the teacher and leader of those who serve temporarily in the discharge of the obligation to help defend the Republic.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Pay alone will not retain in the career service of our armed forces the necessary numbers of long-term personnel.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"I strongly urge, therefore, a more generous use of other benefits important to service morale."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Among these are more adequate living quarters and family housing units and medical care for dependents.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Studies of military manpower have just been completed by the National Security Training Commission and a Committee appointed by the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Evident weaknesses exist in the state of readiness and organization of our reserve forces.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Measures to correct these weaknesses will be later submitted to the Congress.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fifth, the ability to convert swiftly from partial to all-out mobilization is imperative to our security."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"For the first time, mobilization officials know what the requirements are for 1,000 major items needed for military uses."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"These data, now being related to civilian requirements and our supply potential, will show us the gaps in our mobilization base."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Thus we shall have more realistic plant-expansion and stockpiling goals.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall speed their attainment.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This Nation is at last to have an up-to-date mobilization base--the foundation of a sound defense program.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Another part of this foundation is, of course, our continental transport system."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Some of our vital heavy materials come increasingly from (Pg. 12) Canada.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Indeed our relations with Canada, happily always close, involve more and more the unbreakable ties of strategic interdependence."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Both nations now need the St.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Lawrence Seaway for security as well as for economic reasons.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge the Congress promptly to approve our participation in its construction.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Sixth, military and non-military measures for continental defense must be and are being strengthened."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the current fiscal year we are allocating to these purposes an increasing portion of our effort, and in the next fiscal year we shall spend nearly a billion dollars more for them than in 1953."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,An indispensable part of our continental security is our civil defense effort.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This will succeed only as we have the complete cooperation of State Governors, Mayors, and voluntary citizen groups."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"With their help we can advance a cooperative program which, if an attack should come, would save many lives and lessen destruction."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The defense program recommended in the 1955 Budget is consistent with all of the considerations which I have just discussed.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It is based on a new military program unanimously recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and approved by me following consideration by the National Security Council.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This new program will make and keep America strong in an age of peril.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Nothing should bar its attainment.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The international and defense policies which I have outlined will enable us to negotiate from a position of strength as we hold our resolute course toward a peaceful world.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"We now turn to matters which are normally characterized as domestic, well realizing that what we do abroad affects every problem at home--from the amount of taxes to our very state of mind."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"INTERNAL SECURITY Under the standards established for the new employee security program, more than 2,200 employees have been separated from the Federal government."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Our national security demands that the investigation of new employees and the evaluation of derogatory information respecting present employees be expedited and concluded at the earliest possible date.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall recommend that the Congress provide additional funds where necessary to speed these important procedures.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,From the special employment standards of the Federal government I turn now to a matter relating to American citizenship.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The subversive character of the Communist Party in the United States has been clearly demonstrated in many ways, including court proceedings."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We should recognize by law a fact that is plain to all thoughtful citizens-that we are dealing here with actions akin to treason--that when a citizen knowingly participates in the Communist conspiracy he no longer holds allegiance to the United States.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"I recommend that Congress enact legislation to provide that a citizen of the United States who is convicted in the courts of hereafter conspiring to advocate the overthrow of this government by force or violence be treated as having, by such act, renounced his allegiance to the United States and forfeited his United States citizenship."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In addition, the Attorney General will soon appear before your Committees to present his recommendations for needed additional legal weapons with which to combat subversion in our country and to deal with the question of claimed immunity."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,II.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"STRONG ECONOMY I turn now to the second great purpose of our government: Along with the protection of freedom, the maintenance of a strong and growing economy."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The American economy is one of the wonders of the world.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"It undergirds our international position, our military security, and the standard of living of every citizen."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This Administration is determined to keep our economy strong and to keep it growing.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,At this moment we are in transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I am confident that we can complete this transition without serious interruption in our economic growth.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,But we shall not leave this vital matter to chance.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Economic preparedness is fully as important to the nation as military preparedness.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Subsequent special messages and the economic report on January 28 will set forth plans of the Administration and its recommendations for Congressional action.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"These will include flexible credit and debt management policies; tax measures to stimulate consumer and business spending; suitable lending, guaranteeing, insuring, and grant-in-aid activities; strengthened old-age and unemployment insurance measures; improved agricultural programs; public-works plans laid well in advance; enlarged opportunities for international trade and investment."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This mere enumeration (Pg. 14) of these subjects implies the vast amount of study, coordination, and planning, to say nothing of authorizing legislation, that altogether make our economic preparedness complete."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"If new conditions arise that require additional administrative or legislative action, the Administration will still be ready."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"A government always ready, as this is, to take well-timed and vigorous action, and a business community willing, as ours is, to plan ,boldly and with confidence, can between them develop a climate assuring steady economic growth."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"THE BUDGET I shall submit to the Congress on January 21 the first budget prepared by this Administration, for the period July 1, 1954, through June 1955."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This budget is adequate to the current needs of the government.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It recognizes that a Federal budget should be a stabilizing factor in the economy.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Its tax and expenditure programs will foster individual initiative and economic growth.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Pending the transmittal of my Budget Message, I shall mention here only a few points about our budgetary situation."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, one of our initial acts was to revise, with the cooperation of the Congress, the Budget prepared before this Administration took office."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Requests for new appropriations were greatly reduced.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In addition, the spending level provided in that Budget for the current fiscal year has been reduced by about $7,000,000,000."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the next fiscal year we estimate a further reduction in expenditures of more than $5,000,000,000."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This will reduce the spending level over the two fiscal years by more than $12,000,000,000."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We are also reducing further our requests for new appropriations.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, despite the substantial loss of revenue in the coming fiscal year, resulting from tax reductions now in effect and tax adjustments which I shall propose, our reduced spending will move the new budget closer to a balance."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, by keeping new appropriation requests below estimated revenues, we continue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligations incurred by the Government under past appropriations."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fourth, until those claims on our Government's revenues are further reduced, the growth in the public debt cannot be entirely stopped."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because of this--because the government's bills have to be paid every (Pg. 15) month, while the tax money to pay them comes in with great unevenness within the fiscal year--and because of the need for flexibility to manage this enormous debt, I find it necessary to renew my request for an increase in the statutory debt limit."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,TAXES The new budget provides for a lower level of taxation than has prevailed in preceding years.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Six days ago individual income taxes were reduced and the excess profits tax expired.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,These tax reductions are justified only because of the substantial reductions we already have made and are making in governmental expenditures.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"As additional reductions in expenditures are brought gradually but surely into sight, further reductions in taxes can and will be made."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"When budget savings and sound governmental financing are assured, tax burdens should be reduced so that taxpayers may spend their own money in their own way."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,While we are moving toward lower levels of taxation we must thoroughly revise our whole tax system.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The groundwork for this revision has already been laid by the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, in close consultation with the Department of the Treasury."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"We should now remove the more glaring tax inequities, particularly on small taxpayers; reduce restraints on the growth of small business; and make other changes that will encourage initiative, enterprise and production."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Twenty-five recommendations toward these ends will be contained in my budget message.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Without attempting to summarize these manifold reforms, I can here illustrate their tendency."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"For example, we propose more liberal tax treatment for dependent children who work, for widows or widowers with dependent children, and for medical expenses."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"For the business that wants to expand or modernize its plant, we propose liberalized tax treatment of depreciation, research and development expenses, and retained earnings."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because of the present need for revenue the corporation income tax should be kept at the current rate of 52% for another year, and the excise taxes scheduled to be reduced on April first, including those on liquor, tobacco, gasoline and automobiles, should be continued at present rates."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Immediate extension of the Renegotiation Act of 1951 is also needed to eliminate excessive profits and to prevent waste of public funds in the purchase of defense materials.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,AGRICULTURE The well being of our 160 million people demands a stable and prosperous agriculture.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Conversely, every farmer knows he cannot prosper unless all America prospers."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"As we seek to promote increases in our standard of living, we must be sure that the farmer fairly shares in that increase."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Therefore, a farm program promoting stability and prosperity in all elements of our agriculture is urgently needed."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Agricultural laws now in effect successfully accomplished their wartime purpose of encouraging maximum production of many crops.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Today, production of these crops at such levels far exceeds present demand."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet the laws encouraging such production are still in effect.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The storage facilities of the Commodity Credit Corporation bulge with surplus stocks of dairy products, wheat, cotton, corn, and certain vegetable oils; and the Corporation's presently authorized borrowing authority--$6,750,000,000--is nearly exhausted."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Some products, priced out of domestic markets, and others, priced out of world markets, have piled up in government hands."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In a world in which millions of people are hungry, destruction of food would, of course, be unconscionable."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Yet surplus stocks continue to threaten the market and in spite of the acreage controls authorized by present law, surpluses will continue to accumulate."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,We confront two alternatives.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The first is to impose still greater acreage reductions for some crops and apply rigid Federal controls over the use of the diverted acres.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This will regiment the production of every basic agricultural crop.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,It will place every producer of those crops under the domination and control of the Federal government in Washington.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This alternative is contrary to the fundamental interests, not only of the farmer, but of the Nation as a whole."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Nor is it a real solution to the problem facing us.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The second alternative is to permit the market price for these agricultural products gradually to have a greater influence on the planning of production by farmers, while continuing the assistance of the government."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This is the sound approach.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"To make it effective, surpluses existing when the new program begins must be insulated from the normal channels of trade for special uses."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"These uses would include school lunch programs, disaster relief, emergency assistance to foreign friends, and of particular importance the stockpiling of reserves for a national emergency."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Building on the agricultural laws of 1948 and 1949, we should establish a price support program with enough flexibility to attract the production of needed supplies of essential commodities and to stimulate the consumption of those commodities that are flooding American markets."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Transition to modernized parity must be accomplished gradually.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In no case should there be an abrupt downward change in the dollar level or in the percentage level of price supports.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Next Monday I shall transmit to the Congress my detailed recommendations embodying this approach.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,They have been developed through the cooperation of innumerable individuals vitally interested in agriculture.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,My special message on Monday will briefly describe the consultative and advisory processes to which this whole program has been subjected during the past ten months.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"I have chosen this farm program because it will build markets, protect the consumers' food supply, and move food into consumption instead of into storage."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is a program that will remove the threat to the farmer of these overhanging surpluses, a program, also, that will stimulate production when a commodity is scarce and encourage consumption when nature is bountiful."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, it will promote the individual freedom, responsibility, and initiative which distinguish American agriculture."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"And, by helping our agriculture achieve full parity in the market, it promises our farmers a higher and steadier financial return over the years than any alternative plan."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,CONSERVATION Part of our Nation's precious heritage is its natural resources.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is the common responsibility of Federal, state, and local governments to improve and develop them, always working in the closest harmony and partnership."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,All Federal conservation and resource development projects are being reappraised.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Sound projects now under way will be continued.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"New projects in which the Federal Government has a part must be economically sound, with local sharing of cost wherever appropriate and feasible."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In the next fiscal year work will be started on twenty-three projects that meet these standards.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Federal Government will continue to construct and operate economically sound flood control, power, irrigation and water supply projects wherever these projects are beyond the capacity of local initiative, public or private, and consistent with the needs of the whole Nation."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Our conservation program will also take into account the important role played by farmers in protecting our soil resources.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"I recommend enactment of legislation to strengthen agricultural conservation and upstream flood prevention work, and to achieve a better balance with major flood control structures in the down-stream areas."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Recommendations will be made from time to time for the adoption of: A uniform and consistent water resources policy; A revised public lands policy; and A sound program for safeguarding the domestic production of critical and strategic metals and minerals.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In addition we shall continue to protect and improve our national forests, parks, monuments and other natural and historic sites, as well as our fishery and wildlife resources."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I hope that pending legislation to improve the conservation and management of publicly-owned grazing lands in national forests will soon be approved by the Congress.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"NATIONAL HIGHWAYS To protect the vital interest of every citizen in a safe and adequate highway system, the Federal Government is continuing its central role in the Federal Aid Highway Program."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"So that maximum progress can be made to overcome present inadequacies in the Interstate Highway System, we must continue the Federal gasoline tax at two cents per gallon."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This will require cancellation of the ½¢ decrease which otherwise will become effective April 1st, and will maintain revenues so that an expanded highway program can be undertaken."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"When the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations completes its study of the present system of financing highway construction, I shall promptly submit it for consideration by the Congress and the governors of the states."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"POST OFFICE It is apparent that the substantial savings already made, and to be made, by the Post Office Department cannot eliminate the postal deficit."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"I recommend, therefore, that the Congress approve the bill now pending in the House of Representatives providing for the adjustment of certain postal rates."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"To handle the long term aspects of this, I also recommend that the Congress create a permanent commission to establish fair and reasonable postal rates from time to time in the future."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,III.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"HUMAN PROBLEMS Along with the protection of freedom and maintenance of a strong and growing economy, this Administration recognizes a third great purpose of government: concern for the human problems of our citizens."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In a modern industrial society, banishment of destitution and cushioning the shock of personal disaster on the individual are proper concerns of all levels of government, including the federal government."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,This is especially true where remedy and prevention alike are beyond the individual's capacity.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"LABOR AND WELFARE Of the many problems in this area, those I shall first discuss are of particular concern to the members of our great labor force, who with their heads, hearts and hands produce so much of the wealth of our country."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Protection against the hazards of temporary unemployment should be extended to some 6?millions of workers, including civilian Federal workers, who now lack this safeguard."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, the Secretary of Labor is making available to the states studies and recommendations in the fields of weekly benefits, periods of protection and extension of coverage."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The Economic Report will consider the related matter of minimum wages and their coverage.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The Labor Management Relations Act of 3947 is basically a sound law.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, six years of experience have revealed that in some respects it can be improved."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"On January 11, I shall forward to the Congress suggestions for changes designed to reinforce the basic objectives of the Act."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our basic social security program, the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance system, to which individuals contribute during their productive years and receive benefits based on previous earnings, is designed to shield them from destitution."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Last year I recommended extension of the social insurance system to include more than 10,000,000 additional persons."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I ask that this extension soon be accomplished.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This and other major improvements in the insurance system will bring substantial benefit increases and broaden the membership of the insurance system, thus diminishing the need for Federal grants-in-aid for such purposes."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"A new formula will therefore be proposed, permitting progressive reduction in such grants as the need for them declines."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Federal grant-in-aid welfare programs, now based on widely varying formulas, should be simplified."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Concrete proposals on fourteen of them will be suggested to the appropriate Committees.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The program for rehabilitation of the disabled especially needs strengthening.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through special vocational training, this program presently returns each year some 60,000 handicapped individuals to productive work."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Far more disabled people can be saved each year from idleness and dependence if this program is gradually increased.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,My more detailed recommendations on this and the other social insurance problems I have mentioned will be sent to the Congress on January 14th.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,HEALTH I am flatly opposed to the socialization of medicine.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The great need for hospital and medical services can best be met by the initiative of private plans.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,But it is unfortunately a fact that medical costs are rising and already impose severe hardships on many families.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The Federal Government can do many helpful things and still carefully avoid the socialization of medicine.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Federal Government should encourage medical research in its battle with such mortal diseases as cancer and heart ailments, and should continue to help the states in their health and rehabilitation programs."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The present Hospital Survey and Construction Act should be broadened in order to assist in the development of adequate facilities for the chronically ill, and to encourage the construction of diagnostic centers, rehabilitation facilities, and nursing homes."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The war on disease also needs a better working relationship between Government and private initiative.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Private and non-profit hospital and medical insurance plans are already in the field, soundly based on the experience and initiative of the people in their various communities."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,A limited Government reinsurance service would permit the private and non-profit insurance companies to offer broader protection to more of the many families which want and should have it.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,On January 18 I shall forward to the Congress a special message presenting this Administration's health program in its detail.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,EDUCATION Youth--our greatest resource--is being seriously neglected in a vital respect.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The nation as a whole is not preparing teachers or building schools fast enough to keep up with the increase in our population.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"The preparation of teachers as, indeed, the control and direction of public education policy, is a state and local responsibility."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, the Federal Government should stand ready to assist states which demonstrably cannot provide sufficient school buildings."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"In order to appraise the needs, I hope that this year a conference on education will be held in each state, culminating in a national conference."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"From these conferences on education, every level of government--from the Federal Government to each local school board--should gain the information with which to attack this serious problem."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,HOUSING The details of a program to enlarge and improve the opportunities for our people to acquire good homes will be presented to the Congress by special message on January.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"This program will include: Modernization of the home mortgage insurance program of the Federal Government; Redirection of the present system of loans and grants-in-aid to cities for slum clearance and redevelopment; Extension of the advantages of insured lending to private credit engaged in this task of rehabilitating obsolete neighborhoods; Insurance of long-term, mortgage loans, with small down payment for low-income families; and, until alternative programs prove more effective, Continuation of the public housing program adopted in the Housing Act of 1949."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"If the individual, the community, the State and federal governments will alike apply themselves, every American family can have a decent home."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,VETERANS ADMINISTRATION The internal reorganization of the Veterans Administration is proceeding with my full approval.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"When completed, it will afford a single agency whose services, including medical facilities, will be better adapted to the needs of those 20,000,000 veterans to whom this Nation owes so much."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,SUFFRAGE My few remaining recommendations all relate to a basic right of our citizens--that of being represented in the decisions of the government.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I hope that the States will cooperate with the Congress in adopting uniform standards in their voting laws that will make it possible for our citizens in the armed forces overseas to vote.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,In the District of Columbia the time is long overdue for granting national suffrage to its citizens and also applying the principle of local self-government to the Nation's Capital.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge the Congress to move promptly in this direction and also to revise District revenue measures to provide needed public works improvements.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,The people of Hawaii are ready for statehood.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I renew my request for this legislation in order that Hawaii may elect its State officials and its representatives in Washington along with the rest of the country this fall.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"For years our citizens between the ages of 18 and 21 have, in time of peril, been summoned to fight for America."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,They should participate in the political process that produces this fateful summons.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge Congress to propose to the States a constitutional amendment permitting citizens to vote when they reach the age of 18.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,CONCLUSION I want to add one final word about the general purport of these many recommendations.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our government's powers are wisely limited by the Constitution; but quite apart from those limitations, there are things which no government can do or should try to do."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"A government can strive, as ours is striving, to maintain an economic system whose doors are open to enterprise and ambition--those personal qualities on which economic growth largely depends."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,But enterprise and ambition are qualities which no government can supply.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,Fortunately no American government need concern itself on this score; our people have these qualities in good measure.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"A government can sincerely strive for peace, as ours is striving, and ask its people to make sacrifices for the sake of peace."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,But no government can place peace in the hearts of foreign rulers.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is our duty then to ourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all those ways--spiritual, economic, military--that will give us maximum safety against the possibility of aggressive action by others."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,No government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that plagues our age.
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"Happily, our people, though blessed with more material goods than any people in history, have always reserved their first allegiance to the kingdom of the spirit, which is the true source of that freedom we value above all material things."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"But a government can try, as ours tries, to sense the deepest aspirations of the people, and to express them in political action at home and abroad."
1954,Eisenhower,Republican,"So long as action and aspiration humbly and earnestly seek favor in the sight of the Almighty, there is no end to America's forward road; there is no obstacle on it she will not surmount in her march toward a lasting peace in a free and prosperous world."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 6, 1955 Mr."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"President, Mr."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Speaker, Members of the Congress: First, I extend cordial greetings to the 84th Congress."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall have much to do together; I am sure that we shall get it done and, that we shall do it in harmony and good will."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"At the outset, I believe it would be well to remind ourselves of this great fundamental in our national life: our common belief that every human being is divinely endowed with dignity and worth and inalienable rights."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This faith, with its corollary that to grow and flourish people must be free shapes the interests and aspirations of every American."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"From this deep faith have evolved three main purposes of our Federal Government: First, to maintain justice and freedom among ourselves and to champion them for others so that we may work effectively for enduring peace; Second, to help keep our economy vigorous and expanding, thus sustaining our international strength and assuring better jobs, better living, better opportunities for every citizen; And third, to concern ourselves with the human problems of our people so that every American may have the opportunity to lead a healthy, productive and rewarding life."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Foremost among these broad purposes of government is our support of freedom, justice and peace."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is of the utmost importance, that each of us understands the true nature of the struggle now taking place in the world."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is not a struggle merely of economic theories, or of forms of government, or of military power."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,At issue is the true nature of man.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Either man is the creature whom the Psalmist described as ""a little lower than the angels,"" crowned with glory and honor, holding ""dominion over the works"" of his Creator; or man is a soulless, animated machine to be enslaved, used and consumed by the state for its own glorification."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is, therefore, a struggle which goes to the roots of the human spirit, and its shadow falls across the long sweep of man's destiny."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This prize, so precious, so fraught with ultimate meaning, is the true object of the contending forces in the world."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the past year, there has been progress justifying hope, both for continuing peace and for the ultimate rule of freedom and justice in the world."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Free nations are collectively stronger than at any time in recent years.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Just as nations of this Hemisphere, in the historic Caracas and Rio conferences, have closed ranks against imperialistic Communism and strengthened their economic ties, so free nations elsewhere have forged new bonds of unity."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Recent agreements between Turkey and Pakistan have laid a foundation for increased strength in the Middle East.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"With our understanding support, Egypt and Britain, Yugoslavia and Italy, Britain and Iran have resolved dangerous differences."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The security of the Mediterranean has been enhanced by an alliance among Greece, Turkey and Yugoslavia."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Agreements in Western Europe have paved the way for unity to replace past divisions which have undermined Europe's economic and military vitality.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The defense of the West appears likely at last to include a free, democratic Germany participating as an equal in the councils of NATO."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In Asia and the Pacific, the pending Manila Pact supplements our treaties with Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Korea and Japan and our prospective treaty with the Republic of China."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These pacts stand as solemn warning that future military aggression and subversion against the free nations of Asia will meet united response.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Pacific Charter, also adopted at Manila, is a milestone in the development of human freedom and self-government in the Pacific area."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Under the auspices of the United Nations, there is promise of progress in our country's plan for the peaceful use of atomic energy."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Finally, today the world is at peace."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is, to be sure, a secure peace."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet all humanity finds hope in the simple fact that for an appreciable time there has been no active major battlefield on earth.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This same fact inspires us to work all the more effectively with other nations for the well being, the freedom, the dignity, of every human on earth."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"These developments are heartening indeed, and we are hopeful of continuing progress."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,But sobering problems remain.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The massive military machines and ambitions of the Soviet-Communist bloc still create uneasiness in the world.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"All of us are aware of the continuing reliance of the Soviet Communists on military force, of the power of their weapons, of their present resistance to realistic armament limitation, and of their continuing effort to dominate or intimidate free nations on their periphery."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Their steadily growing power includes an increasing strength in nuclear weapons.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This power, combined with the proclaimed intentions of the Communist leaders to communize the world, is the threat confronting us today."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To protect our nations and our peoples from the catastrophe of a nuclear holocaust, free nations must maintain countervailing military power to persuade the Communists of the futility of seeking their ends through aggression."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,If Communist rulers understand that America's response to aggression will be swift and decisive--that never shall we buy peace at the expense of honor or faith--they will be powerfully deterred from launching a military venture engulfing their own peoples and many others in disaster.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This, of course, is merely world stalemate."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,But in this stalemate each of us may and must exercise his high duty to strive in every honorable way for enduring peace.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The military threat is but one menace to our freedom and security.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must not only deter aggression; we must also frustrate the effort of Communists to gain their goals by subversion.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To this end, free nations must maintain and reinforce their cohesion, their internal security, their political and economic vitality, and their faith in freedom."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In such a world, America's course is dear: We must tirelessly labor to make the peace more just and durable."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must strengthen the collective defense under the United Nations Charter and gird ourselves with sufficient military strength and productive capacity to discourage resort to war and protect our nation's vital interests.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must continue to support and strengthen the United Nations.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"At this very moment, by vote of the United Nations General Assembly, its Secretary-General is in Communist China on a mission of deepest concern to all Americans: seeking the release of our never-to-be-forgotten American aviators and all other United Nations prisoners wrongfully detained by the Communist regime."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must also encourage the efforts being made in the United Nations to limit armaments and to harness the atom to peaceful rise.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must expand international trade and investment and assist friendly nations whose own best efforts are still insufficient to provide the strength essential to the security of the free world.We must be willing to use the processes of negotiation whenever they will advance the cause of just and secure peace to which the United States and other free nations are dedicated.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In respect to all these matters, we must, through a vigorous information program, keep the peoples of the world truthfully advised of our actions and purposes."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This problem has been attacked with new vigor during the past months.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge that the Congress give its earnest consideration to the great advantages that can accrue to our country through the successful operations of this program.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must also carry forward our educational exchange program.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This sharing of knowledge and experience between our citizens and those of free countries is a powerful factor in the development and maintenance of true partnership among free peoples.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To advance these many efforts, the Congress must act in this session on appropriations, legislation, and treaties."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Today I shall mention especially our foreign economic and military programs.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The recent economic progress in many free nations has been most heartening.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The productivity of labor and the production of goods and services are increasing in ever-widening areas.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,There is a growing will to improve the living standards of all men.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This progress is important to all our people.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It promises us allies who are strong and self-reliant; it promises a growing world market for the products of our mines, our factories, and our farms."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,But only through steady effort can we hope to continue this progress.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Barriers still impede trade and the flow of capital needed to develop each nation's human and material resources.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Wise reduction of these barriers is a long-term objective of our foreign economic policy--a policy of an evolutionary and selective nature, assuring broad benefits to our own and other peoples."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must gradually reduce certain tariff obstacles to trade.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"These actions should, of course, be accompanied by a similar lowering of trade barriers by other nations, so that we may move steadily toward greater economic advantage for all."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must further simplify customs administration and procedures.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must facilitate the flow of capital and continue technical assistance, both directly and through the United Nations, to less developed countries to strengthen their independence and raise their living standards."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Many another step must be taken in and among the nations of the free world to release forces of private initiative.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In our own nation, these forces have brought strength and prosperity; once released, they will generate rising incomes in these other countries with which to buy the products of American industry, labor and agriculture."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"On January 10, by special message, I shall submit specific recommendations for carrying forward the legislative phases of our foreign economic policy."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Our many efforts to build a better world include the maintenance of our military strength.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This is a vast undertaking.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Major national security programs consume two-thirds of the entire Federal budget.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Over four million Americans--servicemen and civilians--are on the rolls of the defense establishment.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the past two years, by eliminating duplication and over staffing, by improved procurement and inventory controls, and by concentrating on the essentials, many billions of dollars have been saved in our defense activities."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I should like to mention certain fundamentals underlying this vast program.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, a realistic limitation of armaments and an enduring, just peace remain our national goals; we maintain powerful military forces because there is no present alternative--forces designed for deterrent and defensive purposes alone but able instantly to strike back with destructive power in response to an attack."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, we must stay alert to the fact that undue reliance on one weapon or preparation for only one kind of warfare simply invites an enemy to resort to another."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must, therefore, keep in our armed forces balance and flexibility adequate for our purposes and objectives."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, to keep our armed forces abreast of the advances of science, our military planning must be flexible enough to utilize the new weapons and techniques which flow ever more speedily from our research and development programs."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The forthcoming military budget therefore emphasizes modern air power in the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and increases the emphasis on new weapons, especially those of rapid and destructive striking power."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It assures the maintenance of effective, retaliatory force as the principal deterrent to overt aggression."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,It accelerates the continental defense program and the build-up of ready military reserve forces.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,It continues a vigorous program of stockpiling strategic and critical materials and strengthening our mobilization base.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The budget also contemplates the strategic concentration of our strength through redeployment of certain forces.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It provides for reduction of forces in certain categories and their expansion in others, to fit them to the military realities of our time."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These emphases in our defense planning have been made at my personal direction after long and thoughtful study.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In my judgment, they will give our nation a defense accurately adjusted to the national need."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fourth, pending a world agreement on armament limitation, we must continue to improve and expand our supplies of nuclear weapons for our land, naval and air forces, while, at the same time, continuing our encouraging progress in the peaceful use of atomic power."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"And fifth, in the administration of these costly programs, we must demand the utmost in efficiency and ingenuity."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must assure our people not only of adequate protection but also of a defense that can be carried forward from year to year until the threat of aggression has disappeared.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To help maintain this kind of armed strength and improve its efficiency, I must urge the enactment of several important measures in this session."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The first concerns the selective service act which expires next June 30th.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"For the foreseeable future, our standing forces must remain much larger than voluntary methods can sustain."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must, therefore, extend the statutory authority to induct men for two years of military service."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The second kind of measure concerns the rapid turnover of our most experienced servicemen.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This process seriously weakens the combat readiness of our armed forces and is exorbitantly expensive.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To encourage more trained servicemen to remain in uniform, I shall, on the thirteenth of this month, propose a number of measures to increase the attractions of a military career."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"These measures will include more adequate medical care for dependents, survivors' benefits, more and better housing, and selective adjustments in military pay and other allowances."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,And third--also on January 13--I shall present a program to rebuild and strengthen the civilian components of our armed forces.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This is a comprehensive program, designed to make better use of our manpower of military age."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because it will go far in assuring fair and equitable participation in military training and service, it is of particular importance to our combat veterans."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In keeping with the historic military policy of our Republic, this program is designed to build and maintain powerful civilian reserves immediately capable of effective military service in an emergency in lieu of maintaining active duty forces in excess of the nation's immediate need."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Maintenance of an effective defense requires continuance of our aggressive attack on subversion at home.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this effort we have, in the past two years, made excellent progress."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,FBI investigations have been powerfully reinforced by a new Internal Security Division in the Department of Justice; the security activities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service have been revitalized; an improved and strengthened security system is in effect throughout the government; the Department of Justice and the FBI have been armed with effective new legal weapons forged by the 83rd Congress.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall continue to ferret out and to destroy Communist subversion.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall, in the process, carefully preserve our traditions and the basic rights of our citizens."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Our civil defense program is also a key element in the protection of our country.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We are developing cooperative methods with State Governors, Mayors, and voluntary citizen groups, as well as among Federal agencies, in building the civil defense organization."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Its significance in time of war is obvious; its swift assistance in disaster areas last year proved its importance in time of peace.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,An industry capable of rapid expansion and essential materials and facilities swiftly available in time of emergency are indispensable to our defense.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I urge, therefore, a two-year extension of the Defense Production Act and Title II of the First War Powers Act of 1941."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These are cornerstones of our program for the development and maintenance of an adequate mobilization base.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"At this point, I should like to make this additional observation."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our quest for peace and freedom necessarily presumes that we who hold positions of public trust must rise above self and section--that we must subordinate to the general good our partisan, our personal pride and prejudice."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Tirelessly, with united purpose, we must fortify the material and spiritual foundations of this land of freedom and of free nations throughout the world."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"As never before, there is need for unhesitating cooperation among the branches of our government."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,At this time the executive and legislative branches are under the management of different political parties.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This fact places both parties on trial before the American people.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In less perilous days of the past, division of governmental responsibility among our great parties has produced a paralyzing indecision."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must not let this happen in our time.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must avoid a paralysis of the will for peace and international security.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the traditionally bipartisan areas--military security and foreign relations--I can report to you that I have already, with the leaders of this Congress, expressed assurances of unreserved cooperation."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Yet, the strength of our country requires more than mere maintenance of military strength and success in foreign affairs; these vital matters are in turn dependent upon concerted and vigorous action in a number of supporting programs."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I say, therefore, to the 84th Congress: In all areas basic to the strength of America, there will be--to the extent I can insure them--cooperative, constructive relations between the Executive and Legislative Branches of this government."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Let the general good be our yardstick on every great issue of our time.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our efforts to defend our freedom and to secure a just peace are, of course, inseparable from the second great purpose of our government: to help maintain a strong, growing economy--an economy vigorous and free, in which there are ever-increasing opportunities, just rewards for effort, and a stable prosperity that is widely shared."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the past two years, many important governmental Actions helped our economy adjust to conditions of peace; these and other actions created a climate for renewed economic growth."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Controls were removed from wages, prices and materials."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Tax revisions encouraged increased private spending and employment.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Federal expenditures were sharply reduced, making possible a record tax cut."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"These actions, together with flexible monetary and debt management policies, helped to halt inflation and stabilize the value of the dollar."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,A program of cooperation and partnership in resource development was begun.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Social security and unemployment insurance laws were broadened and strengthened.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,New laws started the long process of balancing farm production with farm markets.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Expanded shipbuilding and stockpiling programs strengthened key sectors of the economy, while improving our mobilization base."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,A comprehensive new housing law brought impressive progress in an area fundamental to our economic strength and closed loopholes in the old laws permitting dishonest manipulation.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Many of these programs are just beginning to exert their main stimulating effect upon the economy generally and upon specific communities and industries throughout the country.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The past year--1954--was one of the most prosperous years in our history.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Business activity now surges with new strength.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Production is rising.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Employment is high.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Toward the end of last year average weekly wages in manufacturing were higher than ever before.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Personal income after taxes is at a record level.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,So is consumer spending.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Construction activity is reaching new peaks.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Export demand for our goods is strong.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,State and local government expenditures on public works are rising.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Savings are high, and credit is readily available."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"So, today, the transition to a peacetime economy is largely behind us."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The economic outlook is good.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The many promising factors I have mentioned do not guarantee sustained economic expansion; however, they do give us a strong position from which to carry forward our economic growth."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we as a people act wisely, within ten years our annual national output can rise from its present level of about $360 billion to $500 billion, measured in dollars of stable buying power."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"My Budget Message on January 17, the Economic Report on the 20th of this month, and several special messages will set forth in detail major programs to foster the growth of our economy and to protect the integrity of the people's money."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Today I shall discuss these programs only in general terms.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Government efficiency and economy remain essential to steady progress toward a balanced budget.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"More than ten billion dollars were cut from the spending program proposed in the budget of January 9, 1953."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Expenditures of that year were six and a half billion below those of the previous year.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the current fiscal year, government spending will be nearly four and a half billion dollars less than in the fiscal year which ended last June 30."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"New spending authority has been held below expenditures, reducing government obligations accumulated over the years."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Last year we had a large tax cut and, for the first time in seventy-five years a basic revision of Federal tax laws."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,It is now clear that defense and other essential government costs must remain at a level precluding further tax reductions this year.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Although excise and corporation income taxes must, therefore, be continued at their present rates, further tax cuts will be possible when justified by lower expenditures and by revenue increases arising from the nation's economic growth."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I am hopeful that such reductions can be made next year.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"At the foundation of our economic growth are the raw materials and energy produced from our minerals and fuels, lands and forests, and water resources."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"With respect to them, I believe that the nation must adhere to three fundamental policies: first, to develop, wisely use and conserve basic resources from generation to generation; second, to follow the historic pattern of developing these resources primarily by private citizens under fair provisions of law, including restraints for proper conservation; and third, to treat resource development as a partnership undertaking--a partnership in which the participation of private citizens and State and local governments is as necessary as Federal participation."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This policy of partnership and cooperation is producing good results, most immediately noticeable in respect to water resources."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, it has encouraged local public bodies and private citizens to plan their own power sources."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Increasing numbers of applications to the Federal Power Commission to conduct surveys and prepare plans for power development, notably in the Columbia River Basin, are evidence of local response."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, the Federal Government and local and private organizations have been encouraged to coordinate their developments."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This is important because Federal hydroelectric developments supply but a small fraction of the nation's power needs.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such partnership projects as Priest Rapids in Washington, the Coosa River development in Alabama, and Markham Ferry in Oklahoma already have the approval of the Congress."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This year justifiable projects of a similar nature will again have Administration support.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, the Federal Government must shoulder its own partnership obligations by undertaking projects of such complexity and size that their success requires Federal development."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In keeping with this principle, I again urge the Congress to approve the development of the Upper Colorado River Basin to conserve and assure better use of precious water essential to the future of the West."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In addition, the 1956 budget will recommend appropriations to start six new reclamation and more than thirty new Corps of Engineers projects of varying size."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Going projects and investigations of potential new resource developments will be continued.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Although this partnership approach is producing encouraging results, its full success requires a nation-wide comprehensive water resources policy firmly based in law."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Such a policy is under preparation and when completed will be submitted to the Congress.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the interest of their proper conservation, development and use, continued vigilance will be maintained over our fisheries, wildlife resources, the national parks and forests, and the public lands; and we shall continue to encourage an orderly development of the nation's mineral resources."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"A modern, efficient highway system is essential to meet the needs of our growing population, our expanding economy, and our national security."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We are accelerating our highway improvement program as rapidly as possible under existing State and Federal laws and authorizations.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, this effort will not in itself assure our people of an adequate highway system."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"On my recommendation, this problem has been carefully considered by the Conference of State Governors and by a special Advisory Committee on a National Highway Program, composed of leading private citizens."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I have received the recommendations of the Governors' Conference and will shortly receive the views of the special Advisory Committee.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Aided by their findings, I shall submit on January 27th detailed recommendations which will meet our most pressing national highway needs."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In further recognition of the importance of transportation to our economic strength and security, the Administration, through a Cabinet committee, is thoroughly examining existing Federal transportation policies to determine their effect on the adequacy of transportation services."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This is the first such comprehensive review directly undertaken by the Executive Branch of the government in modern times.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We are not only examining major problems facing the various modes of transport; we are also studying closely the inter-relationships of civilian and government requirements for transportation.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislation will be recommended to correct policy deficiencies which we may find.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The nation's public works activities are tremendous in scope.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is expected that more than $ 12 billion will be expended in 1955 for the development of land, water and other resources; control of floods, and navigation and harbor improvements; construction of roads, schools, and municipal water supplies, and disposal of domestic and industrial wastes."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Many of the Federal, State and local agencies responsible for this work are, in their separate capacities, highly efficient."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,But public works activities are closely inter-related and have a substantial influence on the growth of the country.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, in times of threatening economic contraction, they may become a valuable sustaining force."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To these ends, efficient planning and execution of the nation's public works require both the coordination of Federal activities and effective cooperation with State and local governments."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Council of Economic Advisers, through its public works planning section, has made important advances during the past year in effecting this coordination and cooperation."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In view of the success of these initial efforts, and to give more emphasis and continuity to this essential coordination, I shall request the Congress to appropriate funds for the support of an Office of Coordinator of Public Works in the Executive Office of the President."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"A most significant element in our growing economy is an agriculture that is stable, prosperous and free."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The problems of our agriculture have evolved over many years and cannot be solved overnight; nevertheless, governmental actions last year hold great promise of fostering a better balance between production and markets and, consequently, a better and more stable income for our farmers."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through vigorous administration and through new authority provided by the 83rd Congress, surplus farm products are now moving into consumption."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"From February 1953 through November 1954, the rate of increase of government-held surpluses has been reduced by our moving into use more than 2.3 billion dollars' worth of government-owned farm commodities; this amount is equal to more than seven percent of a year's production of all our farms and ranches."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Domestic consumption remains high, and farm exports will be higher than last year."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a result of the flexibility provided by the Agricultural Act of 1954, we can move toward less restrictive acreage controls."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thus, farm production is gradually adjusting to markets, markets are being expanded, and stocks are moving into use."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We can now look forward to an easing of the influences depressing farm prices, to reduced government expenditures for purchase of surplus products, and to less Federal intrusion into the lives and plans of our farm people."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Agricultural programs have been redirected toward better balance, greater stability and sustained prosperity."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We are headed in the right direction.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I urgently recommend to the Congress that we continue resolutely on this road.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Greater attention must be directed to the needs of low-income farm families.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Twenty-eight per cent of our farm-operator families have net cash incomes of less than $1,000 per year."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Last year, at my request, careful studies were made of the problems of these farm people."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall later submit recommendations designed to assure the steady alleviation of their most pressing concerns.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because drought also remains a serious agricultural problem, I shall recommend legislation to strengthen Federal disaster assistance programs."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This legislation will prescribe an improved appraisal of need, better adjustment of the various programs to local conditions, and a more equitable sharing of costs between the States and the Federal Government."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The prosperity of our small business enterprises is an indispensable element in the maintenance of our economic strength.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Creation of the Small Business Administration and recently enacted tax laws facilitating small business expansion are but two of many important steps we have taken to encourage our smaller enterprises.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I recommend that the Congress extend the Small Business Act of 1953 which is due to expire next June.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We come now to the third great purpose of our government-its concern for the health, productivity and well-being of all our people."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Every citizen wants to give full expression to his God-given talents and abilities and to have the recognition and respect accorded under our religious and political traditions.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Americans also want a good material standard of living--not simply to accumulate possessions, but to fulfill a legitimate aspiration for an environment in which their families may live meaningful and happy lives."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our people are committed, therefore, to the creation and preservation of opportunity for every citizen to lead a more rewarding life."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,They are equally committed to the alleviation of misfortune and distress among their fellow citizens.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The aspirations of most of our people can best be fulfilled through their own enterprise and initiative, without government interference."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"This Administration, therefore, follows two simple rules: first, the Federal Government should perform an essential task only when it cannot otherwise be adequately performed; and second, in performing that task, our government must not impair the self-respect, freedom and incentive of the individual."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"So long as these two rules are observed, the government can fully meet its obligation without creating a dependent population or a domineering bureaucracy."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the past two years, notable advances were made in these functions of government."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Protection of old-age and survivors' insurance was extended to an additional ten million of our people, and the benefits were substantially increased."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislation was enacted to provide unemployment insurance protection to some four million additional Americans.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Stabilization of living costs and the halting of inflation protected the value of pensions and savings.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,A broad program now helps to bring good homes within the reach of the great majority of our people.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"With the States, we are providing rehabilitation facilities and more clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes for patients with chronic illnesses."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Also with the States, we have begun a great and fruitful expansion in the restoration of disabled persons to employment and useful lives."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the areas of Federal responsibility, we have made historic progress in eliminating from among our people demeaning practices based on race or color."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,All of us may be proud of these achievements during the past two years.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet essential Federal tasks remain to be done.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"As part of our efforts to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for low-income families, we must carry forward the housing program authorized during the 83rd Congress."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must also authorize contracts for a firm program of 35,000 additional public housing units in each of the next two fiscal years."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This program will meet the most pressing obligations of the Federal Government into the 1958 fiscal year for planning and building public housing.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"By that time the private building industry, aided by the Housing Act of 1954, will have had the opportunity to assume its full role in providing adequate housing for our low income families."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The health of our people is one of our most precious assets.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Preventable sickness should be prevented; knowledge available to combat disease and disability should be fully used.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Otherwise, we as a people are guilty not only of neglect of human suffering but also of wasting our national strength."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Constant advances in medical care are not available to enough of our citizens.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Clearly our nation must do more to reduce the impact of accident and disease.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Two fundamental problems confront us: first, high and ever-rising costs of health services; second, serious gaps and shortages in these services."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"By special message on January 24, I shall propose a coordinated program to strengthen and improve existing health services."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This program will continue to reject socialized medicine.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,It will emphasize individual and local responsibility.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Under it the Federal Government will neither dominate nor direct, but serve as a helpful partner."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Within this framework, the program can be broad in scope."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,My recommendations will include a Federal health reinsurance service to encourage the development of more and better voluntary health insurance coverage by private organizations.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall also recommend measures to improve the medical care of that group of our citizens who, because of need, receive Federal-State public assistance."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These two proposals will help more of our people to meet the costs of health services.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To reduce the gaps in these services, I shall propose: New measures to facilitate construction of needed health facilities and help reduce shortages of trained health personnel; Vigorous steps to combat the misery and national loss involved in mental illness; Improved services for crippled children and for maternal and child health; Better consumer protection under our existing pure food and drug laws; and, finally, Strengthened programs to combat the increasingly serious pollution of our rivers and streams and the growing problem of air pollution."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These measures together constitute a comprehensive program holding rich promise for better health for all of our people.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Last year's expansion of social security coverage and our new program of improved medical care for public assistance recipients together suggest modification of the formula for Federal sharing in old age assistance payments.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I recommend modification of the formula where such payments will, in the future, supplement benefits received under the old age and survivors insurance system."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is the inalienable right of every person, from childhood on, to have access to knowledge."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In our form of society, this right of the individual takes on a special meaning, for the education of all our citizens is imperative to the maintenance and invigoration of America's free institutions."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Today, we face grave educational problems."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Effective and up-to-date analyses of these problems and their solutions are being carried forward through the individual State conferences and the White House Conference to be completed this year.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, such factors as population growth, additional responsibilities of schools, and increased and longer school attendance have produced an unprecedented classroom shortage."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,This shortage is of immediate concern to all of our people.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Positive, affirmative action must be taken now."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Without impairing in any way the responsibilities of our States, localities, communities, or families, the Federal government can and should serve as an effective-catalyst in dealing with this problem."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall forward a special message to the Congress on February 15, presenting an affirmative program dealing with this shortage."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"To help the States do a better and more timely job, we must strengthen their resources for preventing and dealing with juvenile delinquency."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall propose Federal legislation to assist the States to promote concerted action in dealing with this nationwide problem.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall carry forward the vigorous efforts of the Administration to improve the international control of the traffic in narcotics and, in cooperation with State and local agencies, to combat narcotic addiction in our country."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I should like to speak now of additional matters of importance to all our people and especially to our wage earners.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,During the past year certain industrial changes and the readjustment of the economy to conditions of peace brought unemployment and other difficulties to various localities and industries.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These problems are engaging our most earnest attention.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"But for the overwhelming majority of our working people, the past year has meant good jobs."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, the earnings and savings of our wage earners are no longer depreciating in value."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because of cooperative relations between labor and management, fewer working days were lost through strikes in 1954 than in any year in the past decade."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The outlook for our wage earners can be made still more promising by several legislative actions.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, in the past five years we have had economic growth which will support an increase in the Federal minimum wage."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the light of present economic conditions, I recommend its increase to ninety cents an hour."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I also recommend that many others, at present excluded, be given the protection of a minimum wage."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, I renew my recommendation of last year for amendment of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 to further the basic objectives of this statute."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I especially call to the attention of the Congress amendments dealing with the right of economic strikers to vote in representation elections and the need for equalizing the obligation under the Act to file disclaimers of Communist affiliation.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, the Administration will propose other important measures including occupational safety, workmen's compensation for longshoremen and harbor workers, and the ""Eight Hour Laws"" applicable to Federal contractors."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislation will also be proposed respecting nonoccupational disability insurance and unemployment compensation in the District of Columbia.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In considering human needs, the Federal Government must take special responsibility for citizens in its direct employ."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,On January 11 I shall propose a pay adjustment plan for civilian employees outside the Postal Field Service to correct inequities and increase individual pay rates.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall also recommend voluntary health insurance on a contributory basis for Federal employees and their dependents.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In keeping with the Group Life Insurance Act passed in the 83rd Congress, this protection should be provided on the group insurance principle and purchased from private facilities."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Also on January 11 I shall recommend a modern pay plan, including pay increases, for postal field employees."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"As part of this program, and to carry forward our progress toward elimination of the large annual postal deficit."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall renew my request for an increase in postal rates.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Again I urge that in the future the fixing of rates be delegated to an impartial, independent body."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"More adequate training programs to equip career employees of the government to render improved public service will be recommended, as will improvements in the laws affecting employees serving on foreign assignments."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Needed improvements in survivor, disability, and retirement benefits for Federal civilian and military personnel have been extensively considered by the Committee on Retirement Policy for Federal personnel."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Committee's proposals would strengthen and improve benefits for our career people in government, and I endorse their broad objectives."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Full contributory coverage under old-age and survivors' insurance should be made available to all Federal personnel, just as in private industry."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"For career military personnel, the protection of the old-age and survivors' insurance system would be an important and long-needed addition, especially to their present unequal and inadequate survivorship protection."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,The military retirement pay system should remain separate and unchanged.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Certain adjustments in the present civilian personnel retirement systems will be needed to reflect the additional protection of old-age and survivors' insurance.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, these systems also are a basic part of a total compensation and should be separately and independently retained."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I also urge the Congress to approve a long overdue increase in the salaries of Members of the Congress and of the Federal judiciary to a level commensurate with their heavy responsibilities.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Our concern for the individual in our country requires that we consider several additional problems.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We must continue our program to help our Indian citizens improve their lot and make their full contribution to national life.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Two years ago I advised the Congress of injustices under existing immigration laws.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through humane administration, the Department of Justice is doing what it legally can to alleviate hardships."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Clearance of aliens before arrival has been initiated, and except for criminal offenders, the imprisonment of aliens awaiting admission or deportation has been stopped."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Certain provisions of law, however, have the effect of compelling action in respect to aliens which are inequitable in some instances and discriminatory in others."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,These provisions should be corrected in this session of the Congress.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"As the complex problems of Alaska are resolved, that Territory should expect to achieve statehood."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the meantime, there is no justification for deferring the admission to statehood of Hawaii."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I again urge approval of this measure.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,We have three splendid opportunities to demonstrate the strength of our belief in the right of suffrage.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, I again urge that a Constitutional amendment be submitted to the States to reduce the voting age for Federal elections."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, I renew my request that the principle of self-government be extended and the right of suffrage granted to the citizens of the District of Columbia."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, I again recommend that we work with the States to preserve the voting fights of citizens in the nation's service overseas."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In our determination to keep faith with those who in the past have met the highest call of citizenship, we now have under study the system of benefits for veterans and for surviving dependents of deceased veterans and servicemen."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Studies will be undertaken to determine the need for measures to ease the readjustment to civilian life of men required to enter the armed forces for two years of service.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the advancement of the various activities which will make our civilization endure and flourish, the Federal Government should do more to give official recognition to the importance of the arts and other cultural activities."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall recommend the establishment of a Federal Advisory Commission on the Arts within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, to advise the Federal Government on ways to encourage artistic endeavor and appreciation."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall also propose that awards of merit be established whereby we can honor our fellow citizens who make great contribution to the advancement of our civilization.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Every citizen rightly expects efficient and economical administration of these many government programs I have outlined today.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I strongly recommend extension of the Reorganization Act and the law establishing the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, both of which expire this spring."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,Thus the Congress will assure continuation of the excellent progress recently made in improving government organization and administration.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,In this connection we are looking forward with great interest to the reports which will soon be going to the Congress from the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am sure that these studies, made under the chairmanship of former President Herbert Hoover with the assistance of more than two hundred distinguished citizens, will be of great value in paving the way toward more efficiency and economy in the government."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"And now, I return to the point at which I began--the faith of our people."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The many programs here summarized are, I believe, in full keeping with their needs, interests and aspirations."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"The obligations upon us are clear: To labor earnestly, patiently, prayerfully, for peace, for freedom, for justice, throughout the world; To keep our economy vigorous and free, that our people may lead fuller, happier lives; To advance, not merely by our words but by our acts, the determination of our government that every citizen shall have opportunity to develop to his fullest capacity."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"As we do these things, before us is a future filled with opportunity and hope."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"That future will be ours if in our time we keep alive the patience, the courage, the confidence in tomorrow, the deep faith, of the millions who, in years past, made and preserved us this nation."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"A decade ago, in the death and desolation of European battlefields, I saw the courage and resolution, I felt the inspiration, of American youth."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,In these young men I felt America's buoyant confidence and irresistible will-to-do.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"In them I saw, too, a devout America, humble before God."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,"And so, I know with all my heart--and I deeply believe that all Americans know--that, despite the anxieties of this divided world, our faith, and the cause in which we all believe, will surely prevail."
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,DWIGHT D.
1955,Eisenhower,Republican,EISENHOWER
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION The opening of this new year must arouse in us all grateful thanks to a kind Providence whose protection has been ever present and whose bounty has been manifold and abundant.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The State of the Union today demonstrates what can be accomplished under God by a free people; by their vision, their understanding of national problems, their initiative, their self-reliance, their capacity for work--and by their willingness to sacrifice whenever sacrifice is needed."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the past three years, responding to what our people want their Government to do, the Congress and the Executive have done much in building a stronger, better America."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"There has been broad progress in fostering the energies of our people, in providing greater opportunity for the satisfaction of their needs, and in fulfilling their demands for the strength and security of the Republic."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our country is at peace.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our security posture commands respect.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,A spiritual vigor marks our national life.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our economy, approaching the 400 billion dollar mark, is at an unparalleled level of prosperity."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The national income is more widely and fairly distributed than ever before.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The number of Americans at work has reached an all-time high.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a people, we are achieving consuming more, building more and investing more than ever before."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Virtually all sectors of our society are sharing in these good times.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our farm families, if we act wisely, imaginatively and promptly to strengthen our present farm programs, can also look forward to sharing equitably in the prosperity they have helped to create."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,War in Korea ended two and a half years ago.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The collective security system has been powerfully strengthened.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our defenses have been reinforced at sharply reduced costs.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Programs to expand world trade and to harness the atom for the betterment of mankind have been carried forward.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our economy has been freed from governmental wage and price controls.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Inflation has been halted; the cost of living stabilized.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Government spending has been cut by more than ten billion dollars.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Nearly three hundred thousand positions have been eliminated from the Federal payroll.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Taxes have been substantially reduced.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,A balanced budget is in prospect.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Social security has been extended to ten million more Americans and unemployment insurance to four million more.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Unprecedented advances in civil rights have been made.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The long-standing and deep-seated problems of agriculture have been forthrightly attacked.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This record of progress has been accomplished with a self-imposed caution against unnecessary and unwise interference in the private affairs of our people, of their communities and of the several States."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we of the Executive and Legislative Branches, keeping this caution ever in mind, address ourselves to the business of the year before us-- and to the unfinished business of last year--with resolution, the outlook is bright with promise."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Many measures of great national importance recommended last year to the Congress still demand immediate attention--legislation for school and highway construction; health and immigration legislation; water resources legislation; legislation to complete the implementation of our foreign economic policy; such labor legislation as amendments of the Labor-Management Relations Act, extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act to additional groups not now covered, and occupational safety legislation; and legislation for construction of an atomic-powered exhibit vessel."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Many new items of business likewise require our attention-- measures that will further promote the release of the energies of our people; that will broaden opportunity for all of them; that will advance the Republic in its leadership toward a just peace; measures, in short, that are essential to the building of an ever-stronger, ever-better America."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Every political and economic guide supports a valid confidence that wise effort will be rewarded by an even more plentiful harvest of human benefit than we now enjoy.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our resources are too many, our principles too dynamic, our purposes too worthy and the issues at stake too immense for us to entertain doubt or fear."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,But our responsibilities require that we approach this year's business with a sober humility.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"A heedless pride in our present strength and position would blind us to the facts of the past, to the pitfalls of the future."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must walk ever in the knowledge that we are enriched by a heritage earned in the labor and sacrifice of our forebears; that, for our children's children, we are trustees of a great Republic and a time-tested political system; that we prosper as a cooperating member of the family of nations."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this light the Administration has continued work on its program for the Republic, begun three years ago."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because the vast spread of national and human interests is involved within it, I shall not in this Message attempt its detailed delineation."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Instead, from time to time during this Session, there will be submitted to the Congress specific recommendations within specific fields."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the comprehensive survey required for their preparation, the Administration is guided by enduring objectives."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The first is: THE DISCHARGE OF OUR WORLD RESPONSIBILITY Our world policy and our actions are dedicated to the achievement of peace with justice for all nations.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"With this purpose, we move in a wide variety of ways and through many agencies to remove the pall of fear; to strengthen the ties with our partners and to improve the cooperative cohesion of the free world; to reduce the burden of armaments, and to stimulate and inspire action among all nations for a world of justice and prosperity and peace."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,These national objectives are fully supported by both our political parties.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the past year, our search for a more stable and just peace has taken varied forms."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Among the most important were the two Conferences at Geneva, in July and in the fall of last year."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We explored the possibilities of agreement on critical issues that jeopardize the peace.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The July meeting of Heads of Government held out promise to the world of moderation in the bitterness, of word and action, which tends to generate conflict and war."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,All were in agreement that a nuclear war would be an intolerable disaster which must not be permitted to occur.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"But in October, when the Foreign Ministers met again, the results demonstrated conclusively that the Soviet leaders are not yet willing to create the indispensable conditions for a secure and lasting peace."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Nevertheless, it is clear that the conflict between international communism and freedom has taken on a new complexion."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We know the Communist leaders have often practiced the tactics of retreat and zigzag.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We know that Soviet and Chinese communism still poses a serious threat to the free world.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,And in the Middle East recent Soviet moves are hardly compatible with the reduction of international tension.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Yet Communist tactics against the free nations have shifted in emphasis from reliance on violence and the threat of violence to reliance on division, enticement and duplicity."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must be well prepared to meet the current tactics which pose a dangerous though less obvious threat.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"At the same time, our policy must be dynamic as well as flexible, designed primarily to forward the achievement of our own objectives rather than to meet each shift and change on the Communist front."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must act in the firm assurance that the fruits of freedom are more attractive and desirable to mankind in the pursuit of happiness than the record of Communism.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the face of Communist military power, we must, of course, continue to maintain an effective system of collective security."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This involves two things--a system which gives clear warning that armed aggression will be met by joint action of the free nations, and deterrent military power to make that warning effective."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, the awesome power of the atom must be made to serve as a guardian of the free community and of the peace."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the last year, the free world has seen major gains for the system of collective security: the accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Western European Union of the sovereign Federal German Republic; the developing cooperation under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty; and the formation in the Middle East of the Baghdad Pact among Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In our own hemisphere, the inter-American system has continued to show its vitality in maintaining peace and a common approach to world problems."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We now have security pacts with more than 40 other nations.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the pursuit of our national purposes, we have been steadfast in our support of the United Nations, now entering its second decade with a wider membership and ever-increasing influence and usefulness."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the release of our fifteen fliers from Communist China, an essential prelude was the world opinion mobilized by the General Assembly, which condemned their imprisonment and demanded their liberation."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The successful Atomic Energy Conference held in Geneva under United Nations auspices and our Atoms for Peace program have been practical steps toward the world-wide use of this new energy source.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our sponsorship of such use has benefited our relations with other countries.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Active negotiations are now in progress to create an International Agency to foster peaceful uses of atomic energy.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,During the past year the crucial problem of disarmament has moved to the forefront of practical political endeavor.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"At Geneva, I declared the readiness of the United States to exchange blueprints of the military establishments of our nation and the U.S.S.R., to be confirmed by reciprocal aerial reconnaissance."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"By this means, I felt mutual suspicions could be allayed and an atmosphere developed in which negotiations looking toward limitation of arms would have improved chances of success."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the United Nations Subcommittee on Disarmament last fall, this proposal was explored and the United States also declared itself willing to include reciprocal ground inspection of key points."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"By the overwhelming vote of 56 to 7, the United Nations on December 16 endorsed these proposals and gave them a top priority."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thereby, the issue is placed squarely before the bar of world opinion."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall persevere in seeking a general reduction of armaments under effective inspection and control which are essential safeguards to ensure reciprocity and protect the security of all.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In the coming year much remains to be done.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"While maintaining our military deterrent, we must intensify our efforts to achieve a just peace."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In Asia we shall continue to give help to nations struggling to maintain their freedom against the threat of Communist coercion or subversion.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In Europe we shall endeavor to increase not only the military strength of the North Atlantic Alliance but also its political cohesion and unity of purpose.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall give such assistance as is feasible to the recently renewed effort of Western European nations to achieve a greater measure of integration, such as in the field of peaceful uses of atomic energy."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the Near East we shall spare no effort in seeking to promote a fair solution of the tragic dispute between the Arab States and Israel, all of whom we want as our friends."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The United States is ready to do its part to assure enduring peace in that area.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We hope that both sides will make the contributions necessary to achieve that purpose.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In Latin America, we shall continue to cooperate vigorously in trade and other measures designed to assist economic progress in the area."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Strong economic ties are an essential element in our free world partnership.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Increasing trade and investment help all of us prosper together.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Gratifying progress has been made in this direction, most recently by the three-year extension of our trade agreements legislation."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I most earnestly request that the Congress approve our membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation, which would assist the carrying out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to which we have been a party since 1948."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our membership in the OTC will provide the most effective and expeditious means for removing discriminations and restrictions against American exports and in making our trade agreements truly reciprocal.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,United States membership in the Organization will evidence our continuing desire to cooperate in promoting an expanded trade among the free nations.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thus the Organization, as proposed, is admirably suited to our own interests and to those of like-minded nations in working for steady expansion of trade and closer economic cooperation."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Being strictly an administrative entity, the Organization for Trade Cooperation cannot, of course, alter the control by Congress of the tariff, import, and customs policies of the United States."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We need to encourage investment overseas by avoiding unfair tax duplications, and to foster foreign trade by further simplification and improvement of our customs legislation."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must sustain and fortify our Mutual Security Program.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because the conditions of poverty and unrest in less developed areas make their people a special target of international communism, there is a need to help them achieve the economic growth and stability necessary to preserve their independence against communist threats and enticements."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In order that our friends may better achieve the greater strength that is our common goal, they need assurance of continuity in economic assistance for development projects and programs which we approve and which require a period of years for planning and completion."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Accordingly, I ask Congress to grant limited authority to make longer-term commitments for assistance to such projects, to be fulfilled from appropriations to be made in future fiscal years."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,These various steps will powerfully strengthen the economic foundation of our foreign policy.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Together with constructive action abroad, they will maintain the present momentum toward general economic progress and vitality of the free world."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In all things, change is the inexorable law of life."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In much of the world the ferment of change is working strongly; but grave injustices are still uncorrected.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must not, by any sanction of ours, help to perpetuate these wrongs."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I have particularly in mind the oppressive division of the German people, the bondage of millions elsewhere, and the exclusion of Japan from United Nations membership."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall keep these injustices in the forefront of human consciousness and seek to maintain the pressure of world opinion to right these vast wrongs in the interest both of justice and secure peace.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Injustice thrives on ignorance.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because an understanding of the truth about America is one of our most powerful forces, I am recommending a substantial increase in budgetary support of the United States Information Agency."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The sum of our international effort should be this: the waging of peace, with as much resourcefulness, with as great a sense of dedication and urgency, as we have ever mustered in defense of our country in time of war."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this effort, our weapon is not force."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our weapons are the principles and ideas embodied in our historic traditions, applied with the same vigor that in the past made America a living promise of freedom for all mankind."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To accomplish these vital tasks, all of us should be concerned with the strength, effectiveness and morale of our State Department and our Foreign Service."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Another guide in the preparation of the Administration's program is: THE CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY Because peace is the keystone of our national policy, our defense program emphasizes an effective flexible type of power calculated to deter or repulse any aggression and to preserve the peace."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Short of war, we have never had military strength better adapted to our needs with improved readiness for emergency use."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The maintenance of this strong military capability for the indefinite future will continue to call for a large share of our national budget.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our military programs must meet the needs of today.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,To build less would expose the nation to aggression.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To build excessively, under the influence of fear, could defeat our purposes and impair or destroy the very freedom and economic system our military defenses are designed to protect."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have improved the effectiveness and combat readiness of our forces by developing and making operational new weapons and by integrating the latest scientific developments, including new atomic weapons, into our military plans."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We continue to push the production of the most modern military aircraft.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The development of long-range missiles has been on an accelerated basis for some time.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We are moving as rapidly as practicable toward nuclear-powered aircraft and ships.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Combat capability, especially in terms of firepower, has been substantially increased."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have made the adjustments in personnel permitted by the cessation of the Korean War, the buildup of our allies and the introduction of new weapons."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The services are all planning realistically on a long-term basis.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To strengthen our continental defenses the United States and Canada, in the closest cooperation, have substantially augmented early warning networks."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Great progress is being made in extending surveillance of the Arctic, the Atlantic and the Pacific approaches to North America."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the last analysis our real strength lies in the caliber of the men and women in our Armed Forces, active and Reserve."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Much has been done to attract and hold capable military personnel, but more needs to be done."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This year, I renew my request of last year for legislation to provide proper medical care for military dependents and a more equitable survivors' benefit program."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Administration will prepare additional recommendations designed to achieve the same objectives, including career incentives for medical and dental officers and nurses, and increases in the proportion of regular officers."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Closely related to the mission of the Defense Department is the task of the Federal Civil Defense Administration.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"A particular point of relationship arises from the fact that the key to civil defense is the expanded continental defense program, including the distant early warning system."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our Federal civil defense authorities have made progress in their program, and now comprehensive studies are being conducted jointly by the Federal Civil Defense Administration, the States, and critical target case of an atomic attack."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must strengthen Federal assistance to the States and cities in devising the most effective common defense.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We have a broad and diversified mobilization base.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have the facilities, materials, skills and knowledge rapidly to expand the production of things we need for our defense whenever they are required."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,But mobilization base requirements change with changing technology and strategy.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must maintain flexibility to meet new requirements.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am requesting, therefore, that the Congress once again extend the Defense Production Act."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Of great importance to our nation's security is a continuing alertness to internal subversive activity within or without our government.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This Administration will not relax its efforts to deal forthrightly and vigorously in protection of this government and its citizens against subversion, at the same time fully protecting the constitutional rights of all citizens."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"A third objective of the Administration is: FISCAL INTEGRITY A public office is, indeed, a public trust."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,None of its aspects is more demanding than the proper management of the public finances.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I refer now not only to the indispensable virtues of plain honesty and trustworthiness but also to the prudent, effective and conscientious use of tax money."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I refer also to the attitude of mind that makes efficient and economical service to the people a watchword in our government.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Over the long term, a balanced budget is a sure index to thrifty management--in a home, in a business or in the Federal Government."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"When achievement of a balanced budget is for long put off in a business or home, bankruptcy is the result."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,But in similar circumstances a government resorts to inflation of the money supply.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This inevitably results in depreciation of the value of the money, and an increase in the cost of living."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Every investment in personal security is threatened by this process of inflation, and the real values of the people's savings, whether in the form of insurance, bonds, pension and retirement funds or savings accounts are thereby shriveled."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We have made long strides these past three years in bringing our Federal finances under control.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The deficit for fiscal year 1953 was almost 9 1/2 billion dollars.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Larger deficits seemed certain--deficits which would have depreciated the value of the dollar and pushed the cost of living still higher.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,But government waste and extravagance were searched out.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Nonessential activities were dropped.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Government expenses were carefully scrutinized.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Total spending was cut by 14 billion dollars below the amount planned by the previous Administration for the fiscal year 1954.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This made possible--and it was appropriate in the existing circumstances of transition to a peacetime economy--the largest tax cut in any year in our history.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Almost 7 1/2 billion dollars were released and every taxpayer in the country benefited.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Almost two-thirds of the savings went directly to individuals.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This tax cut also helped to build up the economy, to make jobs in industry and to increase the production of the many things desired to improve the scale of living for the great majority of Americans."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The strong expansion of the economy, coupled with a constant care for efficiency in government operations and an alert guard against waste and duplication, has brought us to a prospective balance between income and expenditure."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This is being done while we continue to strengthen our military security.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I expect the budget to be in balance during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall propose a balanced budget for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1957."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,But the balance we are seeking cannot be accomplished without the continuing every-day effort of the Executive and Legislative Branches to keep expenditures under control.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,It will also be necessary to continue all of the present excise taxes without any reduction and the corporation income taxes at their present rates for another year beyond next April 1st.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is unquestionably true that our present tax level is very burdensome and, in the interest of long term and continuous economic growth, should be reduced when we prudently can."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is essential, in the sound management of the Government's finances, that we be mindful of our enormous national debt and of the obligation we have toward future Americans to reduce that debt whenever we can appropriately do so."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Under conditions of high peacetime prosperity, such as now exist, we can never justify going further into debt to give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our children."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"So, in the present state of our financial affairs, I earnestly believe that a tax cut can be deemed justifiable only when it will not unbalance the budget, a budget which makes provision for some reduction, even though modest, in our national debt."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In this way we can best maintain fiscal integrity.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"A fourth aim of our program is: TO FOSTER A STRONG ECONOMY Our competitive enterprise system depends on the energy of free human beings, limited by prudent restraints in law, using free markets to plan, organize and distribute production, and spurred by the prospect of reward for successful effort."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This system has developed our resources.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,It has marvelously expanded our productive capacity.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Against the record of all other economic systems devised through the ages, this competitive system has proved the most creative user of human skills in the development of physical resources, and the richest rewarder of human effort."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This is still true in this era when improved living standards and rising national requirements are accompanied by swift advances in technology and rapid obsolescence in machines and methods.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Typical of these are the strides made in construction of plants to produce electrical energy from atomic power and of laboratories and installations for the application of this new force in industry, agriculture and the healing arts."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,These developments make it imperative--to assure effective functioning of our enterprise system--that the Federal Government concern itself with certain broad areas of our economic life.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Most important of these is: Agriculture Our farm people are not sharing as they should in the general prosperity.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,They alone of all major groups have seen their incomes decline rather than rise.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,They are caught between two millstones-- rising production costs and declining prices.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Such harm to a part of the national economy so vitally important to everyone is of great concern to us all.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,No other resource is so indispensable as the land that feeds and clothes us.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,No group is more fundamental to our national life than our farmers.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In successful prosecution of the war, the nation called for the utmost effort of its farmers."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Their response was superb, their contribution unsurpassed."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Farmers are not now to be blamed for the mountainous, price-depressing surpluses produced in response to wartime policies and laws that were too long continued."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,War markets are not the markets of peacetime.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Failure to recognize that basic fact by a timely adjustment of wartime legislation brought its inevitable result in peacetime--surpluses, lower prices and lower incomes for our farmers."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The dimensions of government responsibility are as broad and complex as the farm problem itself.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We are here concerned not only with our essential continuing supplies of food and fiber, but also with a way of life."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Both are indispensable to the well-being and strength of the nation.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Consideration of these matters must be above and beyond politics.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our national farm policy, so vital to the welfare of farm people and all of us, must not become a field for political warfare."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Too much is at stake.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our farm people expect of us, who have responsibility for their government, understanding of their problems and the will to help solve them."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our objective must be to help bring production into balance with existing and new markets, at prices that yield farmers a return for their work in line with what other Americans get."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To reach this goal, deep-seated problems must be subjected to a stepped-up attack."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,There is no single easy solution.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Rather, there must be a many-sided assault on the stubborn problems of surpluses, prices, costs, and markets; and a steady, persistent, imaginative advance in the relationship between farmers and their government."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In a few days, by special message, I shall lay before the Congress my detailed recommendations for new steps that should be taken promptly to speed the transition in agriculture and thus assist our farmers to achieve their fair share of the national income."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Basic to this program will be a new attack on the surplus problem-- for even the best-conceived farm program cannot work under a multi-billion dollar weight of accumulated stocks.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall urge authorization of a soil bank program to alleviate the problem of diverted acres and an overexpanded agricultural plant.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This will include an acreage reserve to reduce current and accumulated surpluses of crops in most serious difficulty, and a conservation reserve to achieve other needed adjustments in the use of agricultural resources."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall urge measures to strengthen our surplus disposal activities.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall propose measures to strengthen individual commodity programs, to remove controls where possible, to reduce carryovers, and to stop further accumulations of surpluses."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall ask the Congress to provide substantial new funds for an expanded drive on the research front, to develop new markets, new crops, and new uses."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Rural Development Program to better the lot of low-income farm families deserves full Congressional support.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Great Plains Program must go forward vigorously.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Advances on these and other fronts will pull down the price-depressing surpluses and raise farm income.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this time of testing in agriculture, we should all together, regardless of party, carry forward resolutely with a sound and forward looking program on which farm people may confidently depend, now and for years to come."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall briefly mention four other subjects directly related to the well-being of the economy, preliminary to their fuller discussion in the Economic Report and later communications."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Resources Conservation I wish to re-emphasize the critical importance of the wise use and conservation of our great natural resources of land, forests, minerals and water and their long-range development consistent with our agricultural policy."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Water in particular now plays an increasing role in industrial processes, in the irrigation of land, in electric power, as well as in domestic uses."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"At the same time, it has the potential of damage and disaster."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,A comprehensive legislative program for water conservation will be submitted to the Congress during the Session.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The development of our water resources cannot be accomplished overnight.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The need is such that we must make faster progress and without delay.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Therefore, I strongly recommend that action be taken at this Session on such wholly Federal projects as the Colorado River Storage Project and the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project; on the John Day partnership project, and other projects which provide for cooperative action between the Federal Government and non-Federal interests; and on legislation, which makes provision for Federal participation in small projects under the primary sponsorship of agencies of State and local government."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the past year the areas of our National Parks have been expanded, and new wildlife refuges have been created."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The visits of our people to the Parks have increased much more rapidly than have the facilities to care for them.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Administration will submit recommendations to provide more adequate facilities to keep abreast of the increasing interest of our people in the great outdoors.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Disaster Assistance A modern community is a complex combination of skills, specialized buildings, machines, communications and homes."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Most importantly, it involves human lives."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Disaster in many forms--by flood, frost, high winds, for instance--can destroy on a massive scale in a few hours the labor of many years."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Through the past three years the Administration has repeatedly moved into action wherever disaster struck.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The extent of State participation in relief activities, however, has been far from uniform and, in many cases, has been either inadequate or nonexistent."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Disaster assistance legislation requires overhauling and an experimental program of flood-damage indemnities should be undertaken.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Administration will make detailed recommendations on these subjects.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Area Redevelopment We must help deal with the pockets of chronic unemployment that here and there mar the nation's general industrial prosperity.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Economic changes in recent years have been often so rapid and far-reaching that areas committed to a single local resource or industrial activity have found themselves temporarily deprived of their markets and their livelihood.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Such conditions mean severe hardship for thousands of people as the slow process of adaptation to new circumstances goes on.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This process can be speeded up.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Last year I authorized a major study of the problem to find additional steps to supplement existing programs for the redevelopment of areas of chronic unemployment.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Recommendations will be submitted, designed to supplement, with Federal technical and loan assistance local efforts to get on with this vital job."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Improving such communities must, of course, remain the primary responsibility of the people living there and of their States."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,But a soundly conceived Federal partnership program can be of real assistance to them in their efforts.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Highway Legislation Legislation to provide a modern, interstate highway system is even more urgent this year than last, for 12 months have now passed in which we have fallen further behind in road construction needed for the personal safety, the general prosperity, the national security of the American people."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the year, the number of motor vehicles has increased from 58 to 61 million."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the past year over 38,000 persons lost their lives in highway accidents, while the fearful toll of injuries and property damage has gone on unabated."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In my message of February 22, 1955, I urged that measures be taken to complete the vital 40,000 mile interstate system over a period of 10 years at an estimated Federal cost of approximately 25 billion dollars."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,No program was adopted.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we are ever to solve our mounting traffic problem, the whole interstate system must be authorized as one project, to be completed approximately within the specified time."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Only in this way can industry efficiently gear itself to the job ahead.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Only in this way can the required planning and engineering be accomplished without the confusion and waste unavoidable in a piecemeal approach.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Furthermore, as I pointed out last year, the pressing nature of this problem must not lead us to solutions outside the bounds of sound fiscal management."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"As in the case of other pressing problems, there must be an adequate plan of financing."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To continue the drastically needed improvement in other national highway systems, I recommend the continuation of the Federal Aid Highway Program."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Aside from agriculture and the four subjects specifically mentioned, an integral part of our efforts to foster a strong and expanding free economy is keeping open the door of opportunity to new and small enterprises, checking monopoly, and preserving a competitive environment."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In this past year the steady improvement in the economic health of small business has reinforced the vitality of our competitive economy.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall continue to help small business concerns to obtain access to adequate financing and to competent counsel on management, production, and marketing problems."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through measures already taken, opportunities for small-business participation in government procurement programs, including military procurement, are greatly improved."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The effectiveness of these measures will become increasingly apparent.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We shall continue to make certain that small business has a fair opportunity to compete and has an economic environment in which it may prosper.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,In my message last year I referred to the appointment of an advisory committee to appraise and report to me on the deficiencies as well as the effectiveness of existing Federal transportation policies.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I have commended the fundamental purposes and objectives of the committee's report.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I earnestly recommend that the Congress give prompt attention to the committee's proposals.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Essential to a prosperous economic environment for all business, small and large--for agriculture and industry and commerce--is efficiency in Government."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To that end, exhaustive studies of the entire governmental structure were made by the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and the Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government--the reports of these Commissions are now under intensive review and already in the process of implementation in important areas."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,One specific and most vital governmental function merits study and action by the Congress.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"As part of our program of promoting efficiency in Government and getting the fiscal situation in hand, the Post Office Department in the past three years has been overhauled."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Nearly one thousand new post offices have been provided.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Financial practices have been modernized, and transportation and operating methods are being constantly improved."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,A new wage and incentive plan for the half million postal employees has been established.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Never before has the postal system handled so much mail so quickly and so economically.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Post Office Department faces two serious problems.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, much of its physical plant--post offices and other buildings--is obsolete and inadequate."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Many new buildings and the modernization of present ones are essential if we are to have improved mail service.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The second problem is the Department's fiscal plight.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,It now faces an annual deficit of one-half billion dollars.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Recommendations on postal facilities and on additional postal revenues will be submitted to the Congress.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,A final consideration in our program planning is: THE RESPONSE TO HUMAN CONCERNS A fundamental belief shines forth in this Republic.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We believe in the worth and dignity of the individual.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We know that if we are to govern ourselves wisely--in the tradition of America--we must have the opportunity to develop our individual capacities to the utmost.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To fulfill the individual's aspirations in the American way of life, good education is fundamental."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Good education is the outgrowth of good homes, good communities, good churches, and good schools."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Today our schools face pressing problems--problems which will not yield to swift and easy solutions, or to any single action."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"They will yield only to a continuing, active, informed effort by the people toward achieving better schools."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"This kind of effort has been spurred by the thousands of conferences held in recent months by half a million citizens and educators in all parts of the country, culminating in the White House Conference on Education."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In that Conference, some two thousand delegates, broadly representative of the nation, studied together the problems of the nation's schools."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"They concluded that the people of the United States must make a greater effort through their local, State, and Federal Governments to improve the education of our youth."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This expression from the people must now be translated into action at all levels of government.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"So far as the Federal share of responsibility is concerned, I urge that the Congress move promptly to enact an effective program of Federal assistance to help erase the existing deficit of school classrooms."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such a program, which should be limited to a five-year period, must operate to increase rather than decrease local and State support of schools and to give the greatest help to the States and localities with the least financial resources."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Federal aid should in no way jeopardize the freedom of local school systems.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,There will be presented to the Congress a recommended program of Federal assistance for school construction.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Such a program should be accompanied by action to increase services to the nation's schools by the Office of Education and by legislation to provide continuation of payments to school districts where Federal activities have impaired the ability of those districts to provide adequate schools.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Under the 1954 Amendments to the old-age and survivors' insurance program, protection was extended to some 10 million additional workers and benefits were increased."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The system now helps protect 9 out of 10 American workers and their families against loss of income in old age or on the death of the breadwinner.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The system is sound.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,It must be kept so.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In developing improvements in the system, we must give the most careful consideration to population and social trends, and to fiscal requirements."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"With these considerations in mind, the Administration will present its recommendations for further expansion of coverage and other steps which can be taken wisely at this time."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Other needs in the area of social welfare include increased child welfare services, extension of the program of aid to dependent children, intensified attack on juvenile delinquency, and special attention to the problems of mentally retarded children."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The training of more skilled workers for these fields and the quest for new knowledge through research in social welfare are essential.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Similarly the problems of our aged people need our attention.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The nation has made dramatic progress in conquering disease-- progress of profound human significance which can be greatly accelerated by an intensified effort in medical research.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"A well-supported, well-balanced program of research, including basic research, can open new frontiers of knowledge, prevent and relieve suffering, and prolong life."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Accordingly I shall recommend a substantial increase in Federal funds for the support of such a program.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"As an integral part of this effort, I shall recommend a new plan to aid construction of non-Federal medical research and teaching facilities and to help provide more adequate support for the training of medical research manpower."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Finally, we must aid in cushioning the heavy and rising costs of illness and hospitalization to individuals and families."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Provision should be made, by Federal reinsurance or otherwise, to foster extension of voluntary health insurance coverage to many more persons, especially older persons and those in rural areas."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Plans should be evolved to improve protection against the costs of prolonged or severe illness.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,These measures will help reduce the dollar barrier between many Americans and the benefits of modern medical care.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Administration health program will be submitted to the Congress in detail.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The response of government to human concerns embraces, of course, other measures of broad public interest, and of special interest to our working men and women."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The need still exists for improvement of the Labor Management Relations Act.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The recommendations I submitted to the Congress last year take into account not only the interests of labor and management but also the public welfare.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The needed amendments should be enacted without further delay.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must also carry forward the job of improving the wage-hour law.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Last year I requested the Congress to broaden the coverage of the minimum wage.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I repeat that recommendation, and I pledge the full resources of the Executive Branch to assist the Congress in finding ways to attain this goal."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, as requested last year, legislation should be passed to clarify and strengthen the eight-hour laws for the benefit of workers who are subject to Federal wage standards on Federal and Federally-assisted construction and other public works."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Administration will shortly propose legislation to assure adequate disclosure of the financial affairs of each employee pension and welfare plan and to afford substantial protection to their beneficiaries in accordance with the objectives outlined in my message of January 11, 1954."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Occupational safety still demands attention, as I pointed out last year, and legislation to improve the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is still needed."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The improvement of the District of Columbia Unemployment Insurance Law and legislation to provide employees in the District with non-occupational disability insurance are no less necessary now than 12 months ago.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislation to apply the principle of equal pay for equal work without discrimination because of sex is a matter of simple justice.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I earnestly urge the Congress to move swiftly to implement these needed labor measures.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the field of human needs, we must carry forward the housing program, which is contributing so greatly to the well-being of our people and the prosperity of our economy."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Home ownership is now advanced to the point where almost three of every five families in our cities, towns, and suburbs own the houses they live in."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"For the housing program, most of the legislative authority already exists."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, a firm program of public housing is essential until the private building industry has found ways to provide more adequate housing for low-income families."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Administration will propose authority to contract for 35 thousand additional public housing units in each of the next 2 fiscal years for communities which will participate in an integrated attack on slums and blight.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To meet the needs of the growing number of older people, several amendments to the National Housing Act will be proposed to assist the private homebuilding industry as well as charitable and non-profit organizations."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"With so large a number of the American people desiring to modernize and improve existing dwellings, I recommend that the Title I program for permanent improvements in the home be liberalized."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I recommend increases in the general FHA mortgage insurance authority; the extension of the FHA military housing program; an increase in the authorization for Urban Planning grants; in the special assistance authority of the Federal National Mortgage Association; and continued support of the college housing program in a way that will not discourage private capital from helping to meet the needs of our colleges.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The legislation I have recommended for workers in private industry should be accompanied by a parallel effort for the welfare of Government employees.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have accomplished much in this field, including a contributory life insurance program; equitable pay increases and a fringe benefits program, covering many needed personnel policy changes, from improved premium pay to a meaningful incentive award program."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Additional personnel management legislation is needed in this Session.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"As I stated last year, an executive pay increase is essential to efficient governmental management."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such an increase, together with needed adjustments in the pay for the top career positions, is also necessary to the equitable completion of the Federal pay program initiated last year."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Other legislation will be proposed, including legislation for prepaid group health insurance for employees and their dependents and to effect major improvements in the Civil Service retirement system."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,All of us share a continuing concern for those who have served this nation in the Armed Forces.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The Commission on Veterans Pensions is at this time conducting a study of the entire field of veterans' benefits and will soon submit proposed improvements.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We are proud of the progress our people have made in the field of civil rights.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In Executive Branch operations throughout the nation, elimination of discrimination and segregation is all but completed."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Progress is also being made among contractors engaged in furnishing Government services and requirements.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Every citizen now has the opportunity to fit himself for and to hold a position of responsibility in the service of his country.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the District of Columbia, through the voluntary cooperation of the people, discrimination and segregation are disappearing from hotels, theaters, restaurants and other facilities."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,It is disturbing that in some localities allegations persist that Negro citizens are being deprived of their right to vote and are likewise being subjected to unwarranted economic pressures.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I recommend that the substance of these charges be thoroughly examined by a Bipartisan Commission created by the Congress.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,It is hoped that such a commission will be established promptly so that it may arrive at findings which can receive early consideration.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The stature of our leadership in the free world has increased through the past three years because we have made more progress than ever before in a similar period to assure our citizens equality in justice, in opportunity and in civil rights."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must expand this effort on every front.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must strive to have every person judged and measured by what he is, rather than by his color, race or religion."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"There will soon be recommended to the Congress a program further to advance the efforts of the Government, within the area of Federal responsibility, to accomplish these objectives."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,One particular challenge confronts us.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the Hawaiian Islands, East meets West."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To the Islands, Asia and Europe and the Western Hemisphere, all the continents, have contributed their peoples and their cultures to display a unique example of a community that is a successful laboratory in human brotherhood."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Statehood, supported by the repeatedly expressed desire of the Islands' people and by our traditions, would be a shining example of the American way to the entire earth."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Consequently, I urgently request this Congress to grant statehood for Hawaii."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Also, in harmony with the provisions I last year communicated to the Senate and House Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs, I trust that progress toward statehood for Alaska can be made in this Session."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Progress is constant toward full integration of our Indian citizens into normal community life.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,During the past two years the Administration has provided school facilities for thousands of Indian children previously denied this opportunity.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We must continue to meet the needs of increased numbers of Indian children.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Provision should also be made for the education of adult Indians whose schooling in earlier years was neglected.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"In keeping with our responsibility of world leadership and in our own self interest, I again point out to the Congress the urgent need for revision of the immigration and nationality laws."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our nation has always welcomed immigrants to our shores.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The wisdom of such a policy is clearly shown by the fact that America has been built by immigrants and the descendants of immigrants.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,That policy must be continued realistically with present day conditions in mind.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I recommend that the number of persons admitted to this country annually be based not on the 1920 census but on the latest, the 1950 census."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Provision should be made to allow for greater flexibility in the use of quotas so if one country does not use its share, the vacancies may be made available for the use of qualified individuals from other countries."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,The law should be amended to permit the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to waive the requirements of fingerprinting on a reciprocal basis for persons coming to this country for temporary visits.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This and other changes in the law are long overdue and should be taken care of promptly.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Detailed recommendations for revision of the immigration laws will be submitted to the Congress.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am happy to report substantial progress in the flow of immigrants under the Refugee Relief Act of 1953; however, I again request this Congress to approve without further delay the urgently needed amendments to that act which I submitted in the last Session."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because of the high prosperity in Germany and Austria, the number of immigrants from those countries will be reduced."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,This will make available thousands of unfilled openings which I recommend be distributed to Greece and Italy and to escapees from behind the Iron Curtain.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Once again I ask the Congress to join with me in demonstrating our belief in the right of suffrage.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,I renew my request that the principle of self-government be extended and the right of suffrage granted to the citizens of the District of Columbia.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,To conclude: the vista before us is bright.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"The march of science, the expanding economy, the advance in collective security toward a just peace--in this threefold movement our people are creating new standards by which the future of the Republic may be judged."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Progress, however, will be realized only as it is more than matched by a continuing growth in the spiritual strength of the nation."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,Our dedication to moral values must be complete in our dealings abroad and in our relationships among ourselves.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,We have single-minded devotion to the common good of America.
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"Never must we forget that this means the well-being, the prosperity, the security of all Americans in every walk of life."
1956,Eisenhower,Republican,"To the attainment of these objectives, I pledge full energies of the Administration, as in the Session ahead, it works on a program for submission to you, the Congress of the United States."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION I appear before the Congress today to report on the State of the Union and the relationships of the Union to the other nations of the world.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"I come here, firmly convinced that at no time in the history of the Republic have circumstances more emphatically underscored the need, in all echelons of government, for vision and wisdom and resolution."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,You meet in a season of stress that is testing the fitness of political systems and the validity of political philosophies.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Each stress stems in part from causes peculiar to itself.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,But every stress is a reflection of a universal phenomenon.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the world today, the surging and understandable tide of nationalism is marked by widespread revulsion and revolt against tyranny, injustice, inequality and poverty."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"As individuals, joined in a common hunger for freedom, men and women and even children pit their spirit against guns and tanks."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"On a larger scale, in an ever more persistent search for the self-respect of authentic sovereignty and the economic base on which national independence must rest, peoples sever old ties; seek new alliances; experiment--sometimes dangerously--in their struggle to satisfy these human aspirations."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Particularly, in the past year, this tide has changed the pattern of attitudes and thinking among millions."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The changes already accomplished foreshadow a world transformed by the spirit of freedom.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This is no faint and pious hope.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The forces now at work in the minds and hearts of men will not be spent through many years.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the main, today's expressions of nationalism are, in spirit, echoes of our forefathers' struggle for independence."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This Republic cannot be aloof to these events heralding a new epoch in the affairs of mankind.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our pledged word, our enlightened self-interest, our character as a Nation commit us to a high role in world affairs: a role of vigorous leadership, ready strength, sympathetic understanding."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"The State of the Union, at the opening of the 85th Congress, continues to vindicate the wisdom of the principles on which this Republic is founded."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Proclaimed in the Constitution of the Nation and in many of our historic documents, and founded in devout religious convictions, these principles enunciate: A vigilant regard for human liberty."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,A wise concern for human welfare.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,A ceaseless effort for human progress.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fidelity to these principles, in our relations with other peoples, has won us new friendships and has increased our opportunity for service within the family of nations."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"The appeal of these principles is universal, lighting fires in the souls of men everywhere."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"We shall continue to uphold them, against those who deny them and in counselling with our friends."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"At home, the application of these principles to the complex problems of our national life has brought us to an unprecedented peak in our economic prosperity and has exemplified in our way of life the enduring human values of mind and spirit."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Through the past four years these principles have guided the legislative programs submitted by the Administration to the Congress.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"As we attempt to apply them to current events, domestic and foreign, we must take into account the complex entity that is the United States of America; what endangers it; what can improve it."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The visible structure is our American economy itself.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"After more than a century and a half of constant expansion, it is still rich in a wide variety of natural resources."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is first among nations in its people's mastery of industrial skills.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is productive beyond our own needs of many foodstuffs and industrial products.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is rewarding to all our citizens in opportunity to earn and to advance in self-realization and in self-expression.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is fortunate in its wealth of educational and cultural and religious centers.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is vigorously dynamic in the limitless initiative and willingness to venture that characterize free enterprise.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is productive of a widely shared prosperity.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our economy is strong, expanding, and fundamentally sound."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"But in any realistic appraisal, even the optimistic analyst will realize that in a prosperous period the principal threat to efficient functioning of a free enterprise system is inflation."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"We look back on four years of prosperous activities during which prices, the cost of living, have been relatively stable--that is, inflation has been held in check."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"But it is clear that the danger is always present, particularly if the government might become profligate in its expenditures or private groups might ignore all the possible results on our economy of unwise struggles for immediate gain."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"This danger requires a firm resolution that the Federal Government shall utilize only a prudent share of the Nation's resources, that it shall live within its means, carefully measuring against need alternative proposals for expenditures."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through the next four years, I shall continue to insist that the executive departments and agencies of Government search out additional ways to save money and manpower."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge that the Congress be equally watchful in this matter.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,We pledge the Government's share in guarding the integrity of the dollar.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"But the Government's efforts cannot be the entire campaign against inflation, the thief that can rob the individual of the value of the pension and social security he has earned during his productive life."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"For success, Government's efforts must be paralleled by the attitudes and actions of individual citizens."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I have often spoken of the purpose of this Administration to serve the national interest of 170 million people.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The national interest must take precedence over temporary advantages which may be secured by particular groups at the expense of all the people.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,In this regard I call on leaders in business and in labor to think well on their responsibility to the American people.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"With all elements of our society, they owe the Nation a vigilant guard against the inflationary tendencies that are always at work in a dynamic economy operating at today's high levels."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,They can powerfully help counteract or accentuate such tendencies by their wage and price policies.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Business in its pricing policies should avoid unnecessary price increases especially at a time like the present when demand in so many areas presses hard on short supplies.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,A reasonable profit is essential to the new investments that provide more jobs in an expanding economy.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"But business leaders must, in the national interest, studiously avoid those price rises that are possible only because of vital or unusual needs of the whole nation."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"If our economy is to remain healthy, increases in wages and other labor benefits, negotiated by labor and management, must be reasonably related to improvements in productivity."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such increases are beneficial, for they provide wage earners with greater purchasing power."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Except where necessary to correct obvious injustices, wage increases that outrun productivity, however, are an inflationary factor."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,They make for higher prices for the public generally and impose a particular hardship on those whose welfare depends on the purchasing power of retirement income and savings.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Wage negotiations should also take cognizance of the right of the public generally to share in the benefits of improvements in technology.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Freedom has been defined as the opportunity for self-discipline.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This definition has a special application to the areas of wage and price policy in a free economy.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Should we persistently fail to discipline ourselves, eventually there will be increasing pressure on government to redress the failure."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,By that process freedom will step by step disappear.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,No subject on the domestic scene should more attract the concern of the friends of American working men and women and of free business enterprise than the forces that threaten a steady depreciation of the value of our money.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Concerning developments in another vital sector of our economy-- agriculture--I am gratified that the long slide in farm income has been halted and that further improvement is in prospect.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This is heartening progress.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Three tools that we have developed--improved surplus disposal, improved price support laws, and the soil bank--are working to reduce price-depressing government stocks of farm products."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Our concern for the well-being of farm families demands that we constantly search for new ways by which they can share more fully in our unprecedented prosperity.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislative recommendations in the field of agriculture are contained in the Budget Message.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our soil, water, mineral, forest, fish, and wildlife resources are being conserved and improved more effectively."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Their conservation and development are vital to the present and future strength of the Nation.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,But they must not be the concern of the Federal Government alone.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"State and local entities, and private enterprise should be encouraged to participate in such projects."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"I would like to make special mention of programs for making the best uses of water, rapidly becoming our most precious natural resource, just as it can be, when neglected, a destroyer of both life and wealth."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,There has been prepared and published a comprehensive water report developed by a Cabinet Committee and relating to all phases of this particular problem.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the light of this report, there are two things I believe we should keep constantly in mind."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The first is that each of our great river valleys should be considered as a whole.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Piecemeal operations within each lesser drainage area can be self-defeating or, at the very least, needlessly expensive."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The second is that the domestic and industrial demands for water grow far more rapidly than does our population.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"The whole matter of making the best use of each drop of water from the moment it touches our soil until it reaches the oceans, for such purposes as irrigation, flood control, power production, and domestic and industrial uses clearly demands the closest kind of cooperation and partnership between municipalities, States and the Federal Government."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through partnership of Federal, state and local authorities in these vast projects we can obtain the economy and efficiency of development and operation that springs from a lively sense of local responsibility."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Until such partnership is established on a proper and logical basis of sharing authority, responsibility and costs, our country will never have both the fully productive use of water that it so obviously needs and protection against disastrous flood."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we fail in this, all the many tasks that need to be done in America could be accomplished only at an excessive cost, by the growth of a stifling bureaucracy, and eventually with a dangerous degree of centralized control over our national life."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"In all domestic matters, I believe that the people of the United States will expect of us effective action to remedy past failure in meeting critical needs."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,High priority should be given the school construction bill.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This will benefit children of all races throughout the country--and children of all races need schools now.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,A program designed to meet emergency needs for more classrooms should be enacted without delay.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am hopeful that this program can be enacted on its own merits, uncomplicated by provisions dealing with the complex problems of integration."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"I urge the people in all sections of the country to approach these problems with calm and reason, with mutual understanding and good will, and in the American tradition of deep respect for the orderly processes of law and justice."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I should say here that we have much reason to be proud of the progress our people are making in mutual understanding--the chief buttress of human and civil rights.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Steadily we are moving closer to the goal of fair and equal treatment of citizens without regard to race or color.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,But unhappily much remains to be done.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Last year the Administration recommended to the Congress a four-point program to reinforce civil rights.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,That program included: (1) creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate asserted violations of civil rights and to make recommendations; (2) creation of a civil rights division in the Department of Justice in charge of an Assistant Attorney General; (3) enactment by the Congress of new laws to aid in the enforcement of voting rights; and (4) amendment of the laws so as to permit the Federal Government to seek from the civil courts preventive relief in civil rights cases.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge that the Congress enact this legislation.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Essential to the stable economic growth we seek is a system of well-adapted and efficient financial institutions.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"I believe the time has come to conduct a broad national inquiry into the nature, performance and adequacy of our financial system, both in terms of its direct service to the whole economy and in terms of its function as the mechanism through which monetary and credit policy takes effect."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I believe the Congress should authorize the creation of a commission of able and qualified citizens to undertake this vital inquiry.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Out of their findings and recommendations the Administration would develop and present to the Congress any legislative proposals that might be indicated for the purpose of improving our financial machinery.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this message it seems unnecessary that I should repeat recommendations involving our domestic affairs that have been urged upon the Congress during the past four years, but which, in some instances, did not reach the stage of completely satisfactory legislation."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Administration will, through future messages either directly from me or from heads of the departments and agencies, transmit to the Congress specific recommendations."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"These will involve our financial and fiscal affairs; our military and civil defenses; the administration of justice; our agricultural economy; our domestic and foreign commerce; the urgently needed increase in our postal rates; the development of our natural resources; our labor laws, including our labor-management relations legislation, and vital aspects of the health, education and welfare of our people."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"There will be special recommendations dealing with such subjects as atomic energy, the furthering of public works, the continued efforts to eliminate government competition with the businesses of tax-paying citizens."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"A number of legislative recommendations will be mentioned specifically in my forthcoming Budget Message, which will reach you within the week."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,That message will also recommend such sums as are needed to implement the proposed action.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Turning to the international scene: The existence of a strongly armed imperialistic dictatorship poses a continuing threat to the free world's and thus to our own Nation's security and peace.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,There are certain truths to be remembered here.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, America alone and isolated cannot assure even its own security."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,We must be joined by the capability and resolution of nations that have proved themselves dependable defenders of freedom.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Isolation from them invites war.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our security is also enhanced by the immeasurable interest that joins us with all peoples who believe that peace with justice must be preserved, that wars of aggression are crimes against humanity."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Another truth is that our survival in today's world requires modern, adequate, dependable military strength."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our Nation has made great strides in assuring a modern defense, so armed in new weapons, so deployed, so equipped, that today our security force is the most powerful in our peacetime history."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It can punish heavily any enemy who undertakes to attack us.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,It is a major deterrent to war.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,By our research and development more efficient weapons--some of amazing capabilities--are being constantly created.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,These vital efforts we shall continue.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet we must not delude ourselves that safety necessarily increases as expenditures for military research or forces in being go up.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Indeed, beyond a wise and reasonable level, which is always changing and is under constant study, money spent on arms may be money wasted on sterile metal or inflated costs, thereby weakening the very security and strength we seek."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,National security requires far more than military power.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Economic and moral factors play indispensable roles.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Any program that endangers our economy could defeat us.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Any weakening of our national will and resolution, any diminution of the vigor and initiative of our individual citizens, would strike a blow at the heart of our defenses."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The finest military establishment we can produce must work closely in cooperation with the forces of our friends.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our system of regional pacts, developed within the Charter of the United Nations, serves to increase both our own security and the security of other nations."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This system is still a recent introduction on the world scene.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Its problems are many and difficult, because it insists on equality among its members and brings into association some nations traditionally divided."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Repeatedly in recent months, the collapse of these regional alliances has been predicted."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The strains upon them have been at times indeed severe.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Despite these strains our regional alliances have proved durable and strong, and dire predictions of their disintegration have proved completely false."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"With other free nations, we should vigorously prosecute measures that will promote mutual strength, prosperity and welfare within the free world."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Strength is essentially a product of economic health and social well-being.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Consequently, even as we continue our programs of military assistance, we must emphasize aid to our friends in building more productive economies and in better satisfying the natural demands of their people for progress."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Thereby we shall move a long way toward a peaceful world.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"A sound and safeguarded agreement for open skies, unarmed aerial sentinels, and reduced armament would provide a valuable contribution toward a durable peace in the years ahead."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,And we have been persistent in our effort to reach such an agreement.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,We are willing to enter any reliable agreement which would reverse the trend toward ever more devastating nuclear weapons; reciprocally provide against the possibility of surprise attack; mutually control the outer space missile and satellite development; and make feasible a lower level of armaments and armed forces and an easier burden of military expenditures.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Our continuing negotiations in this field are a major part of our quest for a confident peace in this atomic age.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"This quest requires as well a constructive attitude among all the nations of the free world toward expansion of trade and investment, that can give all of us opportunity to work out economic betterment."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,An essential step in this field is the provision of an administrative agency to insure the orderly and proper operation of existing arrangements under which multilateral trade is now carried on.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"To that end I urge Congressional authorization for United States membership in the proposed Organization for Trade Cooperation, an action which will speed removal of discrimination against our export trade."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,We welcome the efforts of a number of our European friends to achieve an integrated community to develop a common market.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,We likewise welcome their cooperative effort in the field of atomic energy.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"To demonstrate once again our unalterable purpose to make of the atom a peaceful servant of humanity, I shortly shall ask the Congress to authorize full United States participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,World events have magnified both the responsibilities and the opportunities of the United States Information Agency.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Just as, in recent months, the voice of communism has become more shaken and confused, the voice of truth must be more clearly heard."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"To enable our Information Agency to cope with these new responsibilities and opportunities, I am asking the Congress to increase appreciably the appropriations for this program and for legislation establishing a career service for the Agency's overseas foreign service officers."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The recent historic events in Hungary demand that all free nations share to the extent of their capabilities in the responsibility of granting asylum to victims of Communist persecution.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I request the Congress promptly to enact legislation to regularize the status in the United States of Hungarian refugees brought here as parolees.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall shortly recommend to the Congress by special message the changes in our immigration laws that I deem necessary in the light of our world responsibilities.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"The cost of peace is something we must face boldly, fearlessly."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Beyond money, it involves changes in attitudes, the renunciation of old prejudices, even the sacrifice of some seeming self-interest."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Only five days ago I expressed to you the grave concern of your Government over the threat of Soviet aggression in the Middle East.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I asked for Congressional authorization to help counter this threat.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I say again that this matter is of vital and immediate importance to the Nation's and the free world's security and peace.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"By our proposed programs in the Middle East, we hope to assist in establishing a climate in which constructive and long-term solutions to basic problems of the area may be sought."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"From time to time, there will be presented to the Congress requests for other legislation in the broad field of international affairs."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"All requests will reflect the steadfast purpose of this Administration to pursue peace, based on justice."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Although in some cases details will be new, the underlying purpose and objectives will remain the same."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,All proposals made by the Administration in this field are based on the free world's unity.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,This unity may not be immediately obvious unless we examine link by link the chain of relationships that binds us to every area and to every nation.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,In spirit the free world is one because its people uphold the right of independent existence for all nations.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,I have already alluded to their economic interdependence.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,But their interdependence extends also into the field of security.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"First of all, no reasonable man will question the absolute need for our American neighbors to be prosperous and secure."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Their security and prosperity are inextricably bound to our own.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"And we are, of course, already joined with these neighbors by historic pledges."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Again, no reasonable man will deny that the freedom and prosperity and security of Western Europe are vital to our own prosperity and security."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"If the institutions, the skills, the manpower of its peoples were to fall under the domination of an aggressive imperialism, the violent change in the balance of world power and in the pattern of world commerce could not be fully compensated for by any American measures, military or economic."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"But these people, whose economic strength is largely dependent on free and uninterrupted movement of oil from the Middle East, cannot prosper--indeed, their economies would be severely impaired--should that area be controlled by an enemy and the movement of oil be subject to its decisions."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Next, to the Eastward, are Asiatic and Far Eastern peoples, recently returned to independent control of their own affairs or now emerging into sovereign statehood."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Their potential strength constitutes new assurance for stability and peace in the world--if they can retain their independence.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Should they lose freedom and be dominated by an aggressor, the world-wide effects would imperil the security of the free world."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"In short, the world has so shrunk that all free nations are our neighbors."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Without cooperative neighbors, the United States cannot maintain its own security and welfare, because: First, America's vital interests are world-wide, embracing both hemispheres and every continent."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, we have community of interest with every nation in the free world."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, interdependence of interests requires a decent respect for the rights and the peace of all peoples."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,These principles motivate our actions within the United Nations.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"There, before all the world, by our loyalty to them, by our practice of them, let us strive to set a standard to which all who seek justice and who hunger for peace can rally."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"May we at home, here at the Seat of Government, in all the cities and towns and farmlands of America, support these principles in a personal effort of dedication."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thereby each of us can help establish a secure world order in which opportunity for freedom and justice will be more widespread, and in which the resources now dissipated on the armaments of war can be released for the life and growth of all humanity."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"When our forefathers prepared the immortal document that proclaimed our independence, they asserted that every individual is endowed by his Creator with certain inalienable rights."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"As we gaze back through history to that date, it is clear that our nation has striven to live up to this declaration, applying it to nations as well as to individuals."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"Today we proudly assert that the government of the United States is still committed to this concept, both in its activities at home and abroad."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,The purpose is Divine; the implementation is human.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,Our country and its government have made mistakes--human mistakes.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,They have been of the head--not of the heart.
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"And it is still true that the great concept of the dignity of all men, alike created in the image of the Almighty, has been the compass by which we have tried and are trying to steer our course."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"So long as we continue by its guidance, there will be true progress in human affairs, both among ourselves and among those with whom we deal."
1957,Eisenhower,Republican,"To achieve a more perfect fidelity to it, I submit, is a worthy ambition as we meet together in these first days of this, the first session of the 85th Congress."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION It is again my high privilege to extend personal greetings to the members of the 85th Congress.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"All of us realize that, as this new session begins, many Americans are troubled about recent world developments which they believe may threaten our nation's safety."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Honest men differ in their appraisal of America's material and intellectual strength, and the dangers that confront us."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But all know these dangers are real.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The purpose of this message is to outline the measures that can give the American people a confidence--just as real--in their own security.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am not here to justify the past, gloss over the problems of the present, or propose easy solutions for the future."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I am here to state what I believe to be right and what I believe to be wrong; and to propose action for correcting what I think wrong!
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,There are two tasks confronting us that so far outweigh all others that I shall devote this year's message entirely to them.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The first is to ensure our safety through strength.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As to our strength, I have repeatedly voiced this conviction: We now have a broadly based and efficient defensive strength, including a great deterrent power, which is, for the present, our main guarantee against war; but, unless we act wisely and promptly, we could lose that capacity to deter attack or defend ourselves."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"My profoundest conviction is that the American people will say, as one man: No matter what the exertions or sacrifices, we shall maintain that necessary strength!"
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But we could make no more tragic mistake than merely to concentrate on military strength.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"For if we did only this, the future would hold nothing for the world but an Age of Terror."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,And so our second task is to do the constructive work of building a genuine peace.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must never become so preoccupied with our desire for military strength that we neglect those areas of economic development, trade, diplomacy, education, ideas and principles where the foundations of real peace must be laid."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,II.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The threat to our safety, and to the hope of a peaceful world, can be simply stated."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It is communist imperialism.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This threat is not something imagined by critics of the Soviets.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Soviet spokesmen, from the beginning, have publicly and frequently declared their aim to expand their power, one way or another, throughout the world."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The threat has become increasingly serious as this expansionist aim has been reinforced by an advancing industrial, military and scientific establishment."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But what makes the Soviet threat unique in history is its all-inclusiveness.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Every human activity is pressed into service as a weapon of expansion.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Trade, economic development, military power, arts, science, education, the whole world of ideas--all are harnessed to this same chariot of expansion."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Soviets are, in short, waging total cold war."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The only answer to a regime that wages total cold war is to wage total peace.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This means bringing to bear every asset of our personal and national lives upon the task of building the conditions in which security and peace can grow.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,III.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Among our assets, let us first briefly glance at our military power."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Military power serves the cause of security by making prohibitive the cost of any aggressive attack.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It serves the cause of peace by holding up a shield behind which the patient constructive work of peace can go on.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But it can serve neither cause if we make either of two mistakes.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The one would be to overestimate our strength, and thus neglect crucially important actions in the period just ahead."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The other would be to underestimate our strength.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thereby we might be tempted to become irresolute in our foreign relations, to dishearten our friends, and to lose our national poise and perspective in approaching the complex problems ahead."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Any orderly balance-sheet of military strength must be in two parts.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The first is the position as of today.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The second is the position in the period ahead.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As of today: our defensive shield comprehends a vast complex of ground, sea, and air units, superbly equipped and strategically deployed around the world."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The most powerful deterrent to war in the world today lies in the retaliatory power of our Strategic Air Command and the aircraft of our Navy.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,They present to any potential attacker who would unleash war upon the world the prospect of virtual annihilation of his own country.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Even if we assume a surprise attack on our bases, with a marked reduction in our striking power, our bombers would immediately be on their way in sufficient strength to accomplish this mission of retaliation."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Every informed government knows this.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It is no secret.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Since the Korean Armistice, the American people have spent $225 billion in maintaining and strengthening this overall defensive shield."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This is the position as of today.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Now as to the period ahead: Every part of our military establishment must and will be equipped to do its defensive job with the most modern weapons and methods.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But it is particularly important to our planning that we make a candid estimate of the effect of long-range ballistic missiles on the present deterrent power I have described.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"At this moment, the consensus of opinion is that we are probably somewhat behind the Soviets in some areas of long-range ballistic missile development."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"But it is my conviction, based on close study of all relevant intelligence, that if we make the necessary effort, we will have the missiles, in the needed quantity and in time, to sustain and strengthen the deterrent power of our increasingly efficient bombers."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,One encouraging fact evidencing this ability is the rate of progress we have achieved since we began to concentrate on these missiles.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The intermediate ballistic missiles, Thor and Jupiter, have already been ordered into production."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The parallel progress in the intercontinental ballistic missile effort will be advanced by our plans for acceleration.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The development of the submarine-based Polaris missile system has progressed so well that its future procurement schedules are being moved forward markedly.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"When it is remembered that our country has concentrated on the development of ballistic missiles for only about a third as long as the Soviets, these achievements show a rate of progress that speaks for itself."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Only a brief time back, we were spending at the rate of only about one million dollars a year on long range ballistic missiles."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In 1957 we spent more than one billion dollars on the Atlas, Titan, Thor, Jupiter, and Polaris programs alone."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"But I repeat, gratifying though this rate of progress is, we must still do more!"
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our real problem, then, is not our strength today; it is rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,What I have just said applies to our strength as a single country.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But we are not alone.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"I have returned from the recent NATO meeting with renewed conviction that, because we are a part of a world-wide community of free and peaceful nations, our own security is immeasurably increased."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"By contrast, the Soviet Union has surrounded itself with captive and sullen nations."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Like a crack in the crust of an uneasily sleeping volcano, the Hungarian uprising revealed the depth and intensity of the patriotic longing for liberty that still burns within these countries."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The world thinks of us as a country which is strong, but which will never start a war."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The world also thinks of us as a land which has never enslaved anyone and which is animated by humane ideals.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This friendship, based on common ideals, is one of our greatest sources of strength."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"It cements into a cohesive security arrangement the aggregate of the spiritual, military and economic strength of all those nations which, with us, are allied by treaties and agreements."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Up to this point, I have talked solely about our military strength to deter a possible future war."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I now want to talk about the strength we need to win a different kind of war--one that has already been launched against us.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It is the massive economic offensive that has been mounted by the communist imperialists against free nations.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The communist imperialist regimes have for some time been largely frustrated in their attempts at expansion based directly on force.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a result, they have begun to concentrate heavily on economic penetration, particularly of newly-developing countries, as a preliminary to political domination."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This non-military drive, if underestimated, could defeat the free world regardless of our military strength."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This danger is all the greater precisely because many of us fail or refuse to recognize it.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thus, some people may be tempted to finance our extra military effort by cutting economic assistance."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"But at the very time when the economic threat is assuming menacing proportions, to fail to strengthen our own effort would be nothing less than reckless folly!"
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Admittedly, most of us did not anticipate the psychological impact upon the world of the launching of the first earth satellite."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Let us not make the same kind of mistake in another field, by failing to anticipate the much more serious impact of the Soviet economic offensive."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As with our military potential, our economic assets are more than equal to the task."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Our independent farmers produce an abundance of food and fibre.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our free workers are versatile, intelligent, and hardworking."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Our businessmen are imaginative and resourceful.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The productivity, the adaptability of the American economy is the solid foundation-stone of our security structure."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We have just concluded another prosperous year.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Our output was once more the greatest in the nation's history.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the latter part of the year, some decline in employment and output occurred, following the exceptionally rapid expansion of recent years."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In a free economy, reflecting as it does the independent judgments of millions of people, growth typically moves forward unevenly."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But the basic forces of growth remain unimpaired.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,There are solid grounds for confidence that economic growth will be resumed without an extended interruption.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, the Federal government, constantly alert to signs of weakening in any part of our economy, always stands ready, with its full power, to take any appropriate further action to promote renewed business expansion."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"If our history teaches us anything, it is this lesson: so far as the economic potential of our nation is concerned, the believers in the future of America have always been the realists."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I count myself as one of this company.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our long-range problem, then, is not the stamina of our enormous engine of production."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our problem is to make sure that we use these vast economic forces confidently and creatively, not only in direct military defense efforts, but likewise in our foreign policy, through such activities as mutual economic aid and foreign trade."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In much the same way, we have tremendous potential resources on other non-military fronts to help in countering the Soviet threat: education, science, research, and, not least, the ideas and principles by which we live."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,And in all these cases the task ahead is to bring these resources more sharply to bear upon the new tasks of security and peace in a swiftly-changing world.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,IV.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"There are many items in the Administration's program, of a kind frequently included in a State of the Union Message, with which I am not dealing today."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,They are important to us and to our prosperity.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But I am reserving them for treatment in separate communications because of my purpose today of speaking only about matters bearing directly upon our security and peace.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I now place before you an outline of action designed to focus our resources upon the two tasks of security and peace.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,In this special category I list eight items requiring action.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,They are not merely desirable.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,They are imperative. 1.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,DEFENSE REORGANIZATION The first need is to assure ourselves that military organization facilitates rather than hinders the functioning of the military establishment in maintaining the security of the nation.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Since World War II, the purpose of achieving maximum organizational efficiency in a modern defense establishment has several times occasioned action by the Congress and by the Executive."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The advent of revolutionary new devices, bringing with them the problem of overall continental defense, creates new difficulties, reminiscent of those attending the advent of the airplane half a century ago."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Some of the important new weapons which technology has produced do not fit into any existing service pattern.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"They cut across all services, involve all services, and transcend all services, at every stage from development to operation."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,In some instances they defy classification according to branch of service.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Unfortunately, the uncertainties resulting from such a situation, and the jurisdictional disputes attending upon it, tend to bewilder and confuse the public and create the impression that service differences are damaging the national interest."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Let us proudly remember that the members of the Armed Forces give their basic allegiance solely to the United States.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Of that fact all of us are certain.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But pride of service and mistaken zeal in promoting particular doctrine has more than once occasioned the kind of difficulty of which I have just spoken.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I am not attempting today to pass judgment on the charge of harmful service rivalries.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But one thing is sure.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Whatever they are, America wants them stopped."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Recently I have had under special study the never-ending problem of efficient organization, complicated as it is by new weapons."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Soon my conclusions will be finalized.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall promptly take such Executive action as is necessary and, in a separate message, I shall present appropriate recommendations to the Congress."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Meanwhile, without anticipating the detailed form that a reorganization should take, I can state its main lines in terms of objectives: A major purpose of military organization is to achieve real unity in the Defense establishment in all the principal features of military activities."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Of all these, one of the most important to our nation's security is strategic planning and control."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This work must be done under unified direction.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The defense structure must be one which, as a whole, can assume, with top efficiency and without friction, the defense of America."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Defense establishment must therefore plan for a better integration of its defensive resources, particularly with respect to the newer weapons now building and under development."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"These obviously require full coordination in their development, production and use."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Good organization can help assure this coordination.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In recognition of the need for single control in some of our most advanced development projects, the Secretary of Defense has already decided to concentrate into one organization all the anti-missile and satellite technology undertaken within the Department of Defense."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Another requirement of military organization is a clear subordination of the military services to duly constituted civilian authority.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This control must be real; not merely on the surface.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Next there must be assurance that an excessive number of compartments in organization will not create costly and confusing compartments in our scientific and industrial effort.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Finally, to end inter-service disputes requires clear organization and decisive central direction, supported by the unstinted cooperation of every individual in the defense establishment, civilian and military. 2."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,ACCELERATED DEFENSE EFFORT The second major action item is the acceleration of the defense effort in particular areas affected by the fast pace of scientific and technological advance.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Some of the points at which improved and increased effort are most essential are these: We must have sure warning in case of attack.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The improvement of warning equipment is becoming increasingly important as we approach the period when long-range missiles will come into use.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We must protect and disperse our striking forces and increase their readiness for instant reaction.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This means more base facilities and standby crews.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We must maintain deterrent retaliatory power.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This means, among other things, stepped-up long range missile programs; accelerated programs for other effective missile systems; and, for some years, more advanced aircraft."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We must maintain freedom of the seas.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,This means nuclear submarines and cruisers; improved anti-submarine weapons; missile ships; and the like.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must maintain all necessary types of mobile forces to deal with local conflicts, should there be need."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This means further improvements in equipment, mobility, tactics and fire power."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through increases in pay and incentive, we must maintain in the armed forces the skilled manpower modern military forces require."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We must be forward-looking in our research and development to anticipate and achieve the unimagined weapons of the future.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"With these and other improvements, we intend to assure that our vigilance, power, and technical excellence keep abreast of any realistic threat we face. 3."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,MUTUAL AID Third: We must continue to strengthen our mutual security efforts.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Most people now realize that our programs of military aid and defense support are an integral part of our own defense effort.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"If the foundation of the Free World structure were progressively allowed to crumble under the pressure of communist imperialism, the entire house of freedom would be in danger of collapse."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As for the mutual economic assistance program, the benefit to us is threefold."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, the countries receiving this aid become bulwarks against communist encroachment as their military defenses and economies are strengthened."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Nations that are conscious of a steady improvement in their industry, education, health and standard of living are not apt to fall prey to the blandishments of communist imperialists."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, these countries are helped to reach the point where mutually profitable trade can expand between them and us."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, the mutual confidence that comes from working together on constructive projects creates an atmosphere in which real understanding and peace can flourish."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"To help bring these multiple benefits, our economic aid effort should be made more effective."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In proposals for future economic aid, I am stressing a greater use of repayable loans, through the Development Loan Fund, through funds generated by sale of surplus farm products, and through the Export-Import Bank."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"While some increase in Government funds will be required, it remains our objective to encourage shifting to the use of private capital sources as rapidly as possible."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"One great obstacle to the economic aid program in the past has been, not a rational argument against it on the merits, but a catchword: ""give-away program."" The real fact is that no investment we make in our own security and peace can pay us greater dividends than necessary amounts of economic aid to friendly nations."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This is no ""give-away."" Let's stick to facts!"
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We cannot afford to have one of our most essential security programs shot down with a slogan! 4.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"MUTUAL TRADE Fourth: Both in our national interest, and in the interest of world peace, we must have a five-year extension of the Trade Agreements Act with broadened authority to negotiate."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,World trade supports a significant segment of American industry and agriculture.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It provides employment for four and one-half million American workers.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It helps supply our ever increasing demand for raw materials.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It provides the opportunity for American free enterprise to develop on a worldwide scale.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It strengthens our friends and increases their desire to be friends.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,World trade helps to lay the groundwork for peace by making all free nations of the world stronger and more self-reliant.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,America is today the world's greatest trading nation.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we use this great asset wisely to meet the expanding demands of the world, we shall not only provide future opportunities for our own business, agriculture, and labor, but in the process strengthen our security posture and other prospects for a prosperous, harmonious world."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As President McKinley said, as long ago as 1901: ""Isolation is no longer possible or desirable. . . ."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The period of exclusiveness is past."" 5."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,SCIENTIFIC COOPERATION WITH OUR ALLIES Fifth: It is of the highest importance that the Congress enact the necessary legislation to enable us to exchange appropriate scientific and technical information with friendly countries as part of our effort to achieve effective scientific cooperation.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It is wasteful in the extreme for friendly allies to consume talent and money in solving problems that their friends have already solved-- all because of artificial barriers to sharing.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We cannot afford to cut ourselves off from the brilliant talents and minds of scientists in friendly countries.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The task ahead will be hard enough without handcuffs of our own making.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,The groundwork for this kind of cooperation has already been laid in discussions among NATO countries.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Promptness in following through with legislation will be the best possible evidence of American unity of purpose in cooperating with our friends. 6.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"EDUCATION AND RESEARCH Sixth: In the area of education and research, I recommend a balanced program to improve our resources, involving an investment of about a billion dollars over a four year period."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This involves new activities by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare designed principally to encourage improved teaching quality and student opportunities in the interests of national security."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It also provides a five-fold increase in sums available to the National Science Foundation for its special activities in stimulating and improving science education.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Scrupulous attention has been paid to maintaining local control of educational policy, spurring the maximum amount of local effort, and to avoiding undue stress on the physical sciences at the expense of other branches of learning."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the field of research, I am asking for substantial increases in basic research funds, including a doubling of the funds available to the National Science Foundation for this purpose."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But federal action can do only a part of the job.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In both education and research, redoubled exertions will be necessary on the part of all Americans if we are to rise to the demands of our times."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This means hard work on the part of state and local governments, private industry, schools and colleges, private organizations and foundations, teachers, parents, and--perhaps most important of all--the student himself, with his bag of books and his homework."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"With this kind of all-inclusive campaign, I have no doubt that we can create the intellectual capital we need for the years ahead, invest it in the right places--and do all this, not as regimented pawns, but as free men and women! 7."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"SPENDING AND SAVING Seventh: To provide for this extra effort for security, we must apply stern tests of priority to other expenditures, both military and civilian."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This extra effort involves, most immediately, the need for a supplemental defense appropriation of $1.3 billion for fiscal year 1958."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the 1959 budget, increased expenditures for missiles, nuclear ships, atomic energy, research and development, science and education, a special contingency fund to deal with possible new technological discoveries, and increases in pay and incentives to obtain and retain competent manpower add up to a total increase over the comparable figures in the 1957 budget of about $4 billion."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"I believe that, in spite of these necessary increases, we should strive to finance the 1959 security effort out of expected revenues."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"While we now believe that expected revenues and expenditures will roughly balance, our real purpose will be to achieve adequate security, but always with the utmost regard for efficiency and careful management."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This purpose will require the cooperation of Congress in making careful analysis of estimates presented, reducing expenditure on less essential military programs and installations, postponing some new civilian programs, transferring some to the states, and curtailing or eliminating others."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Such related matters as the national debt ceiling and tax revenues will be dealt with in later messages. 8.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,WORKS OF PEACE My last call for action is not primarily addressed to the Congress and people of the United States.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Rather, it is a message from the people of the United States to all other peoples, especially those of the Soviet Union."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"This is the spirit of what we would like to say: ""In the last analysis, there is only one solution to the grim problems that lie ahead."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The world must stop the present plunge toward more and more destructive weapons of war, and turn the corner that will start our steps firmly on the path toward lasting peace. ""Our greatest hope for success lies in a universal fact: the people of the world, as people, have always wanted peace and want peace now. ""The problem, then, is to find a way of translating this universal desire into action. ""This will require more than words of peace."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"It requires works of peace."" Now, may I try to give you some concrete examples of the kind of works of peace that might make a beginning in the new direction."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,For a start our people should learn to know each other better.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Recent negotiations in Washington have provided a basis in principle for greater freedom of communication and exchange of people.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge the Soviet government to cooperate in turning principle into practice by prompt and tangible actions that will break down the unnatural barriers that have blocked the flow of thought and understanding between our people.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Another kind of work of peace is cooperation on projects of human welfare.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"For example, we now have it within our power to eradicate from the face of the earth that age-old scourge of mankind: malaria."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We are embarking with other nations in an all-out five-year campaign to blot out this curse forever.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We invite the Soviets to join with us in this great work of humanity.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Indeed, we would be willing to pool our efforts with the Soviets in other campaigns against the diseases that are the common enemy of all mortals--such as cancer and heart disease."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"If people can get together on such projects, is it not possible that we could then go on to a full-scale cooperative program of Science for Peace?"
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have as a guide and inspiration the success of our Atoms-for-Peace proposal, which in only a few years, under United Nations auspices, became a reality in the International Atomic Energy Agency."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,A program of Science for Peace might provide a means of funneling into one place the results of research from scientists everywhere and from there making it available to all parts of the world.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,There is almost no limit to the human betterment that could result from such cooperation.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Hunger and disease could increasingly be driven from the earth.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The age-old dream of a good life for all could, at long last, be translated into reality."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"But of all the works of peace, none is more needed now than a real first step toward disarmament."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Last August the United Nations General Assembly, by an overwhelming vote, approved a disarmament plan that we and our allies sincerely believed to be fair and practical."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Soviets have rejected both the plan, and the negotiating procedure set up by the United Nations."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a result, negotiation on this supremely important issue is now at a standstill."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,But the world cannot afford to stand still on disarmament!
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We must never give up the search for a basis of agreement.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Our allies from time to time develop differing ideas on how to proceed.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,We must concert these convictions among ourselves.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Thereafter, any reasonable proposal that holds promise for disarmament and reduction of tension must be heard, discussed, and, if possible, negotiated."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"But a disarmament proposal, to hold real promise, must at the minimum have one feature: reliable means to ensure compliance by all."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,It takes actions and demonstrated integrity on both sides to create and sustain confidence.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"And confidence in a genuine disarmament agreement is vital, not only to the signers of the agreement, but also to the millions of people all over the world who are weary of tensions and armaments."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"I say once more, to all peoples, that we will always go the extra mile with anyone on earth if it will bring us nearer a genuine peace."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"CONCLUSION These, then, are the ways in which we must funnel our energies more efficiently into the task of advancing security and peace."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"These actions demand and expect two things of the American people: sacrifice, and a high degree of understanding."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,For sacrifice to be effective it must be intelligent.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,Sacrifice must be made for the right purpose and in the right place--even if that place happens to come close to home!
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"After all, it is no good demanding sacrifice in general terms one day, and the next day, for local reasons, opposing the elimination of some unneeded federal facility."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is pointless to condemn federal spending in general, and the next moment condemn just as strongly an effort to reduce the particular federal grant that touches one's own interest."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"And it makes no sense whatever to spend additional billions on military strength to deter a potential danger, and then, by cutting aid and trade programs, let the world succumb to a present danger in economic guise."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,My friends of the Congress: The world is waiting to see how wisely and decisively a free representative government will now act.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I believe that this Congress possesses and will display the wisdom promptly to do its part in translating into law the actions demanded by our nation's interests.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"But, to make law effective, our kind of government needs the full voluntary support of millions of Americans for these actions."
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,I am fully confident that the response of the Congress and of the American people will make this time of test a time of honor.
1958,Eisenhower,Republican,"Mankind then will see more clearly than ever that the future belongs, not to the concept of the regimented atheistic state, but to the people--the God-fearing, peace-loving people of all the world."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION This is the moment when Congress and the Executive annually begin their cooperative work to build a better America.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"One basic purpose unites us: To promote strength and security, side by side with liberty and opportunity."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"As we meet today, in the 170th year of the Republic, our Nation must continue to provide--as all other free governments have had to do throughout time--a satisfactory answer to a question as old as history."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is: Can Government based upon liberty and the God-given rights of man, permanently endure when ceaselessly challenged by a dictatorship, hostile to our mode of life, and controlling an economic and military power of great and growing strength?"
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"For us the answer has always been found, and is still found in the devotion, the vision, the courage and the fortitude of our people."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, this challenge we face, not as a single powerful nation, but as one that has in recent decades reached a position of recognized leadership in the Free World."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We have arrived at this position of leadership in an era of remarkable productivity and growth.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,It is also a time when man's power of mass destruction has reached fearful proportions.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Possession of such capabilities helps create world suspicion and tension.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We, on our part, know that we seek only a just peace for all, with aggressive designs against no one."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Yet we realize that there is uneasiness in the world because of a belief on the part of peoples that through arrogance, miscalculation or fear of attack, catastrophic war could be launched."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Keeping the peace in today's world more than ever calls for the utmost in the nation's resolution, wisdom, steadiness and unremitting effort."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We cannot build peace through desire alone.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, we have learned the bitter lesson that international agreements, historically considered by us as sacred, are regarded in Communist doctrine and in practice to be mere scraps of paper."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The most recent proof of their disdain of international obligations, solemnly undertaken, is their announced intention to abandon their responsibilities respecting Berlin."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a consequence, we can have no confidence in any treaty to which Communists are a party except where such a treaty provides within itself for self-enforcing mechanisms."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Indeed, the demonstrated disregard of the Communists of their own pledges is one of the greatest obstacles to success in substituting the Rule of Law for rule by force."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet step by step we must strengthen the institutions of peace--a peace that rests upon justice--a peace that depends upon a deep knowledge and clear understanding by all peoples of the cause and consequences of possible failure in this great purpose.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,To achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any dimension.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"If, despite our best efforts, a local dispute should flare into armed hostilities, the next problem would be to keep the conflict from spreading, and so compromising freedom."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,In support of these objectives we maintain forces of great power and flexibility.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Our formidable air striking forces are a powerful deterrent to general war.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Large and growing portions of these units can depart from their bases in a matter of minutes.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Similar forces are included in our naval fleets.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Ground and other tactical formations can move with swiftness and precision, when requested by friendly and responsible governments, to help curb threatened aggression."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The stabilizing influence of this capacity has been dramatically demonstrated more than once over the past year.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Our military and related scientific progress has been highly gratifying.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Great strides have been made in the development of ballistic missiles.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Intermediate range missiles are now being deployed in operational units.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile program has been marked by rapid development as evidenced by recent successful tests.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Missile training units have been established and launching sites are far along in construction.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,New aircraft that fly at twice the speed of sound are entering our squadrons.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We have successfully placed five satellites in orbit, which have gathered information of scientific importance never before available."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Our latest satellite illustrates our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadows new developments in world-wide communications.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Warning systems constantly improve.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Our atomic submarines have shattered endurance records and made historic voyages under the North Polar Sea.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,A major segment of our national scientific and engineering community is working intensively to achieve new and greater developments.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Advance in military technology requires adequate financing but, of course, even more, it requires talent and time."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,All this is given only as a matter of history; as a record of our progress in space and ballistic missile fields in no more than four years of intensive effort.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,At the same time we clearly recognize that some of the recent Soviet accomplishments in this particular technology are indeed brilliant.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Under the law enacted last year the Department of Defense is being reorganized to give the Secretary of Defense full authority over the military establishment.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Greater efficiency, more cohesive effort and speedier reaction to emergencies are among the many advantages we are already noting from these changes."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,These few highlights point up our steady military gains.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We are rightfully gratified by the achievements they represent.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But we must remember that these imposing armaments are purchased at great cost.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,National Security programs account for nearly sixty percent of the entire Federal budget for this coming fiscal year.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Modern weapons are exceedingly expensive.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The overall cost of introducing ATLAS into our armed forces will average $35 million per missile on the firing line.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,This year we are investing an aggregate of close to $7 billion in missile programs alone.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Other billions go for research, development, test and evaluation of new weapons systems."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our latest atomic submarines will cost $50 millions each, while some special types will cost three times as much."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We are now ordering fighter aircraft which are priced at fifty times as much as the fighters of World War II.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We are buying certain bombers that cost their weight in gold.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"These sums are tremendous, even when compared with the marvelous resiliency and capacity of our economy."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Such expenditures demand both balance and perspective in our planning for defense.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"At every turn, we must weigh, judge and select."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Needless duplication of weapons and forces must be avoided.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must guard against feverish building of vast armaments to meet glibly predicted moments of so-called ""maximum peril."" The threat we face is not sporadic or dated: It is continuous."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Hence we must not be swayed in our calculations either by groundless fear or by complacency.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must avoid extremes, for vacillation between extremes is inefficient, costly, and destructive of morale."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In these days of unceasing technological advance, we must plan our defense expenditures systematically and with care, fully recognizing that obsolescence compels the never-ending replacement of older weapons with new ones."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The defense budget for the coming year has been planned on the basis of these principles and considerations.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Over these many months I have personally participated in its development.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The aim is a sensible posture of defense.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The secondary aim is increased efficiency and avoidance of waste.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Both are achieved by this budgetary plan.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Working by these guide lines I believe with all my heart that America can be as sure of the strength and efficiency of her armed forces as she is of their loyalty.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am equally sure that the nation will thus avoid useless expenditures which, in the name of security, might tend to undermine the economy and, therefore, the nation's safety."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Our own vast strength is only a part of that required for dependable security.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Because of this we have joined with nearly 50 other nations in collective security arrangements.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,In these common undertakings each nation is expected to contribute what it can in sharing the heavy load.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Each supplies part of a strategic deployment to protect the forward boundaries of freedom.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Constantly we seek new ways to make more effective our contribution to this system of collective security.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Recently I have asked a Committee of eminent Americans of both parties to re-appraise our military assistance programs and the relative emphasis which should be placed on military and economic aid.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I am hopeful that preliminary recommendations of this Committee will be available in time to assist in shaping the Mutual Security program for the coming fiscal year.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Any survey of the free world's defense structure cannot fail to impart a feeling of regret that so much of our effort and resources must be devoted to armaments.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"At Geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and other agreements that may help to open up, with some promise, the issues of international disarmament."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"America will never give up the hope that eventually all nations can, with mutual confidence, drastically reduce these non-productive expenditures."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,II.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The material foundation of our national safety is a strong and expanding economy.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,This we have--and this we must maintain.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Only with such an economy can we be secure and simultaneously provide for the well-being of our people.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,A year ago the nation was experiencing a decline in employment and output.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Today that recession is fading into history, and this without gigantic, hastily-improvised public works projects or untimely tax reductions."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,A healthy and vigorous recovery has been under way since last May.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,New homes are being built at the highest rate in several years.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Retail sales are at peak levels.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Personal income is at an all-time high.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The marked forward thrust of our economy reaffirms our confidence in competitive enterprise.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But--clearly--wisdom and prudence in both the public and private sectors of the economy are always necessary.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our outlook is this: 1960 commitments for our armed forces, the Atomic Energy Commission and Military Assistance exceed 47 billion dollars."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,In the foreseeable future they are not likely to be significantly lower.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"With an annual population increase of three million, other governmental costs are bound to mount."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"After we have provided wisely for our military strength, we must judge how to allocate our remaining government resources most effectively to promote our well-being and economic growth."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Federal programs that will benefit all citizens are moving forward.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Next year we will be spending increased amounts on health programs; on Federal assistance to science and education; on the development of the nation's water resources; on the renewal of urban areas; and on our vast system of Federal-aid highways.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Each of these additional outlays is being made necessary by the surging growth of America.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Let me illustrate.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Responsive to this growth, Federal grants and long term loans to assist 14 major types of capital improvements in our cities will total over 2 billion dollars in 1960--double the expenditure of two years ago."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The major responsibility for development in these fields rests in the localities, even though the Federal Government will continue to do its proper part in meeting the genuine needs of a burgeoning population."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But the progress of our economy can more than match the growth of our needs.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We need only to act wisely and confidently.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here, I hope you will permit me to digress long enough to express something that is much on my mind."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The basic question facing us today is more than mere survival--the military defense of national life and territory.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,It is the preservation of a way of life.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We must meet the world challenge and at the same time permit no stagnation in America.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Unless we progress, we regress."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We can successfully sustain security and remain true to our heritage of freedom if we clearly visualize the tasks ahead and set out to perform them with resolution and fervor.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We must first define these tasks and then understand what we must do to perform them.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"If progress is to be steady we must have long term guides extending far ahead, certainly five, possibly even ten years."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,They must reflect the knowledge that before the end of five years we will have a population of over 190 million.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"They must be goals that stand high, and so inspire every citizen to climb always toward mounting levels of moral, intellectual and material strength."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Every advance toward them must stir pride in individual and national achievements.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"To define these goals, I intend to mobilize help from every available source."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We need more than politically ordained national objectives to challenge the best efforts of free men and women.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"A group of selfless and devoted individuals, outside of government, could effectively participate in making the necessary appraisal of the potentials of our future."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The result would be establishment of national goals that would not only spur us on to our finest efforts, but would meet the stern test of practicality."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Committee I plan will comprise educators and representatives of labor, management, finance, the professions and every other kind of useful activity."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such a study would update and supplement, in the light of continuous changes in our society and its economy, the monumental work of the Committee on Recent Social Trends which was appointed in 1931 by President Hoover."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Its report has stood the test of time and has had a beneficial influence on national development.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The new Committee would be concerned, among other things, with the acceleration of our economy's growth and the living standards of our people, their health and education, their better assurance of life and liberty and their greater opportunities."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"It would also be concerned with methods to meet such goals and what levels of government--Local, State, or Federal--might or should be particularly concerned."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"As one example, consider our schools, operated under the authority of local communities and states."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,In their capacity and in their quality they conform to no recognizable standards.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In some places facilities are ample, in others meager."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Pay of teachers ranges between wide limits, from the adequate to the shameful."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"As would be expected, quality of teaching varies just as widely."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But to our teachers we commit the most valuable possession of the nation and of the family-- our children.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We must have teachers of competence.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,To obtain and hold them we need standards.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We need a National Goal.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Once established I am certain that public opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such studies would be helpful, I believe, to government at all levels and to all individuals."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The goals so established could help us see our current needs in perspective.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,They will spur progress.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We do not forget, of course, that our nation's progress and fiscal integrity are interdependent and inseparable."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We can afford everything we clearly need, but we cannot afford one cent of waste."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We must examine every item of governmental expense critically.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,To do otherwise would betray our nation's future.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Thrift is one of the characteristics that has made this nation great.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Why should we ignore it now?
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must avoid any contribution to inflationary processes, which could disrupt sound growth in our economy."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Prices have displayed a welcome stability in recent months and, if we are wise and resolute, we will not tolerate inflation in the years to come."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But history makes clear the risks inherent in any failure to deal firmly with the basic causes of inflation.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Two of the most important of these causes are the wage-price spiral and continued deficit financing.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Inflation would reduce job opportunities, price us out of world markets, shrink the value of savings and penalize the thrift so essential to finance a growing economy."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Inflation is not a Robin Hood, taking from the rich to give to the poor."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Rather, it deals most cruelly with those who can least protect themselves."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,It strikes hardest those millions of our citizens whose incomes do not quickly rise with the cost of living.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"When prices soar, the pensioner and the widow see their security undermined, the man of thrift sees his savings melt away; the white collar worker, the minister, and the teacher see their standards of living dragged down."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Inflation can be prevented.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But this demands statesmanship on the part of business and labor leaders and of government at all levels.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must encourage the self-discipline, the restraint necessary to curb the wage-price spiral and we must meet current costs from current revenue."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"To minimize the danger of future soaring prices and to keep our economy sound and expanding, I shall present to the Congress certain proposals."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, I shall submit a balanced budget for the next year, a year expected to be the most prosperous in our history."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,It is a realistic budget with wholly attainable objectives.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we cannot live within our means during such a time of rising prosperity, the hope for fiscal integrity will fade."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we persist in living beyond our means, we make it difficult for every family in our land to balance its own household budget."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But to live within our means would be a tangible demonstration of the self-discipline needed to assure a stable dollar.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Constitution entrusts the Executive with many functions, but the Congress--and the Congress alone--has the power of the purse."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Ultimately upon Congress rests responsibility for determining the scope and amount of Federal spending.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"By working together, the Congress and the Executive can keep a balance between income and outgo."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,If this is done there is real hope that we can look forward to a time in the foreseeable future when needed tax reforms can be accomplished.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this hope, I am requesting the Secretary of the Treasury to prepare appropriate proposals for revising, at the proper time, our tax structure, to remove inequities and to enhance incentives for all Americans to work, to save, and to invest."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Such recommendations will be made as soon as our fiscal condition permits.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,These prospects will be brightened if 1960 expenditures do not exceed the levels recommended.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, I shall recommend to the Congress that the Chief Executive be given the responsibility either to approve or to veto specific items in appropriations and authorization bills. [I assure you gentlemen that I know this recommendation has been made time and again by every President that has appeared in this hall for many years, but I say this, it still is one of the most important corrections that could be made in our annual expenditure program, because this would save tax dollars.] Third, to reduce Federal operations in an area where private enterprise can do the job, I shall recommend legislation for greater flexibility in extending Federal credit, and in improving the procedures under which private credits are insured or guaranteed."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Present practices have needlessly added large sums to Federal expenditures.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fourth, action is required to make more effective use of the large Federal expenditures for agriculture and to achieve greater fiscal control in this area."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Outlays of the Department of Agriculture for the current fiscal year for the support of farm prices on a very few farm products will exceed five billion dollars.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,That is a sum equal to approximately two-fifths of the net income of all farm operators in the entire United States.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,By the end of this fiscal year it is estimated that there will be in Government hands surplus farm products worth about nine billion dollars.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"And by July 1, 1959, Government expenditures for storage, interest, and handling of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion dollars a year."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,This level of expenditure for farm products could be made willingly for a temporary period if it were leading to a sound solution of the problem.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But unfortunately this is not true.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We need new legislation.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,In the past I have sent messages to the Congress requesting greater freedom for our farmers to manage their own farms and greater freedom for markets to reflect the wishes of producers and consumers.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislative changes that followed were appropriate in direction but did not go far enough.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The situation calls for prompt and forthright action.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Recommendation for action will be contained in a message to be transmitted to the Congress shortly.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,These fiscal and related actions will help create an environment of price stability for economic growth.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"However, certain additional measures are needed."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall ask Congress to amend the Employment Act of 1946 to make it clear that Government intends to use all appropriate means to protect the buying power of the dollar.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am establishing a continuing Cabinet group on Price Stability for Economic Growth to study governmental and private policies affecting costs, prices, and economic growth."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,It will strive also to build a better public understanding of the conditions necessary for maintaining growth and price stability.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Studies are being undertaken to improve our information on prices, wages, and productivity."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I believe all citizens in all walks of life will support this program of action to accelerate economic growth and promote price stability.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,III.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I take up next certain aspects of our international situation and our programs to strengthen it.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"America's security can be assured only within a world community of strong, stable, independent nations, in which the concepts of freedom, justice and human dignity can flourish."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,There can be no such thing as Fortress America.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"If ever we were reduced to the isolation implied by that term, we would occupy a prison, not a fortress."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The question whether we can afford to help other nations that want to defend their freedom but cannot fully do so from their own means, has only one answer: we can and we must, we we have been doing so since 1947."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Our foreign policy has long been dedicated to building a permanent and just peace.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,During the past six years our free world security arrangements have been bolstered and the bonds of freedom have been more closely knit.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our friends in Western Europe are experiencing new internal vitality, and are increasingly more able to resist external threats."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Over the years the world has come to understand clearly that it is our firm policy not to countenance aggression.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In Lebanon, Taiwan, and Berlin--our stand has been clear, right, and expressive of the determined will of a united people."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Acting with other free nations we have undertaken the solemn obligation to defend the people of free Berlin against any effort to destroy their freedom.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the meantime we shall constantly seek meaningful agreements to settle this and other problems, knowing full well that not only the integrity of a single city, but the hope of all free peoples is at stake."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We need, likewise, to continue helping to build the economic base so essential to the Free World's stability and strength."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have both fully proven their worth as instruments of international financial cooperation.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Their Executive Directors have recommended an increase in each member country's subscription.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I am requesting the Congress for immediate approval of our share of these increases.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We are now negotiating with representatives of the twenty Latin American Republics for the creation of an inter-American financial institution.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Its purpose would be to join all the American Republics in a common institution which would promote and finance development in Latin America, and make more effective the use of capital from the World Bank, the Export-Import Bank, and private sources."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Private enterprise continues to make major contributions to economic development in all parts of the world.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"But we have not yet marshalled the full potential of American business for this task, particularly in countries which have recently attained their independence."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall present to this Congress a program designed to encourage greater participation by private enterprise in economic development abroad.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Further, all of us know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do much more than help build sound economies."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The spiritual, intellectual, and physical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis determine their willingness and their ability to resist Communism."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,To give a single illustration of our many efforts in these fields: We have been a participant in the effort that has been made over the past few years against one of the great scourges of mankind--disease.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Through the Mutual Security program public health officials are being trained by American universities to serve in less developed countries.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We are engaged in intensive malaria eradication projects in many parts of the world.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,America's major successes in our own country prove the feasibility of success everywhere.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,By these and other means we shall continue and expand our campaign against the afflictions that now bring needless suffering and death to so many of the world's people.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We wish to be part of a great shared effort toward the triumph of health.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,IV.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"America is best described by one word, freedom."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,If we hope to strengthen freedom in the world we must be ever mindful of how our own conduct reacts elsewhere.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,No nation has ever been so floodlighted by world opinion as the United States is today.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Everything we do is carefully scrutinized by other peoples throughout the world.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The bad is seen along with the good.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Because we are human we err.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,But as free men we are also responsible for correcting the errors and imperfections of our ways.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Last January I made comprehensive recommendations to the Congress for legislation in the labor-management field.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"To my disappointment, Congress failed to act."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The McClellan Committee disclosures of corruption, racketeering, and abuse of trust and power in labor-management affairs have aroused America and amazed other peoples."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,They emphasize the need for improved local law enforcement and the enactment of effective Federal legislation to protect the public interest and to insure the rights and economic freedoms of millions of American workers.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Halfhearted measures will not do.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall recommend prompt enactment of legislation designed: To safeguard workers' funds in union treasuries against misuse of any kind whatsoever.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"To protect the rights and freedoms of individual union members, including the basic right to free and secret elections of officers."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,To advance true and responsible collective bargaining.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,To protect the public and innocent third parties from unfair and coercive practices such as boycotting and blackmail picketing.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The workers and the public must have these vital protections.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In other areas of human rights--freedom from discrimination in voting, in public education, in access to jobs, and in other respects-- the world is likewise watching our conduct."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The image of America abroad is not improved when school children, through closing of some of our schools and through no fault of their own, are deprived of their opportunity for an education."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,The government of a free people has no purpose more noble than to work for the maximum realization of equality of opportunity under law.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,This is not the sole responsibility of any one branch of our government.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"The judicial arm, which has the ultimate authority for interpreting the Constitution, has held that certain state laws and practices discriminate upon racial grounds and are unconstitutional."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Whenever the supremacy of the Constitution of the United States is challenged I shall continue to take every action necessary to uphold it.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"One of the fundamental concepts of our constitutional system is that it guarantees to every individual, regardless of race, religion, or national origin, the equal protection of the laws."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Those of us who are privileged to hold public office have a solemn obligation to make meaningful this inspiring objective.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We can fulfill that obligation by our leadership in teaching, persuading, demonstrating, and in enforcing the law."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We are making noticeable progress in the field of civil rights-- we are moving forward toward achievement of equality of opportunity for all people everywhere in the United States.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the interest of the nation and of each of its citizens, that progress must continue."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Legislative proposals of the Administration in this field will be submitted to the Congress early in the session.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,All of us should help to make clear that the government is united in the common purpose of giving support to the law and the decisions of the Courts.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"By moving steadily toward the goal of greater freedom under law, for our own people, we shall be the better prepared to work for the cause of freedom under law throughout the world."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"All peoples are sorely tired of the fear, destruction, and the waste of war."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"As never before, the world knows the human and material costs of war and seeks to replace force with a genuine rule of law among nations."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is my purpose to intensify efforts during the coming two years in seeking ways to supplement the procedures of the United Nations and other bodies with similar objectives, to the end that the rule of law may replace the rule of force in the affairs of nations."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Measures toward this end will be proposed later, including a re-examination of our own relation to the International Court of Justice."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,Finally--let us remind ourselves that Marxist scripture is not new; it is not the gospel of the future.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"Its basic objective is dictatorship, old as history."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,What is new is the shining prospect that man can build a world where all can live in dignity.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"We seek victory--not over any nation or people--but over the ancient enemies of us all; victory over ignorance, poverty, disease, and human degradation wherever they may be found."
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,We march in the noblest of causes--human freedom.
1959,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we make ourselves worthy of America's ideals, if we do not forget that our nation was founded on the premise that all men are creatures of God's making, the world will come to know that it is free men who carry forward the true promise of human progress and dignity."

1960,Eisenhower,Republican,PRESIDENT DWIGHT D.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,EISENHOWER'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION Seven years ago I entered my present office with one long-held resolve overriding all others.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"I was then, and remain now, determined that the United States shall become an ever more potent resource for the cause of peace--realizing that peace cannot be for ourselves alone, but for peoples everywhere."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"This determination is shared by the entire Congress--indeed, by all Americans."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"My purpose today is to discuss some features of America's position, both at home and in her relations to others."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, I point out that for us, annual self-examination is made a definite necessity by the fact that we now live in a divided world of uneasy equilibrium, with our side committed to its own protection and against aggression by the other."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"With both sides of this divided world in possession of unbelievably destructive weapons, mankind approaches a state where mutual annihilation becomes a possibility."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"No other fact of today's world equals this in importance--it colors everything we say, plan, and do."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"There is demanded of us, vigilance, determination, and the dedication of whatever portion of our resources that will provide adequate security, especially a real deterrent to aggression."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,These things we are doing.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,All these facts emphasize the importance of striving incessantly for a just peace.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Only through the strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, economic and defensive resources of the Free World can we, in confidence, make progress toward this goal."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, we note that recent Soviet deportment and pronouncements suggest the possible opening of a somewhat less strained period in the relationships between the Soviet Union and the Free World."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"If these pronouncements be genuine, there is brighter hope of diminishing the intensity of past rivalry and eventually of substituting persuasion for coercion."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Whether this is to become an era of lasting promise remains to be tested by actions.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, we now stand in the vestibule of a vast new technological age--one that, despite its capacity for human destruction, has an equal capacity to make poverty and human misery obsolete."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,If our efforts are wisely directed--and if our unremitting efforts for dependable peace begin to attain some success--we can surely become participants in creating an age characterized by justice and rising levels of human well-being.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Over the past year the Soviet Union has expressed an interest in measures to reduce the common peril of war.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"While neither we nor any other Free World nation can permit ourselves to be misled by pleasant promises until they are tested by performance, yet we approach this apparently new opportunity with the utmost seriousness."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must strive to break the calamitous cycle of frustrations and crises which, if unchecked, could spiral into nuclear disaster; the ultimate insanity."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Though the need for dependable agreements to assure against resort to force in settling disputes is apparent to both sides yet as in other issues dividing men and nations, we cannot expect sudden and revolutionary results."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,But we must find some place to begin.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,One obvious road on which to make a useful start is in the widening of communication between our two peoples.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In this field there are, both sides willing, countless opportunities--most of them well known to us all--for developing mutual understanding, the true foundation of peace."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Another avenue may be through the reopening, on January twelfth, of negotiations looking to a controlled ban on the testing of nuclear weapons."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Unfortunately, the closing statement from the Soviet scientists who met with our scientists at Geneva in an unsuccessful effort to develop an agreed basis for a test ban, gives the clear impression that their conclusions have been politically guided."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Those of the British and American scientific representatives are their own freely-formed, individual and collective opinions."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"I am hopeful that as new negotiations begin, truth--not political opportunism--will be the guiding light of the deliberations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Still another avenue may be found in the field of disarmament, in which the Soviets have professed a readiness to negotiate seriously."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"They have not, however, made clear the plans they may have, if any, for mutual inspection and verification--the essential condition for any extensive measure of disarmament."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,There is one instance where our initiative for peace has recently been successful.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"A multi-lateral treaty signed last month provides for the exclusively peaceful use of Antarctica, assured by a system of inspection."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"It provides for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent, and prohibits nuclear explosions there pending general international agreement on the subject."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The Treaty is a significant contribution toward peace, international cooperation, and the advancement of science."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall transmit its text to the Senate for consideration and approval in the near future.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that may lead to peace with justice.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Certainly it is not necessary to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of any nation; likewise we reject any attempt to impose its system on us or on other peoples by force or subversion.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,This concern for the freedom of other peoples is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with more than forty other nations in a common defense effort.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Not for a moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these countries; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitments to them.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We and our friends are, of course, concerned with self-defense."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Growing out of this concern is the realization that all people of the Free World have a great stake in the progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help from, and finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their hostility to freedom."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Their natural desire for a better life must not be frustrated by withholding from them necessary technical and investment assistance.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"This is a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide help."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In recent years America's partners and friends in Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Their newly found economic strength is eloquent testimony to the striking success of the policies of economic cooperation which we and they have pursued.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of the early postwar years.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,No longer is the United States the only major industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the resources so urgently needed in the newly-developing countries.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"To remain secure and prosperous themselves, wealthy nations must extend the kind of cooperation to the less fortunate members that will inspire hope, confidence and progress."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"A rich nation can for a time, without noticeable damage to itself, pursue a course of self-indulgence, making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens-- thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"But the enmities it will incur, the isolation into which it will descend, and the internal moral and physical softness that will be engendered, will, in the long term, bring it to disaster."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,America did not become great through softness and self-indulgence.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Her miraculous progress and achievements flow from other qualities far more worthy and substantial: adherence to principles and methods consonant with our religious philosophy a satisfaction in hard work the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile causes the courage to meet every challenge to her progress the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own best interests.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"To us and to every nation of the Free World, rich or poor, these qualities are necessary today as never before if we are to march together to greater security, prosperity and peace."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I believe the industrial countries are ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing countries to achieve progress.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The immediate need for this kind of cooperation is underscored by the strain in our international balance of payments.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our surplus from foreign business transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas, to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the less developed nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments approached $4 billion.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Continuing deficits of anything like this magnitude would, over time, impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the Free World."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We must meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world trade.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Further, we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free World to work together in a new cooperative endeavor to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,This will provide for better sharing of this burden and for still further profitable trade.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"New nations, and others struggling with the problems of development, will progress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess the will and use their own resources to fulfill it."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned; there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"But, just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier years, so now do those new and emerging nations that have this faith and determination deserve help."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Over the last fifteen years, twenty nations have gained political independence."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Others are doing so each year.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Most of them are woefully lacking in technical capacity and in investment capital; without Free World support in these matters they cannot effectively progress in freedom.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Respecting their need, one of the major focal points of our concern is the South Asian region."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here, in two nations alone, are almost five hundred million people, all working, and working hard, to raise their standards, and in doing so, to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"I cannot express to you the depth of my conviction that, in our own and Free World interests, we must cooperate with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions, as expressed in their different multi-year plans."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Through the World Bank and other instrumentalities, as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help, we must squarely face this titanic challenge."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"All of us must realize, of course, that development in freedom by the newly emerging nations, is no mere matter of obtaining outside financial assistance."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,An indispensable element in this process is a strong and continuing determination on the part of these nations to exercise the national discipline necessary for any sustained development period.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,These qualities of determination are particularly essential because of the fact that the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious rather than revolutionary.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, everyone should be aware that the development process is no short term phenomenon."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Many years are required for even the most favorably situated countries.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"I shall continue to urge the American people, in the interests of their own security, prosperity and peace, to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully supported."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Free World decisions in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Other countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar needs."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations which are prepared to assist in the development effort.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,During the past year I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western Nations.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation could help with initial studies."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The goal is to enlist all available economic resources in the industrialized Free World--especially private investment capital.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"But I repeat that this help, no matter how great, can be lastingly effective only if it is used as a supplement to the strength of spirit and will of the people of the newly-developing nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,By extending this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,No more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be imagined.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"If we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have already achieved a high state of economic advancement, we will make brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security, freedom and peace."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Otherwise, the outlook could be dark indeed."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We face what may be a turning point in history, and we must act decisively."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives only from a position of broadly based strength.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"No matter how earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating the issue of arms reduction."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Until tangible and mutually enforceable arms reduction measures are worked out, we will not weaken the means of defending our institutions."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,America possesses an enormous defense power.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,It is my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against us unless we should be so foolish as to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is world-wide knowledge that any nation which might be tempted today to attack the United States, even though our country might sustain great losses, would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"But I once again assure all peoples and all nations that the United States, except in defense, will never turn loose this destructive power."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"During the past year, our long-range striking power, unmatched today in manned bombers, has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In fourteen recent test launchings, at ranges of over 5,000 miles, Atlas has been striking on an average within two miles of the target."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,This is less than the length of a jet runway--well within the circle of total destruction.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Such performance is a great tribute to American scientists and engineers, who in the past five years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missiles, where America had none before."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"This year, moreover, growing numbers of nuclear-powered submarines will enter our active forces, some to be armed with Polaris missiles."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"These remarkable ships and weapons, ranging the oceans, will be capable of accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Impossible to destroy by surprise attack, they will become one of our most effective sentinels for peace."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"To meet situations of less than general nuclear war, we continue to maintain our carrier forces, our many service units abroad, our always ready Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, and the civilian components."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly but necessary process, and is scheduled to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The deployment of a portion of these forces beyond our shores, on land and sea, is persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies for collective security."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Moreover, I have directed that steps be taken to program our military assistance to these allies on a longer range basis."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,This is necessary for a sounder collective defense system.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Next I refer to our effort in space exploration, which is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research and development."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"First, America has made great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,These discoveries are of present interest chiefly to the scientific community; but they are important foundation-stones for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Second, our military missile program, going forward so successfully, does not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engines, which are so necessary in distant space exploration."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I am assured by experts that the thrust of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Third, the United States is pressing forward in the development of large rocket engines to place much heavier vehicles into space for exploration purposes."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fourth, in the meantime, it is necessary to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately surrounding the earth."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Using launch systems presently available, we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather; satellite relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the globe; for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the data we seek."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,This is the area holding the most promise for early and useful applications of space technology.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Fifth, we have just completed a year's experience with our new space law."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I believe it deficient in certain particulars and suggested improvements will be submitted shortly.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires the continuous strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, and economic sinews of American life."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The steady purpose of our society is to assure justice, before God, for every individual."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We must be ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the giant issues of the day.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"A year ago, when I met with you, the nation was emerging from an economic downturn, even though the signs of resurgent prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Today our surging strength is apparent to everyone. 1960 promises to be the most prosperous year in our history.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet we continue to be afflicted by nagging disorders.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Among current problems that require solution are: the need to protect the public interest in situations of prolonged labor-management stalemate; the persistent refusal to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of American agriculture; the continuing threat of inflation, together with the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility; in certain instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection of the law."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Every American was disturbed by the prolonged dispute in the steel industry and the protracted delay in reaching a settlement.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We are all relieved that a settlement has at last been achieved in that industry.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Percentagewise, by this settlement the increase to the steel companies in employment costs is lower than in any prior wage settlement since World War II."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,It is also gratifying to note that despite the increase in wages and benefits several of the major steel producers have announced that there will be no increase in steel prices at this time.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The national interest demands that in the period of industrial peace which has been assured by the new contract both management and labor make every possible effort to increase efficiency and productivity in the manufacture of steel so that price increases can be avoided.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,One of the lessons of this story is that the potential danger to the entire Nation of longer and greater strikes must be met.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,To insure against such possibilities we must of course depend primarily upon the good commonsense of the responsible individuals.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is my intention to encourage regular discussions between management and labor outside the bargaining table, to consider the interest of the public as well as their mutual interest in the maintenance of industrial peace, price stability and economic growth."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"To me, it seems almost absurd for the United States to recognize the need, and so earnestly to seek, for cooperation among the nations unless we can achieve voluntary, dependable, abiding cooperation among the important segments of our own free society."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Failure to face up to basic issues in areas other than those of labor-management can cause serious strains on the firm freedom supports of our society.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I refer to agriculture as one of these areas.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our basic farm laws were written 27 years ago, in an emergency effort to redress hardship caused by a world-wide depression."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,They were continued--and their economic distortions intensified--during World War II in order to provide incentives for production of food needed to sustain a war-torn free world.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Today our farm problem is totally different.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,It is that of effectively adjusting to the changes caused by a scientific revolution.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"When the original farm laws were written, an hour's farm labor produced only one-fourth as much wheat as at present."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Farm legislation is woefully out-of-date, ineffective, and expensive."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"For years we have gone on with an outmoded system which not only has failed to protect farm income, but also has produced soaring, threatening surpluses."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Our farms have been left producing for war while America has long been at peace.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Once again I urge Congress to enact legislation that will gear production more closely to markets, make costly surpluses more manageable, provide greater freedom in farm operations, and steadily achieve increased net farm incomes."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Another issue that we must meet squarely is that of living within our means.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"This requires restraint in expenditure, constant reassessment of priorities, and the maintenance of stable prices."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We must prevent inflation.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Here is an opponent of so many guises that it is sometimes difficult to recognize.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,But our clear need is to stop continuous and general price rises--a need that all of us can see and feel.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,To prevent steadily rising costs and prices calls for stern self-discipline by every citizen.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"No person, city, state, or organized group can afford to evade the obligation to resist inflation, for every American pays its crippling tax."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Inflation's ravages do not end at the water's edge.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Increases in prices of the goods we sell abroad threaten to drive us out of markets that once were securely ours.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Whether domestic prices, so high as to be noncompetitive, result from demands for too-high profit margins or from increased labor costs that outrun growth in productivity, the final result is seriously damaging to the nation."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We must fight inflation as we would a fire that imperils our home.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Only by so doing can we prevent it from destroying our salaries, savings, pensions and insurance, and from gnawing away the very roots of a free, healthy economy and the nation's security."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,One major method by which the Federal government can counter inflation and rising prices is to insure that its expenditures are below its revenues.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The debt with which we are now confronted is about 290 billion dollars.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"With interest charges alone now costing taxpayers about $9 1/2 billions, it is clear that this debt growth must stop."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"You will be glad to know that despite the unsettling influences of the recent steel strike, we estimate that our accounts will show, on June 30, this year, a favorable balance of approximately $200 million."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I shall present to the Congress for 1961 a balanced budget.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the area of defense, expenditures continue at the record peace-time levels of the last several years."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"With a single exception, expenditures in every major category of Health, Education and Welfare will be equal or greater than last year."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In Space expenditures the amounts are practically doubled.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"But the over-all guiding goal of this budget is national need--not response to specific group, local or political insistence."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Expenditure increases, other than those I have indicated, are largely accounted for by the increased cost of legislation previously enacted."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"I repeat, this budget will be a balanced one."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Expenditures will be 79 billion 8 hundred million.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The amount of income over outgo, described in the budget as a Surplus, to be applied against our national debt, is 4 billion 2 hundred million."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Personally, I do not feel that any amount can be properly called a ""Surplus"" as long as the nation is in debt."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"I prefer to think of such an item as ""reduction on our children's inherited mortgage."" Once we have established such payments as normal practice, we can profitably make improvements in our tax structure and thereby truly reduce the heavy burdens of taxation. [In any event, this one reduction will save taxpayers, each year, approximately 2 hundred million dollars in interest costs.] This budget will help ease pressures in our credit and capital markets."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,It will enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of our economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability to be fiscally responsible.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In the management of the huge public debt the Treasury is unfortunately not free of artificial barriers.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Its ability to deal with the difficult problems in this field has been weakened greatly by the unwillingness of the Congress to remove archaic restrictions.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The need for a freer hand in debt management is even more urgent today because the costs of the undesirable financing practices which the Treasury has been forced into are mounting.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Removal of this roadblock has high priority in my legislative recommendations.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Still another issue relates to civil rights.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In all our hopes and plans for a better world we all recognize that provincial and racial prejudices must be combatted.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In the long perspective of history, the right to vote has been one of the strongest pillars of a free society."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Our first duty is to protect this right against all encroachment.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In spite of constitutional guarantees, and notwithstanding much progress of recent years, bias still deprives some persons in this country of equal protection of the laws."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Early in your last session I recommended legislation which would help eliminate several practices discriminating against the basic rights of Americans.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The Civil Rights Commission has developed additional constructive recommendations.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I hope that these will be among the matters to be seriously considered in the current session.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I trust that Congress will thus signal to the world that our Government is striving for equality under law for all our people.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Each year and in many ways our nation continues to undergo profound change and growth.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In the past 18 months we have hailed the entry of two more States of the Union--Alaska and Hawaii.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We salute these two western stars proudly.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Our vigorous expansion, which we all welcome as a sign of health and vitality, is many-sided."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We are, for example, witnessing explosive growth in metropolitan areas."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,By 1975 the metropolitan areas of the United States will occupy twice the territory they do today.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The roster of urban problems with which they must cope is staggering.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"They involve water supply, cleaning the air, adjusting local tax systems, providing for essential educational, cultural, and social services, and destroying those conditions which breed delinquency and crime."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In meeting these, we must, if we value our historic freedoms, keep within the traditional framework of our Federal system with powers divided between the national and state governments."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The uniqueness of this system may confound the casual observer, but it has worked effectively for nearly 200 years."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I do not doubt that our urban and other perplexing problems can be solved in the traditional American method.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In doing so we must realize that nothing is really solved and ruinous tendencies are set in motion by yielding to the deceptive bait of the ""easy"" Federal tax dollar."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Our educational system provides a ready example.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"All recognize the vital necessity of having modern school plants, well-qualified and adequately compensated teachers, and of using the best possible teaching techniques and curricula."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We cannot be complacent about educating our youth.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,But the route to better trained minds is not through the swift administration of a Federal hypodermic or sustained financial transfusion.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"The educational process, essentially a local and personal responsibility, cannot be made to leap ahead by crash, centralized governmental action."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The Administration has proposed a carefully reasoned program for helping eliminate current deficiencies.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is designed to stimulate classroom construction, not by substitution of Federal dollars for state and local funds, but by incentives to extend and encourage state and local efforts."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,This approach rejects the notion of Federal domination or control.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"It is workable, and should appeal to every American interested in advancement of our educational system in the traditional American way."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I urge the Congress to take action upon it.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,There is one other subject concerning which I renew a recommendation I made in my State of the Union Message last January.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I then advised the Congress of my purpose to intensify our efforts to replace force with a rule of law among nations.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"From many discussions abroad, I am convinced that purpose is widely and deeply shared by other peoples and nations of the world."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,In the same Message I stated that our efforts would include a reexamination of our own relation to the International Court of Justice.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The Court was established by the United Nations to decide international legal disputes between nations.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In 1946 we accepted the Court's jurisdiction, but subject to a reservation of the right to determine unilaterally whether a matter lies essentially within domestic jurisdiction."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"There is pending before the Senate, a Resolution which would repeal our present self-judging reservation."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I support that Resolution and urge its prompt passage.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"If this is done, I intend to urge similar acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction by every member of the United Nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Here perhaps it is not amiss for me to say to the Members of the Congress, in this my final year of office, a word about the institutions we respectively represent and the meaning which the relationships between our two branches has for the days ahead."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,I am not unique as a President in having worked with a Congress controlled by the opposition party--except that no other President ever did it for quite so long!
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Yet in both personal and official relationships we have weathered the storms of the past five years.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,For this I am grateful.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"My deep concern in the next twelve months, before my successor takes office, is with our joint Congressional-Executive duty to our own and to other nations."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Acting upon the beliefs I have expressed here today, I shall devote my full energies to the tasks at hand, whether these involve travel for promoting greater world understanding, negotiations to reduce international ant discussions and communications with the Congress and the American people on issues both domestic and foreign."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"In pursuit of these objectives, I look forward to, and shall dedicate myself to, a close and constructive association with the Congress."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Every minute spent in irrelevant interbranch wrangling is precious time taken from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policies for our national survival and progress.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,We seek a common goal--brighter opportunity for our own citizens and a world peace with justice for all.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Before us and our friends is the challenge of an ideology which, for more than four decades, has trumpeted abroad its purpose of gaining ultimate victory over all forms of government at variance with its own."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We realize that however much we repudiate the tenets of imperialistic Communism, it represents a gigantic enterprise grimly pursued by leaders who compel its subjects to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit and personal desires for some hoped-for advantage in the future."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The Communists can present an array of material accomplishments over the past fifteen years that lends a false persuasiveness to many of their glittering promises to the uncommitted peoples.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The competition they provide is formidable.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,But in our scale of values we place freedom first--our whole national existence and development have been geared to that basic concept and are responsible for the position of free world leadership to which we have succeeded.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,It is the highest prize that any nation can possess; it is one that Communism can never offer.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"And America's record of material accomplishment in freedom is written not only in the unparalleled prosperity of our own nation, but in the many billions we have devoted to the reconstruction of Free World economies wrecked by World War II and in the effective help of many more billions we have given in saving the independence of many others threatened by outside domination."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,Assuredly we have the capacity for handling the problems in the new era of the world's history we are now entering.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"But we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly, regardless of personal sacrifice."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,The fissure that divides our political planet is deep and wide.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We live, moreover, in a sea of semantic disorder in which old labels no longer faithfully describe."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"Police states are called ""people's democracies."" Armed conquest of free people is called ""liberation."" Such slippery slogans make more difficult the problem of communicating true faith, facts and beliefs."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"We must make clear our peaceful intentions, our aspirations for a better world."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"So doing, we must use language to enlighten the mind, not as the instrument of the studied innuendo and distorter of truth."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,And we must live by what we say.
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"On my recent visit to distant lands I found one statesman after another eager to tell me of the elements of their government that had been borrowed from our American Constitution, and from the indestructible ideals set forth in our Declaration of Independence."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"As a nation we take pride that our own constitutional system, and the ideals which sustain it, have been long viewed as a fountainhead of freedom."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"By our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust, ever mindful that an accumulation of seemingly minor encroachments upon freedom gradually could break down the entire fabric of a free society."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"So persuaded, we shall get on with the task before us."
1960,Eisenhower,Republican,"So dedicated, and with faith in the Almighty, humanity shall one day achieve the unity in freedom to which all men have aspired from the dawn of time."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,PRESIDENT JOHN F.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"KENNEDY'S SPECIAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON URGENT NATIONAL NEEDS May 25, 1961 Mr."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Vice President, my copartners in Government, gentlemen-and ladies: The Constitution imposes upon me the obligation to ""from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union."" While this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair, this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,These are extraordinary times.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,And we face an extraordinary challenge.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom's cause.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,No role in history could be more difficult or more important.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We stand for freedom.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,That is our conviction for ourselves--that is our only commitment to others.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"No friend, no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We are not against any man--or any nation--or any system--except as it is hostile to freedom.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Nor am I here to present a new military doctrine, bearing any one name or aimed at any one area."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I am here to promote the freedom doctrine.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe--Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East--the lands of the rising peoples."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Their revolution is the greatest in human history.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"They seek an end to injustice, tyranny, and exploitation."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"More than an end, they seek a beginning."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"And theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the Cold War, and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,For the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; nor did they create the conditions which compel it.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave--to capture it for themselves.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Yet their aggression is more often concealed than open.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,They have fired no missiles; and their troops are seldom seen.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"They send arms, agitators, aid, technicians and propaganda to every troubled area."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But where fighting is required, it is usually done by others--by guerrillas striking at night, by assassins striking alone--assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in Vietnam alone--by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists, who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations. [At this point the following paragraph, which appears in the text as signed and transmitted to the Senate and House of Representatives, was omitted in the reading of the message: They possess a powerful intercontinental striking force, large forces for conventional war, a well-trained underground in nearly every country, the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose, the capacity for quick decisions, a closed society without dissent or free information, and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"They make the most of their scientific successes, their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"They prey on unstable or unpopular governments, unsealed, or unknown boundaries, unfilled hopes, convulsive change, massive poverty, illiteracy, unrest and frustration.] With these formidable weapons, the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory--to exploit, to control, and finally to destroy the hopes of the world's newest nations; and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence--a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"And in that contest, we cannot stand aside."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"We stand, as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings, for the independence and equality of all nations."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,This nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,And we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,There is no single simple policy which meets this challenge.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides--that extending our commitments does not always increase our security--that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat--that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion--that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own--and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Yet there is much we can do--and must do.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,The proposals I bring before you are numerous and varied.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,They arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Taken together, I believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I am here to ask the help of this Congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,II.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AT HOME The first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"An affirmative anti-recession program, initiated with your cooperation, supported the natural forces in the private sector; and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,The recession has been halted.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Recovery is under way.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,But the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Large-scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large-scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"I am therefore transmitting to the Congress a new Manpower Development and Training program, to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers, particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four-year period, in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar, halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"During the last two months, our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars, compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We must maintain this progress--and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"As recovery progresses, there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,These we cannot afford.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,They will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Labor and management must--and I am confident that they will--pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I look to the President's Advisory Committee on Labor Management Policy to give a strong lead in this direction.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Moreover, if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions, it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards; and I request the cooperation of the Congress in this regard--to refrain from adding funds or programs, desirable as they may be, to the Budget--to end the postal deficit, as my predecessor also recommended, through increased rates--a deficit incidentally, this year, which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that I am submitting today--to provide full pay-as-you-go highway financing--and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased; and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,III.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS ABROAD I stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,For no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,The most skillful counter-guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But for those who share this view, we stand ready now, as we have in the past, to provide generously of our skills, and our capital, and our food to assist the peoples of the less-developed nations to reach their goals in freedom--to help them before they are engulfed in crisis."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,This is also our great opportunity in 1961.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we grasp it, then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But if we do not pursue it, and if they do not pursue it, the bankruptcy of unstable governments, one by one, and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Earlier in the year, I outlined to the Congress a new program for aiding emerging nations; and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program, to establish a new Act for International Development, and to add to the figures previously requested, in view of the swift pace of critical events, an additional 250 million dollars for a Presidential Contingency Fund, to be used only upon a Presidential determination in each case, with regular and complete reports to the Congress in each case, when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee--as illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia--and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,The total amount requested--now raised to 2..65 billion dollars--is both minimal and crucial.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I do not see how anyone who is concerned--as we all are--about the growing threats to freedom around the globe--and who is asking what more we can do as a people--can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,IV.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"All that I have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world-wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind, or have alien ideals forced upon them."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,That struggle has highlighted the role of our Information Agency.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full, but increased by 2 million, 400 thousand dollars, to a total of 121 million dollars."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,This new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and Southeast Asia.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,These tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In Latin America, we are proposing to increase our Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week, compared to 42 hours today, none of which is in Portuguese, the language of about one-third of the people of South America."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The Soviets, Red Chinese and satellites already broadcast into Latin America more than 134 hours a week in Spanish and Portuguese."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Communist China alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Moreover, powerful propaganda broadcasts from Havana now are heard throughout Latin America, encouraging new revolutions in several countries."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Similarly, in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Our interest is in the truth.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,V.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR SELF-DEFENSE But while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas, others talk of arms and threaten war."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,So we have learned to keep our defenses strong--and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self-defense.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,The events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The center of freedom's defense is our network of world alliances, extending from NATO, recommended by a Democratic President and approved by a Republican Congress, to SEATO, recommended by a Republican President and approved by a Democratic Congress."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,These alliances were constructed in the 1940's and 1950's--it is our task and responsibility in the 1960's to strengthen them.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,To meet the changing conditions of power--and power relationships have changed--we have endorsed an increased emphasis on NATO's conventional strength.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,At the same time we are affirming our conviction that the NATO nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"I have made clear our intention to commit to the NATO command, for this purpose, the 5 Polaris submarines originally suggested by President Eisenhower, with the possibility, if needed, of more to come."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Second, a major part of our partnership for self-defense is the Military Assistance Program."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The main burden of local defense against local attack, subversion, insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats, our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking, our Military Assistance Program can be of help."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But this program, like economic assistance, needs a new emphasis."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It cannot be extended without regard to the social, political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies, not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader's desire for military display."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"And military assistance can, in addition to its military purposes, make a contribution to economic progress, as do our own Army Engineers."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In an earlier message, I requested 1.6 billion dollars for Military Assistance, stating that this would maintain existing force levels, but that I could not foresee how much more might be required."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It is now clear that this is not enough.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The present crisis in Southeast Asia, on which the Vice President has made a valuable report--the rising threat of communism in Latin America--the increased arms traffic in Africa--and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the Communist bloc in Asia and the Middle East--all make clear the dimension of our needs."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I therefore request the Congress to provide a total of 1.885 billion dollars for Military Assistance in the coming fiscal year--an amount less than that requested a year ago--but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,This must be prudently and wisely spent--and that will be our common endeavor.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time, and I recognize the strong pressures against it; but this battle is far from over, it is reaching a crucial stage, and I believe we should participate in it."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,VI.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"OUR OWN MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SHIELD In line with these developments, I have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non-nuclear aggression."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the conventional field, with one exception, I find no present need for large new levies of men."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,What is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Therefore, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the Army's divisional structure, to increase its non-nuclear firepower, to improve its tactical mobility in any environment, to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat, to facilitate its coordination with our major allies, and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in Europe and bring their equipment up to date, and new airborne brigades in both the Pacific and Europe."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"And secondly, I am asking the Congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re-equip this new Army structure with the most modern material."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"New helicopters, new armored personnel carriers, and new howitzers, for example, must be obtained now."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Third, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to expand rapidly and substantially, in cooperation with our Allies, the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of non-nuclear war, paramilitary operations and sub-limited or unconventional wars."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,In addition our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Fourth, the Army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"When these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened, two combat-equipped divisions, plus their supporting forces, a total of 89,000 men, could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks' notice--2 more divisions with but 5 weeks' notice--and six additional divisions and their supporting forces, making a total of 10 divisions, could be deployable with less than 8 weeks' notice."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In short, these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the Army in less than two months, compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Fifth, to enhance the already formidable ability of the Marine Corps to respond to limited war emergencies, I am asking the Congress for 60 million dollars to increase the Marine Corps strength to 190,000 men."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"This will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three Marine divisions and three air wings, and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion, if necessary for self-defense."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Finally, to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self-defense in an age of hidden perils, our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed, and its coordination with other elements of policy assured."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The Congress and the American people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization, policies, and control are necessary."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,VII.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,CIVIL DEFENSE One major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,This problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs, but we have never adopted a consistent policy."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy, indifference and skepticism; while, at the same time, many of the civil defense plans have been so far-reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,This Administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It cannot be obtained cheaply.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,And it cannot deter a nuclear attack.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we have that strength, civil defense is not needed to deter an attack."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we should ever lack it, civil defense would not be an adequate substitute."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,But this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"And the history of this planet, and particularly the history of the 20th century, is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack, a miscalculation, an accidental war, [or a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger] which cannot be either foreseen or deterred."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable--as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It is insurance we trust will never be needed--but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Once the validity of this concept is recognized, there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation-wide long-range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large-scale nuclear attack.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds, but also sound organizational arrangements."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Therefore, under the authority vested in me by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, I am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense, the Secretary of Defense."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is important that this function remain civilian, in nature and leadership; and this feature will not be changed."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,The Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"To more accurately describe its role, its title should be changed to the Office of Emergency Planning."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"As soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests, such requests will be transmitted to the Congress for a much strengthened Federal-State civil defense program."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Such a program will provide Federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing, structures, and it will include, where appropriate, incorporation of shelter in Federal buildings, new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with Federal assistance, and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in State and local and private buildings."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Federal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests; and they will increase sharply in subsequent years.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Financial participation will also be required from State and local governments and from private citizens.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But no insurance is cost-free; and every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort, time and money."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"For myself, I am convinced that it does."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,VIII.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,DISARMAMENT I cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope: the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Our aims do not prepare for war--they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,That is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"At Geneva, in cooperation with the United Kingdom, we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the Soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty--the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Up to now, their response has not been what we hoped, but Mr."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Dean returned last night to Geneva, and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Meanwhile, we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda--to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,To this end I shall send to the Congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged Disarmament Agency.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,IX.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"SPACE Finally, if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Since early in my term, our efforts in space have been under review."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"With the advice of the Vice President, who is Chairman of the National Space Council, we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Now it is time to take longer strides--time for a great new American enterprise--time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshalled the national resources required for such leadership.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of leadtime, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by the feat of astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,But this is not merely a race.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"I therefore ask the Congress, above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities, to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals: First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations--explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon--if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,For all of us must work to put him there.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Secondly, an additional 23 million dollars, together with 7 million dollars already available, will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Third, an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership, by accelerating the use of space satellites for world-wide communications."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Fourth, an additional 75 million dollars--of which 53 million dollars is for the Weather Bureau--will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world-wide weather observation."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Let it be clear--and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make--let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action, a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs: 531 million dollars in fiscal '62--an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we are to go only half way, or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Now this is a choice which this country must make, and I am confident that under the leadership of the Space Committees of the Congress, and the Appropriating Committees, that you will consider the matter carefully."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,It is a most important decision that we make as a nation.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space, and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I believe we should go to the moon.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment, to which we have given attention over many weeks and months, because it is a heavy burden, and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we are not, we should decide today and this year."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"This decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It means a degree of dedication, organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages, inflated costs of material or talent, wasteful interagency rivalries, or a high turnover of key personnel."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,New objectives and new money cannot solve these problems.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"They could in fact, aggravate them further--unless every scientist, every engineer, every serviceman, every technician, contractor, and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,X.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"CONCLUSION In conclusion, let me emphasize one point."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is not a pleasure for any President of the United States, as I am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors, to come before the Congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,I came to this conclusion with some reluctance.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"But in my judgment, this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe, and it is the obligation, I believe, of the President of the United States to at least make his recommendations to the Members of the Congress, so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"You must decide yourselves, as I have decided, and I am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that I have decided or not, that your judgment--as my judgment--is reached on what is in the best interests of our country."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In conclusion, let me emphasize one point: that we are determined, as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed--and whatever the peril and set-backs, we have some very large advantages."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"The first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty--and since the beginning of history, and particularly since the end of the Second World War, liberty has been winning out all over the globe."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,A second real asset is that we are not alone.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,We have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,May I cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally I am about to visit--France.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"I look forward to my visit to France, and to my discussion with a great Captain of the Western World, President de Gaulle, as a meeting of particular significance, permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world-wide peace and liberty."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,Such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity--they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,A third asset is our desire for peace.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is sincere, and I believe the world knows it."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"We are proving it in our patience at the test ban table, and we are proving it in the UN where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization's usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"In these and other instances, the response of our opponents has not been encouraging."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"Yet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible, though our credulity is limited that our hopes for peace are unfailing, while our determination to protect our security is resolute."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,For these reasons I have long thought it wise to meet with the Soviet Premier for a personal exchange of views.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,A meeting in Vienna turned out to be convenient for us both; and the Austrian government has kindly made us welcome.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"No formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken; but we will make clear America's enduring concern is for both peace and freedom--that we are anxious to live in harmony with the Russian people--that we seek no conquests, no satellites, no riches--that we seek only the day when ""nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."" Finally, our greatest asset in this struggle is the American people--their willingness to pay the price for these programs--to understand and accept a long struggle--to share their resources with other less fortunate people--to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes I have requested--to exercise self-restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices, or over-producing certain crops, or spreading military secrets, or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages--to serve in the Peace Corps or the Armed Services or the Federal Civil Service or the Congress--to strive for excellence in their schools, in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children--to take part in Civil Defense--to pay higher postal rates, and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers' salaries, in order to strengthen our society--to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders, with an image of America--and I want that image, and I know you do, to be affirmative and positive--and, finally, to practice democracy at home, in all States, with all races, to respect each other and to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience, or some hardship, or some sacrifice."
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,But they have responded and you in the Congress have responded to your duty--and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands.
1961,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is heartening to know, as I journey abroad, that our country is united in its commitment to freedom and is ready to do its duty."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,PRESIDENT JOHN F.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,KENNEDY'S ANNUAL ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION This week we begin anew our joint and separate efforts to build the American future.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But, sadly, we build without a man who linked a long past with the present and looked strongly to the future. ""Mister Sam"" Rayburn is gone."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Neither this House nor the Nation is the same without him.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Members of the Congress, the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We are all trustees for the American people, custodians of the American heritage."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,It is my task to report the State of the Union - to improve it is the task of us all.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the past year, I have travelled not only across our own land but to other lands - to the North and the South, and across the seas."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And I have found - as I am sure you have, in your travels - that people everywhere, in spite of occasional disappointments, look to us - not to our wealth or power, but to the splendor of our ideals."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,For our Nation is commissioned by history to be either an observer of freedom's failure or the cause of its success.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our overriding obligation in the months ahead is to fulfill the world's hopes by fulfilling our own faith.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY That task must begin at home.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"For if we cannot fulfill our own ideals here, we cannot expect others to accept them."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And when the youngest child alive today has grown to the cares of manhood, our position in the world will be determined first of all by what provisions we make today - for his education, his health, and his opportunities for a good home and a good job and a good life."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"At home, we began the year in the valley of recession - we completed it on the high road of recovery and growth."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"With the help of new congressionally approved or administratively increased stimulants to our economy, the number of major surplus labor areas has declined from 101 to 60; nonagricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs; and the average factory work-week has risen to well over 40 hours."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,At year's end the economy which Mr.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Khrushchev once called a ""stumbling horse"" was racing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrial production."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We are gratified - but we are not satisfied.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Too many unemployed are still looking for the blessings of prosperity.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"As those who leave our schools and farms demand new jobs, automation takes old jobs away."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To expand our growth and job opportunities, I urge on the Congress three measures: First, the Manpower Training and Development Act, to stop the waste of able-bodied men and women who want to work, but whose only skill has been replaced by a machine, or moved with a mill, or shut down with a mine; Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and place not only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and out of work, but the twenty-six million young Americans entering the labor market in this decade; and Third, the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery and equipment, which, combined with planned revisions of depreciation allowances, will spur our modernization, our growth, and our ability to compete abroad."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Moreover - pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery - let us not forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last 7 years.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining - by filling three basic gaps in our anti-recession protection.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We need: First, Presidential standby authority, subject to congressional veto, to adjust personal income tax rates downward within a specified range and time, to slow down an economic decline before it has dragged us all down; Second, Presidential standby authority, upon a given rise in the rate of unemployment, to accelerate Federal and federally-aided capital improvement programs; and Third, a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensation system - to maintain for our fellow citizens searching for a job who cannot find it, their purchasing power and their living standards without constant resort - as we have seen in recent years by the Congress and the administrations - to temporary supplements."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we enact this six-part program, we can show the whole world that a free economy need not be an unstable economy - that a free system need not leave men unemployed - and that a free society is not only the most productive but the most stable form of organization yet fashioned by man."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,FIGHTING INFLATION But recession is only one enemy of a free economy - inflation is another.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices held almost steady - and wholesale prices declined."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This is the best record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end of World War II.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Inflation too often follows in the shadow of growth - while price stability is made easy by stagnation or controls.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But we mean to maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public spirit of business and labor - keeping their total increases in wages and profits in step with productivity.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,There is no single statistical test to guide each company and each union.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But I strongly urge them - for their country's interest, and for their own - to apply the test of the public interest to these transactions."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Within this same framework of growth and wage-price stability: This administration has helped keep our economy competitive by widening the access of small business to credit and Government contracts, and by stepping up the drive against monopoly, price-fixing, and racketeering; We will submit a Federal Pay Reform bill aimed at giving our classified, postal, and other employees new pay scales more comparable to those of private industry; We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level incurred after the last recession in 1958; and, finally, I am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced Federal Budget."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on appropriations, and on three sources of income in particular: First, an increase in postal rates, to end the postal deficit; Secondly, passage of the tax reforms previously urged, to remove unwarranted tax preferences, and to apply to dividends and to interest the same withholding requirements we have long applied to wages; Third, extension of the present excise and corporation tax rates, except for those changes - which will be recommended in a message - affecting transportation."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,GETTING AMERICA MOVING But a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,They require progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify our strength.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"CITIES A strong America depends on its cities - America's glory, and sometimes America's shame."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for decay, we have stepped up existing urban renewal and housing programs, and launched new ones - redoubled the attack on water pollution - speeded aid to airports, hospitals, highways, and our declining mass transit systems - and secured new weapons to combat organized crime, racketeering, and youth delinquency, assisted by the coordinated and hard-hitting efforts of our investigative services: the FBI, the Internal Revenue, the Bureau of Narcotics, and many others."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We shall need further anti-crime, mass transit, and transportation legislation - and new tools to fight air pollution."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And with all this effort under way, both equity and common sense require that our nation's urban areas - containing three-fourths of our population - sit as equals at the Cabinet table."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,I urge a new Department of Urban Affairs and Housing.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,American farmers took heart in 1961 - from a billion dollar rise in farm income - and from a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But we are still operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1 billion a year in carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earnings."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificent productivity of our farms and farmers.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The revolution on our own countryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failures of the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Since 1950 our agricultural output per man-hour has actually doubled!
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Without new, realistic measures, it will someday swamp our farmers and our taxpayers in a national scandal or a farm depression."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm program - tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop to the long-range needs of the sixties - and designed to prevent chaos in the sixties with a program of common sense."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We also need for the sixties - if we are to bequeath our full national estate to our heirs - a new long-range conservation and recreation program - expansion of our superb national parks and forests - preservation of our authentic wilderness areas - new starts on water and power projects as our population steadily increases - and expanded REA generation and transmission loans.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"CIVIL RIGHTS But America stands for progress in human rights as well as economic affairs, and a strong America requires the assurance of full and equal rights to all its citizens, of any race or of any color."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This administration has shown as never before how much could be done through the full use of Executive powers - through the enforcement of laws already passed by the Congress - through persuasion, negotiation, and litigation, to secure the constitutional rights of all: the right to vote, the right to travel without hindrance across State lines, and the right to free public education."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,I issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal employment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The Vice President's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary ""Plans for Progress"" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving a quiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional, supervisory, and other job opportunities."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But there is much more to be done - by the Executive, by the courts, and by the Congress."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Among the bills now pending before you, on which the executive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of strengthening these basic rights which have our full support."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The right to vote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary devices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and poll taxes."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the Emancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the Government - and every citizen - portray that ""righteousness does exalt a nation."" HEALTH AND WELFARE Finally, a strong America cannot neglect the aspirations of its citizens - the welfare of the needy, the health care of the elderly, the education of the young."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,For we are not developing the Nation's wealth for its own sake.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Wealth is the means - and people are the ends.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,All our material riches will avail us little if we do not use them to expand the opportunities of our people.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Last year, we improved the diet of needy people - provided more hot lunches and fresh milk to school children - built more college dormitories - and, for the elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, health services, and social security."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But we have just begun.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To help those least fortunate of all, I am recommending a new public welfare program, stressing services instead of support, rehabilitation instead of relief, and training for useful work instead of prolonged dependency."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists - and this is a matter which should concern us all - and expand research, I urge action to aid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish new National Institutes of Health."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a mass immunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancient enemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To protect our consumers from the careless and the unscrupulous, I shall recommend improvements in the Food and Drug laws - strengthening inspection and standards, halting unsafe and worthless products, preventing misleading labels, and cracking down on the illicit sale of habit-forming drugs."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But in matters of health, no piece of unfinished business is more important or more urgent than the enactment under the social security system of health insurance for the aged."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"For our older citizens have longer and more frequent illnesses, higher hospital and medical bills and too little income to pay them."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Private health insurance helps very few - for its cost is high and its coverage limited.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Public welfare cannot help those too proud to seek relief but hard-pressed to pay their own bills.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Nor can their children or grandchildren always sacrifice their own health budgets to meet this constant drain.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Social security has long helped to meet the hardships of retirement, death, and disability."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,I now urge that its coverage be extended without further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,EDUCATION Equally important to our strength is the quality of our education.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Eight million adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This is a disturbing figure - reflected in Selective Service rejection rates - reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,And I shall recommend plans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"I shall also recommend bills to improve educational quality, to stimulate the arts, and, at the college level, to provide Federal loans for the construction of academic facilities and federally financed scholarships."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"If this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Yet nearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10 years.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical levels - now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our families earn less than $5,000."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,They cannot afford such costs - but this Nation cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But excellence in education must begin at the elementary level.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,I sent to the Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school construction and teachers' salaries.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"I believe that bill, which passed the Senate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amount required by our needs and - in terms of across-the-board aid - the maximum scope permitted by our Constitution."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"I therefore see no reason to weaken or withdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session. ""Civilization,"" said H."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,G.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Wells, ""is a race between education and catastrophe."" It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner of that race."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,These are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievances in our national life.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"They are the pattern of our intentions and the foundation of our hopes. ""I believe in democracy,"" said Woodrow Wilson, ""because it releases the energy of every human being."" The dynamic of democracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy of this administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realize his own highest possibilities."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Our program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive employment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational exclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and welfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individual the source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise of American life."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,OUR GOALS ABROAD All of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Since the close of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormented mankind."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But it is not our military might, or our higher standard of living, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,It is our belief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This basic clash of ideas and wills is but one of the forces reshaping our globe - swept as it is by the tides of hope and fear, by crises in the headlines today that become mere footnotes tomorrow."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Both the successes and the setbacks of the past year remain on our agenda of unfinished business.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,For every apparent blessing contains the seeds of danger - every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope - and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Yet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free and independent states - free to choose their own future and their own system, so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Some may choose forms and ways that we would not choose for ourselves - but it is not for us that they are choosing.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We can welcome diversity - the Communists cannot.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,For we offer a world of choice - they offer the world of coercion.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And the way of the past shows clearly that freedom, not coercion, is the wave of the future."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,At times our goal has been obscured by crisis or endangered by conflict - but it draws sustenance from five basic sources of strength: the moral and physical strength of the United States; the united strength of the Atlantic Community; the regional strength of our Hemispheric relations; the creative strength of our efforts in the new and developing nations; the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,OUR MILITARY STRENGTH Our moral and physical strength begins at home as already discussed.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But it includes our military strength as well.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"So long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affairs of men, we must arm to deter others from aggression."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,In the past 12 months our military posture has steadily improved.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We increased the previous defense budget by 15 percent - not in the expectation of war but for the preservation of peace.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We more than doubled our acquisition rate of Polaris submarines - we doubled the production capacity for Minuteman missiles - and increased by 50 percent the number of manned bombers standing ready on a 15 minute alert.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This year the combined force levels planned under our new Defense budget - including nearly three hundred additional Polaris and Minuteman missiles - have been precisely calculated to insure the continuing strength of our nuclear deterrent.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But our strength may be tested at many levels.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We intend to have at all times the capacity to resist non-nuclear or limited attacks - as a complement to our nuclear capacity, not as a substitute."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We have rejected any all-or-nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Thus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's strategic reserve - increased our troops in Europe - built up the Marines - added new sealift and airlift capacity - modernized our weapons and ammunition - expanded our anti-guerrilla forces - and increased the active fleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozen wings.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Because we needed to reach this higher long-term level of readiness more quickly, 155,000 members of the Reserve and National Guard were activated under the Act of this Congress."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Some disruptions and distress were inevitable.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the overwhelming majority bear their burdens - and their Nation's burdens - with admirable and traditional devotion.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised - two Army Divisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty - and substantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the procurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way, identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces; and I urge your approval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall-out shelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,THE UNITED NATIONS But arms alone are not enough to keep the peace - it must be kept by men.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our instrument and our hope is the United Nations - and I see little merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because they dislike our imperfect world.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,For the troubles of a world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And if the organization is weakened, these troubles can only increase."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We may not always agree with every detailed action taken by every officer of the United Nations, or with every voting majority."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But as an institution, it should have in the future, as it has had in the past since its inception, no stronger or more faithful member than the United States of America."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,In 1961 the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in the seat of Hammarskjold - or Red China inside the Assembly - have seen instead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independent Secretariat."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament - for peace-keeping in outer space - for a decade of development effort - the U.N. fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Eighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the U.N. with its gravest challenge.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The prospect was one of chaos - or certain big-power confrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and to others."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within a united Congo.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This is the objective of our policy in this important area.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,No policeman is universally popular - particularly when he uses his stick to restore law and order on his beat.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Those members who are willing to contribute their votes and their views - but very little else - have created a serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special U.N. assessments.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes - and a new U.N.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is to be repaid with interest from these regular assessments."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This is clearly in our interest.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"It will not only keep the U.N. solvent, but require all voting members to pay their fair share of its activities."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Our share of special operations has long been much higher than our share of the annual assessment - and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate obligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve our participation."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"With the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year a great new effort in outer space."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Our aim is not simply to be first on the moon, any more than Charles Lindbergh's real aim was to be the first to Paris."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"His aim was to develop the techniques of our own country and other countries in the field of air and the atmosphere, and our objective in making this effort, which we hope will place one of our citizens on the moon, is to develop in a new frontier of science, commerce and cooperation, the position of the United States and the Free World."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This Nation belongs among the first to explore it, and among the first - if not the first - we shall be."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We are offering our know-how and our cooperation to the United Nations.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our satellites will soon be providing other nations with improved weather observations.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And I shall soon send to the Congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an International Communications Satellite system, in a manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,World order will be secured only when the whole world has laid down these weapons which seem to offer us present security but threaten the future survival of the human race.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,That armistice day seems very far away.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The vast resources of this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying, instead of enriching, human life."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Nor has mankind survived the tests and trials of thousands of years to surrender everything - including its existence - now.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This Nation has the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam on disarmament and nuclear tests - and we will persist until we prevail, until the rule of law has replaced the ever dangerous use of force."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,LATIN AMERICA I turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The Alliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to program.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of hope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country - among workers and farmers as well as diplomats."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We have pledged our help in speeding their economic, educational, and social progress."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The Latin American Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of self-help and self-reform.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To support this historic undertaking, I am proposing - under the authority contained in the bills of the last session of the Congress - a special long-term Alliance for Progress fund of $3 billion."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Combined with our Food for Peace, Export-Import Bank, and other resources, this will provide more than $1 billion a year in new support for the Alliance."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In addition, we have increased twelvefold our Spanish and Portuguese-language broadcasting in Latin America, and improved Hemispheric trade and defense."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And while the blight of communism has been increasingly exposed and isolated in the Americas, liberty has scored a gain."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The people of the Dominican Republic, with our firm encouragement and help, and those of our sister Republics of this Hemisphere are safely passing through the treacherous course from dictatorship through disorder towards democracy."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONS Our efforts to help other new or developing nations, and to strengthen their stand for freedom, have also made progress."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"A newly unified Agency for International Development is reorienting our foreign assistance to emphasize long-term development loans instead of grants, more economic aid instead of military, individual plans to meet the individual needs of the nations, and new standards on what they must do to marshal their own resources."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"A newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in fourteen countries - supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, to give these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of the best that is in our country."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"If there is a problem here, it is that we cannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"A newly expanded Food for Peace Program is feeding the hungry of many lands with the abundance of our productive farms - providing lunches for children in school, wages for economic development, relief for the victims of flood and famine, and a better diet for millions whose daily bread is their chief concern."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"These programs help people; and, by helping people, they help freedom."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The views of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours - but events in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never to write off any nation as lost to the Communists."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,That is the lesson of our time.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whose history, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside ""entangling alliances"" - as we did for more than a century."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"For the independence of nations is a bar to the Communists' ""grand design"" - it is the basis of our own."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the past year, for example, we have urged a neutral and independent Laos - regained there a common policy with our major allies - and insisted that a cease-fire precede negotiations."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"While a workable formula for supervising its independence is still to be achieved, both the spread of war - which might have involved this country also - and a Communist occupation have thus far been prevented."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,A satisfactory settlement in Laos would also help to achieve and safeguard the peace in Viet Nam - where the foe is increasing his tactics of terror - where our own efforts have been stepped up - and where the local government has initiated new programs and reforms to broaden the base of resistance.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The systematic aggression now bleeding that country is not a ""war of liberation"" - for Viet Nam is already free."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,It is a war of attempted subjugation - and it will be resisted.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"THE ATLANTIC COMMUNITY Finally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in the last year under severe tests."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"NATO has increased both the number and the readiness of its air, ground, and naval units - both its nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Even greater efforts by all its members are still required.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe, immeasurably strengthened."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The threat to the brave city of Berlin remains.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In these last 6 months the Allies have made it unmistakably clear that our presence in Berlin, our free access thereto, and the freedom of two million West Berliners would not be surrendered either to force or through appeasement - and to maintain those rights and obligations, we are prepared to talk, when appropriate, and to fight, if necessary."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Every member of NATO stands with us in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man's will to remain free.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,I cannot now predict the course of future negotiations over Berlin.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,I can only say that we are sparing no honorable effort to find a peaceful and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"I believe such a resolution can be found, and with it an improvement in our relations with the Soviet Union, if only the leaders in the Kremlin will recognize the basic rights and interests involved, and the interest of all mankind in peace."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the Atlantic Community is no longer concerned with purely military aims.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"As its common undertakings grow at an ever-increasing pace, we are, and increasingly will be, partners in aid, trade, defense, diplomacy, and monetary affairs."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new ties across the Atlantic.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in hundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, of development loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerted diplomatic positions."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanic mountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from the accumulating activity of all."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Thus, we in the free world are moving steadily toward unity and cooperation, in the teeth of that old Bolshevik prophecy, and at the very time when extraordinary rumbles of discord can be heard across the Iron Curtain."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,It is not free societies which bear within them the seeds of inevitable disunity.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS On one special problem, of great concern to our friends, and to us, I am proud to give the Congress an encouraging report."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our efforts to safeguard the dollar are progressing.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the 11 months preceding last February 1, we suffered a net loss of nearly $2 billion in gold."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the 11 months that followed, the loss was just over half a billion dollars."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And our deficit in our basic transactions with the rest of the world - trade, defense, foreign aid, and capital, excluding volatile short-term flows - has been reduced from $2 billion for 1960 to about one-third that amount for 1961."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Speculative fever against the dollar is ending - and confidence in the dollar has been restored.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We did not - and could not - achieve these gains through import restrictions, troop withdrawals, exchange controls, dollar devaluation or choking off domestic recovery."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We acted not in panic but in perspective.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the problem is not yet solved.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Persistently large deficits would endanger our economic growth and our military and defense commitments abroad.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payments.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"With the cooperation of the Congress, business, labor, and our major allies, that goal can be reached."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our shores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, to maximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aid from other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws which do not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, and to urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies so as to discourage large and disturbing capital movements."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"TRADE Above all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand our exports."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our businessmen must be export-conscious and export competitive.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants - our wage and price gains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices - our export credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continue to expand.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European Common Market.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will arise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff similar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Will we in this country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns - or will we wait until events have passed us by?
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This is the year to decide.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We need a new law - a wholly new approach - a bold new instrument of American trade policy.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course of the Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation to come."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we move decisively, our factories and farms can increase their sales to their richest, fastest-growing market."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our exports will increase.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our balance of payments position will improve.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,And we will have forged across the Atlantic a trading partnership with vast resources for freedom.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"If, on the other hand, we hang back in deference to local economic pressures, we will find ourselves cut off from our major allies."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Industries - and I believe this is most vital - industries will move their plants and jobs and capital inside the walls of the Common Market, and jobs, therefore, will be lost here in the United States if they cannot otherwise compete for its consumers."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Our farm surpluses - our balance of trade, as you all know, to Europe, the Common Market, in farm products, is nearly three or four to one in our favor, amounting to one of the best earners of dollars in our balance of payments structure, and without entrance to this Market, without the ability to enter it, our farm surpluses will pile up in the Middle West, tobacco in the South, and other commodities, which have gone through Western Europe for 15 years."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our balance of payments position will worsen.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Our consumers will lack a wider choice of goods at lower prices.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And millions of American workers - whose jobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of exports or imports, or whose jobs will be endangered by the movement of our capital to Europe, or whose jobs can be maintained only in an expanding economy - these millions of workers in your home States and mine will see their real interests sacrificed."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,Members of the Congress: The United States did not rise to greatness by waiting for others to lead.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This Nation is the world's foremost manufacturer, farmer, banker, consumer, and exporter."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The Common Market is moving ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The Communist economic offensive is under way.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The opportunity is ours - the initiative is up to us - and I believe that 1962 is the time.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"To seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new five-year Trade Expansion Action, far-reaching in scope but designed with great care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh any risks."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in the United States and in the Common Market on those items in which we together supply 80 percent of the world's trade - mostly items in which our own ability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, in these items, substantially more than we import."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This step will make it possible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts in Western Europe for access to European consumers.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,On other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50 percent - permitting bargaining by major categories - and provide for appropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjusting to import competition.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We are not neglecting the safeguards provided by peril points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Nor are we abandoning our non-European friends or our traditional ""most-favored nation"" principle."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragement for their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to our friends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market, who now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join with them in overcoming."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"Concessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not unilateral."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unless its outside tariff walls are low.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,The dangers of restriction or timidity in our own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,For together we face a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free men everywhere - to build in partnership a new trading community in which all free nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitive effort.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"These various elements in our foreign policy lead, as I have said, to a single goal - the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future - a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We will not reach that goal today, or tomorrow."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,We may not reach it in our own lifetime.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the quest is the greatest adventure of our century.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"We sometimes chafe at the burden of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"But there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"A year ago, in assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,This is our good fortune; and I welcome it now as I did a year ago.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"For it is the fate of this generation - of you in the Congress and of me as President - to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did not make."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice.
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom."
1962,Kennedy,Democratic,"And in this high endeavor, may God watch over the United States of America."

1963,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION November 27, 1963 Mr."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, my fellow Americans: All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,Today John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,No words are sad enough to express our sense of loss.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,No words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"The dream of conquering the vastness of space--the dream of partnership across the Atlantic--and across the Pacific as well--the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations--the dream of education for all of our children--the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them--the dream of care for our elderly--the dream of an all-out attack on mental illness--and above all, the dream of equal rights for all Americans, whatever their race or color--these and other American dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,And now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Under John Kennedy's leadership, this Nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace, and it has the fortitude to risk war."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We have shown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,This Nation will keep its commitments from South Viet-Nam to West Berlin.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We will be unceasing in the search for peace; resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with those with whom we differ; and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"In this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war, we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,This is the path that we shall continue to pursue.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Those who test our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength; and the just can be strong in the defense of justice.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,And let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"We will carry on the fight against poverty and misery, and disease and ignorance, in other lands and in our own."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"We will serve all the Nation, not one section or one sector, or one group, but all Americans."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,These are the United States--a united people with a united purpose.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,Our American unity does not depend upon unanimity.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"We have differences; but now, as in the past, we can derive from those differences strength, not weakness, wisdom, not despair."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Both as a people and a government, we can unite upon a program, a program which is wise and just, enlightened and constructive."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,For 32 years Capitol Hill has been my home.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"I have shared many moments of pride with you, pride in the ability of the Congress of the United States to act, to meet any crisis, to distill from our differences strong programs of national action."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,An assassin's bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the Presidency.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,I am here today to say I need your help; I cannot bear this burden alone.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"I need the help of all Americans, and all America."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"This Nation has experienced a profound shock, and in this critical moment, it is our duty, yours and mine, as the Government of the United States, to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay, and to show that we are capable of decisive action; that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness, but strength; that we can and will act and act now."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"From this chamber of representative government, let all the world know and none misunderstand that I rededicate this Government to the unswerving support of the United Nations, to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies, to the maintenance of military strength second to none, to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar, to the expansion of our foreign trade, to the reinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in Asia and Africa, and to our Alliance for Progress in this hemisphere."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"On the 20th day of January, in 1961, John F."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished ""in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"But,"" he said, ""let us begin."" Today, in this moment of new resolve, I would say to all my fellow Americans, let us continue."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"This is our challenge--not to hesitate, not to pause, not to turn about and linger over this evil moment, but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,Our most immediate tasks are here on this Hill.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"First, no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We have talked for one hundred years or more.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"It is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"I urge you again, as I did in 1957 and again in 1960, to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this Nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,There could be no greater source of strength to this Nation both at home and abroad.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"And second, no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of President Kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"This is a bill designed to increase our national income and Federal revenues, and to provide insurance against recession."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"That bill, if passed without delay, means more security for those now working, more jobs for those now without them, and more incentive for our economy."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"In short, this is no time for delay."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"It is a time for action--strong, forward-looking action on the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in America--strong, forward-looking action on youth employment opportunities; strong, forward-looking action on the pending foreign aid bill, making clear that we are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world, nor erasing Executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs--and strong, prompt, and forward-looking action on the remaining appropriation bills."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"In this new spirit of action, the Congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"And in particular, I pledge that the expenditures of your Government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,I will insist that the Government get a dollar's value for a dollar spent.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,The Government will set an example of prudence and economy.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,This does not mean that we will not meet our unfilled needs or that we will not honor our commitments.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,We will do both.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"As one who has long served in both Houses of the Congress, I firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,And I promise you that I shall always respect this.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,It is deep in the marrow of my bones.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"With equal firmness, I believe in the capacity and I believe in the ability of the Congress, despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our Nation, to act--to act wisely, to act vigorously, to act speedily when the need arises."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,The need is here.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,The need is now.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,I ask your help.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"We meet in grief, but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us meet in action, in tolerance, and in mutual understanding."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,John Kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed--that America must move forward.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,The time has come for Americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,So let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right, from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry, from those defiant of law, and those who pour venom into our Nation's bloodstream."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"I profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship, making us one people in our hour of sorrow."
1963,Johnson,Democratic,So let us here highly resolve that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not live--or die--in vain.
1963,Johnson,Democratic,"And on this Thanksgiving eve, as we gather together to ask the Lord's blessing, and give Him our thanks, let us unite in those familiar and cherished words: America, America, God shed His grace on thee, And crown thy good With brotherhood From sea to shining sea."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,PRESIDENT JOHN F.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,KENNEDY'S ANNUAL ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION I congratulate you all - not merely on your electoral victory but on your selected role in history.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,For you and I are privileged to serve the great Republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"The choices we make, for good or ill, may well shape the state of the Union for generations yet to come."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Little more than 100 weeks ago I assumed the office of President of the United States.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In seeking the help of the Congress and our countrymen, I pledged no easy answers."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I pledged - and asked - only toil and dedication.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,These the Congress and the people have given in good measure.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"And today, having witnessed in recent months a heightened respect for our national purpose and power - having seen the courageous calm of a united people in a perilous hour - and having observed a steady improvement in the opportunities and well-being of our citizens - I can report to you that the state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life, is good."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the world beyond our borders, steady progress has been made in building a world of order."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The people of West Berlin remain both free and secure.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"A settlement, though still precarious, has been reached in Laos."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The spear point of aggression has been blunted in Viet Nam.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The end of agony may be in sight in the Congo.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The doctrine of troika is dead.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"And, while danger continues, a deadly threat has been removed in Cuba."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"At home, the recession is behind us."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Well over a million more men and women are working today than were working 2 years ago.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The average factory workweek is once again more than 40 hours; our industries are turning out more goods than ever before; and more than half of the manufacturing capacity that lay silent and wasted 100 weeks ago is humming with activity.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In short, both at home and abroad, there may now be a temptation to relax."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For the road has been long, the burden heavy, and the pace consistently urgent."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But we cannot be satisfied to rest here.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This is the side of the hill, not the top."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The mere absence of war is not peace.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The mere absence of recession is not growth.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We have made a beginning - but we have only begun.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Now the time has come to make the most of our gains - to translate the renewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national purpose.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,America has enjoyed twenty-two months of uninterrupted economic recovery.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But recovery is not enough.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we are to prevail in the long run, we must expand the long-run strength of our economy."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We must move along the path to a higher rate of growth and full employment.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For this would mean tens of billions of dollars more each year in production, profits, wages, and public revenues."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It would mean an end to the persistent slack which has kept our unemployment at or above 5 percent for 61 out of the past 62 months - and an end to the growing pressures for such restrictive measures as the 35-hour week, which alone could increase hourly labor costs by as much as 14 percent, start a new wage-price spiral of inflation, and undercut our efforts to compete with other nations."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"To achieve these greater gains, one step, above all, is essential - the enactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in Federal income taxes."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For it is increasingly clear - to those in Government, business, and labor who are responsible for our economy's success - that our obsolete tax system exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and employment."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks growth instead."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,It discourages extra effort and risk.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,It distorts the use of resources.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Now, when the inflationary pressures of the war and the post-war years no longer threaten, and the dollar commands new respect - now, when no military crisis strains our resources - now is the time to act."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We cannot afford to be timid or slow.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,For this is the most urgent task confronting the Congress in 1963.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In an early message, I shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rates which will lower liabilities by $13.5 billion."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Of this, $11 billion results from reducing individual tax rates, which now range between 20 and 91 percent, to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent, with a split in the present first bracket."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Two and one-half billion dollars results from reducing corporate tax rates, from 52 percent - which gives the Government today a majority interest in profits - to the permanent pre-Korean level of 47 percent."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,This is in addition to the more than $2 billion cut in corporate tax liabilities resulting from last year's investment credit and depreciation reform.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"To achieve this reduction within the limits of a manageable budgetary deficit, I urge: first, that these cuts be phased over 3 calendar years, beginning in 1963 with a cut of some $6 billion at annual rates; second, that these reductions be coupled with selected structural changes, beginning in 1964, which will broaden the tax base, end unfair or unnecessary preferences, remove or lighten certain hardships, and in the net offset some $3.5 billion of the revenue loss; and third, that budgetary receipts at the outset be increased by $1.5 billion a year, without any change in tax liabilities, by gradually shifting the tax payments of large corporations to a more current time schedule."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This combined program, by increasing the amount of our national income, will in time result in still higher Federal revenues."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,It is a fiscally responsible program - the surest and the soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget in a balanced full employment economy.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This net reduction in tax liabilities of $10 billion will increase the purchasing power of American families and business enterprises in every tax bracket, with greatest increase going to our low-income consumers."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It will, in addition, encourage the initiative and risk-taking on which our free system depends - induce more investment, production, and capacity use - help provide the 2 million new jobs we need every year - and reinforce the American principle of additional reward for additional effort."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform is the only way to achieve these goals.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"No doubt a massive increase in Federal spending could also create jobs and growth - but, in today's setting, private consumers, employers, and investors should be given a full opportunity first."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,No doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy - but a long-run problem compels a long-run solution.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,No doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxes alone would be of great help - but corporations need customers and job seekers need jobs.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,No doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simpler and more attractive to many - but our growth is also hampered by a host of tax inequities and special preferences which have distorted the flow of investment.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"And, finally, there are no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible an equivalent cut in expenditures - but that end is not in view and to wait for it would be costly and self-defeating."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In submitting a tax program which will, of course, temporarily increase the deficit but can ultimately end it - and in recognition of the need to control expenditures - I will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrative budget which, while allowing for needed rises in defense, space, and fixed interest charges, holds total expenditures for all other purposes below this year's level."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This requires the reduction or postponement of many desirable programs, the absorption of a large part of last year's Federal pay raise through personnel and other economies, the termination of certain installations and projects, and the substitution in several programs of private for public credit."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But I am convinced that the enactment this year of tax reduction and tax reform overshadows all other domestic problems in this Congress.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For we cannot for long lead the cause of peace and freedom, if we ever cease to set the pace here at home."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,II.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Tax reduction alone, however, is not enough to strengthen our society, to provide opportunities for the four million Americans who are born every year, to improve the lives of 32 million Americans who live on the outskirts of poverty."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The quality of American life must keep pace with the quantity of American goods.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Therefore, by holding down the budgetary cost of existing programs to keep within the limitations I have set, it is both possible and imperative to adopt other new measures that we cannot afford to postpone."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"These measures are based on a series of fundamental premises, grouped under four related headings: First, we need to strengthen our Nation by investing in our youth: The future of any country which is dependent upon the will and wisdom of its citizens is damaged, and irreparably damaged, whenever any of its children is not educated to the full extent of his talent, from grade school through graduate school."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Today, an estimated 4 out of every 10 students in the 5th grade will not even finish high school - and that is a waste we cannot afford."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In addition, there is no reason why one million young Americans, out of school and out of work, should all remain unwanted and often untrained on our city streets when their energies can be put to good use."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Finally, the overseas success of our Peace Corps volunteers, most of them young men and women carrying skills and ideas to needy people, suggests the merit of a similar corps serving our own community needs: in mental hospitals, on Indian reservations, in centers for the aged or for young delinquents, in schools for the illiterate or the handicapped."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"As the idealism of our youth has served world peace, so can it serve the domestic tranquility."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Second, we need to strengthen our Nation by safeguarding its health: Our working men and women, instead of being forced to beg for help from public charity once they are old and ill, should start contributing now to their own retirement health program through the Social Security System."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Moreover, all our miracles of medical research will count for little if we cannot reverse the growing nationwide shortage of doctors, dentists, and nurses, and the widespread shortages of nursing homes and modern urban hospital facilities."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Merely to keep the present ratio of doctors and dentists from declining any further, we must over the next 10 years increase the capacity of our medical schools by 50 percent and our dental schools by 100 percent."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Finally, and of deep concern, I believe that the abandonment of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial institutions too often inflicts on them and on their families a needless cruelty which this Nation should not endure."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"The incidence of mental retardation in this country is three times as high as that of Sweden, for example - and that figure can and must be reduced."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Third, we need to strengthen our Nation by protecting the basic rights of its citizens: The right to competent counsel must be assured to every man accused of crime in Federal court, regardless of his means."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"And the most precious and powerful right in the world, the right to vote in a free American election, must not be denied to any citizen on grounds of his race or color."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"I wish that all qualified Americans permitted to vote were willing to vote, but surely in this centennial year of Emancipation all those who are willing to vote should always be permitted."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Fourth, we need to strengthen our Nation by making the best and the most economical use of its resources and facilities: Our economic health depends on healthy transportation arteries; and I believe the way to a more modern, economical choice of national transportation service is through increased competition and decreased regulation."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Local mass transit, faring even worse, is as essential a community service as hospitals and highways."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Nearly three-fourths of our citizens live in urban areas, which occupy only 2 percent of our land - and if local transit is to survive and relieve the congestion of these cities, it needs Federal stimulation and assistance."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Next, this Government is in the storage and stockpile business to the melancholy tune of more than $16 billion."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We must continue to support farm income, but we should not pile more farm surpluses on top of the $7.5 billion we already own."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We must maintain a stockpile of strategic materials, but the $8.5 billion we have acquired - for reasons both good and bad - is much more than we need; and we should be empowered to dispose of the excess in ways which will not cause market disruption."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Finally, our already overcrowded national parks and recreation areas will have twice as many visitors 10 years from now as they do today."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"If we do not plan today for the future growth of these and other great natural assets - not only parks and forests but wildlife and wilderness preserves, and water projects of all kinds - our children and their children will be poorer in every sense of the word."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,These are not domestic concerns alone.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For upon our achievement of greater vitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world: our ability to sustain and supply the security of free men and nations, our ability to command their respect for our leadership, our ability to expand our trade without threat to our balance of payments, and our ability to adjust to the changing demands of cold war competition and challenge."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We shall be judged more by what we do at home than by what we preach abroad.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Nothing we could do to help the developing countries would help them half as much as a booming U.S. economy.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,And nothing our opponents could do to encourage their own ambitions would encourage them half as much as a chronic lagging U.S. economy.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,These domestic tasks do not divert energy from our security - they provide the very foundation for freedom's survival and success.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,III.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Turning to the world outside, it was only a few years ago - in Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, even outer space - that communism sought to convey the image of a unified, confident, and expanding empire, closing in on a sluggish America and a free world in disarray."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But few people would hold to that picture today.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,In these past months we have reaffirmed the scientific and military superiority of freedom.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We have doubled our efforts in space, to assure us of being first in the future."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We have undertaken the most far-reaching defense improvements in the peacetime history of this country.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,And we have maintained the frontiers of freedom from Viet Nam to West Berlin.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But complacency or self-congratulation can imperil our security as much as the weapons of tyranny.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,A moment of pause is not a promise of peace.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Dangerous problems remain from Cuba to the South China Sea.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"The world's prognosis prescribes, in short, not a year's vacation for us, but a year of obligation and opportunity."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Four special avenues of opportunity stand out: the Atlantic Alliance, the developing nations, the new Sino-Soviet difficulties, and the search for worldwide peace."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"First, how fares the grand alliance?"
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Free Europe is entering into a new phase of its long and brilliant history.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The era of colonial expansion has passed; the era of national rivalries is fading; and a new era of interdependence and unity is taking shape.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Defying the old prophecies of Marx, consenting to what no conqueror could ever compel, the free nations of Europe are moving toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in every sphere of activity."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For 17 years this movement has had our consistent support, both political and economic."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Far from resenting the new Europe, we regard her as a welcome partner, not a rival."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For the road to world peace and freedom is still long, and there are burdens which only full partners can share - in supporting the common defense, in expanding world trade, in aligning our balance of payments, in aiding the emergent nations, in concerting political and economic policies, and in welcoming to our common effort other industrialized nations, notably Japan, whose remarkable economic and political development of the 1950's permits it now to play on the world scene a major constructive role."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"No doubt differences of opinion will continue to get more attention than agreements on action, as Europe moves from independence to more formal interdependence."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But these are honest differences among honorable associates - more real and frequent, in fact, among our Western European allies than between them and the United States."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,For the unity of freedom has never relied on uniformity of opinion.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But the basic agreement of this alliance on fundamental issues continues.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The first task of the alliance remains the common defense.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Last month Prime Minister Macmillan and I laid plans for a new stage in our long cooperative effort, one which aims to assist in the wider task of framing a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"The Nassau agreement recognizes that the security of the West is indivisible, and so must be our defense."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But it also recognizes that this is an alliance of proud and sovereign nations, and works best when we do not forget it."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It recognizes further that the nuclear defense of the West is not a matter for the present nuclear powers alone - that France will be such a power in the future - and that ways must be found without increasing the hazards of nuclear diffusion, to increase the role of our other partners in planning, manning, and directing a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate NATO alliance."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Finally, the Nassau agreement recognizes that nuclear defense is not enough, that the agreed NATO levels of conventional strength must be met, and that the alliance cannot afford to be in a position of having to answer every threat with nuclear weapons or nothing."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We remain too near the Nassau decisions, and too far from their full realization, to know their place in history."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But I believe that, for the first time, the door is open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to become a source of confidence, instead of a cause of contention."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The next most pressing concern of the alliance is our common economic goals of trade and growth.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This Nation continues to be concerned about its balance-of-payments deficit, which, despite its decline, remains a stubborn and troublesome problem."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We believe, moreover, that closer economic ties among all free nations are essential to prosperity and peace."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"And neither we nor the members of the European Common Market are so affluent that we can long afford to shelter high cost farms or factories from the winds of foreign competition, or to restrict the channels of trade with other nations of the free world."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"If the Common Market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism, it would undermine its own basic principles."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,This Government means to use the authority conferred on it last year by the Congress to encourage trade expansion on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Second, what of the developing and non-aligned nations?"
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,They were shocked by the Soviets' sudden and secret attempt to transform Cuba into a nuclear striking base - and by Communist China's arrogant invasion of India.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"They have been reassured by our prompt assistance to India, by our support through the United Nations of the Congo's unification, by our patient search for disarmament, and by the improvement in our treatment of citizens and visitors whose skins do not happen to be white."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"And as the older colonialism recedes, and the neo-colonialism of the Communist powers stands out more starkly than ever, they realize more clearly that the issue in the world struggle is not communism versus capitalism, but coercion versus free choice."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"They are beginning to realize that the longing for independence is the same the world over, whether it is the independence of West Berlin or Viet Nam."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"They are beginning to realize that such independence runs athwart all Communist ambitions but is in keeping with our own - and that our approach to their diverse needs is resilient and resourceful, while the Communists are still relying on ancient doctrines and dogmas."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Nevertheless it is hard for any nation to focus on an external or subversive threat to its independence when its energies are drained in daily combat with the forces of poverty and despair.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It makes little sense for us to assail, in speeches and resolutions, the horrors of communism, to spend $50 billion a year to prevent its military advance - and then to begrudge spending, largely on American products, less than one-tenth of that amount to help other nations strengthen their independence and cure the social chaos in which communism always has thrived."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"I am proud - and I think most Americans are proud - of a mutual defense and assistance program, evolved with bipartisan support in three administrations, which has, with all its recognized problems, contributed to the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty U.N. members to gain independence since the Second World War has succumbed to Communist control."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I am proud of a program that has helped to arm and feed and clothe millions of people who live on the front lines of freedom.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I am especially proud that this country has put forward for the 60's a vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress throughout the Americas - the Alliance for Progress.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"I do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in this mutual effort among our close neighbors, but the free states of this hemisphere, working in close collaboration, have begun to make this alliance a living reality."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Today it is feeding one out of every four school age children in Latin America an extra food ration from our farm surplus.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It has distributed 1.5 million school books and is building 17,000 classrooms."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,It has helped resettle tens of thousands of farm families on land they can call their own.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is stimulating our good neighbors to more self-help and self-reform - fiscal, social, institutional, and land reforms."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It is bringing new housing and hope, new health and dignity, to millions who were forgotten."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The men and women of this hemisphere know that the alliance cannot succeed if it is only another name for United States handouts - that it can succeed only as the Latin American nations themselves devote their best effort to fulfilling its goals.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This story is the same in Africa, in the Middle East, and in Asia."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Wherever nations are willing to help themselves, we stand ready to help them build new bulwarks of freedom."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We are not purchasing votes for the cold war; we have gone to the aid of imperiled nations, neutrals and allies alike."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"What we do ask - and all that we ask - is that our help be used to best advantage, and that their own efforts not be diverted by needless quarrels with other independent nations."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Despite all its past achievements, the continued progress of the mutual assistance program requires a persistent discontent with present performance."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We have been reorganizing this program to make it a more effective, efficient instrument - and that process will continue this year."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But free world development will still be an uphill struggle.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Government aid can only supplement the role of private investment, trade expansion, commodity stabilization, and, above all, internal self-improvement."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"The processes of growth are gradual - bearing fruit in a decade, not a day."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Our successes will be neither quick nor dramatic.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But if these programs were ever to be ended, our failures in a dozen countries would be sudden and certain."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Neither money nor technical assistance, however, can be our only weapon against poverty."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In the end, the crucial effort is one of purpose, requiring the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,And nothing carries the spirit of this American idealism more effectively to the far corners of the earth than the American Peace Corps.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"A year ago, less than 900 Peace Corps volunteers were on the job."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"A year from now they will number more than 9,000 - men and women, aged 18 to 79, willing to give 2 years of their lives to helping people in other lands."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"There are, in fact, nearly a million Americans serving their country and the cause of freedom in overseas posts, a record no other people can match."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Surely those of us who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly; by supporting our aid programs; by opening our doors to foreign visitors and diplomats and students; and by proving, day by day, by deed as well as word, that we are a just and generous people."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Third, what comfort can we take from the increasing strains and tensions within the Communist bloc?"
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Here hope must be tempered with caution.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For the Soviet-Chinese disagreement is over means, not ends."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,A dispute over how best to bury the free world is no grounds for Western rejoicing.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Nevertheless, while a strain is not a fracture, it is clear that the forces of diversity are at work inside the Communist camp, despite all the iron disciplines of regimentation and all the iron dogmatisms of ideology."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Marx is proven wrong once again: for it is the closed Communist societies, not the free and open societies which carry within themselves the seeds of internal disintegration."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The disarray of the Communist empire has been heightened by two other formidable forces.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,One is the historical force of nationalism - and the yearning of all men to be free.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,The other is the gross inefficiency of their economies.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,For a closed society is not open to ideas of progress - and a police state finds that it cannot command the grain to grow.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"New nations asked to choose between two competing systems need only compare conditions in East and West Germany, Eastern and Western Europe, North and South Viet Nam."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,They need only compare the disillusionment of Communist Cuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,And all the world knows that no successful system builds a wall to keep its people in and freedom out - and the wall of shame dividing Berlin is a symbol of Communist failure.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Finally, what can we do to move from the present pause toward enduring peace?"
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Again I would counsel caution.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I foresee no spectacular reversal in Communist methods or goals.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But if all these trends and developments can persuade the Soviet Union to walk the path of peace, then let her know that all free nations will journey with her."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But until that choice is made, and until the world can develop a reliable system of international security, the free peoples have no choice but to keep their arms nearby."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This country, therefore, continues to require the best defense in the world - a defense which is suited to the sixties."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"This means, unfortunately, a rising defense budget - for there is no substitute for adequate defense, and no ""bargain basement"" way of achieving it."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"It means the expenditure of more than $15 billion this year on nuclear weapons systems alone, a sum which is about equal to the combined defense budgets of our European Allies."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But it also means improved air and missile defenses, improved civil defense, a strengthened anti-guerrilla capacity and, of prime importance, more powerful and flexible non-nuclear forces."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For threats of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression - and a line of destroyers in a quarantine, or a division of well-equipped men on a border, may be more useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapons beyond all rational need."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But our commitment to national safety is not a commitment to expand our military establishment indefinitely.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We do not dismiss disarmament as merely an idle dream.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For we believe that, in the end, it is the only way to assure the security of all without impairing the interests of any."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,Nor do we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"While we shall never weary in the defense of freedom, neither shall we ever abandon the pursuit of peace."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In this quest, the United Nations requires our full and continued support."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Its value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in its role in the West New Guinea settlement, in its use as a forum for the Cuban crisis, and in its task of unification in the Congo."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Today the United Nations is primarily the protector of the small and the weak, and a safety valve for the strong."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law - a world in which no nation dictates the destiny of another, and in which the vast resources now devoted to destructive means will serve constructive ends."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"In short, let our adversaries choose."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"If they choose peaceful competition, they shall have it."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"If they come to realize that their ambitions cannot succeed - if they see their ""wars of liberation"" and subversion will ultimately fail - if they recognize that there is more security in accepting inspection than in permitting new nations to master the black arts of nuclear war - and if they are willing to turn their energies, as we are, to the great unfinished tasks of our own peoples - then, surely, the areas of agreement can be very wide indeed: a clear understanding about Berlin, stability in Southeast Asia, an end to nuclear testing, new checks on surprise or accidental attack, and, ultimately, general and complete disarmament."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,For we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a worldwide victory of man.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"The modern globe is too small, its weapons are too destructive, and its disorders are too contagious to permit any other kind of victory."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"To achieve this end, the United States will continue to spend a greater portion of its national production than any other people in the free world."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,For 15 years no other free nation has demanded so much of itself.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Through hot wars and cold, through recession and prosperity, through the ages of the atom and outer space, the American people have never faltered and their faith has never flagged."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"If at times our actions seem to make life difficult for others, it is only because history has made life difficult for us all."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,But difficult days need not be dark.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,I think these are proud and memorable days in the cause of peace and freedom.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We are proud, for example, of Major Rudolf Anderson who gave his life over the island of Cuba."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We salute Specialist James Allen Johnson who died on the border of South Korea.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We pay honor to Sergeant Gerald Pendell who was killed in Viet Nam.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"They are among the many who in this century, far from home, have died for our country."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"Our task now, and the task of all Americans is to live up to their commitment."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,My friends: I close on a note of hope.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,We are not lulled by the momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clearer skies above.
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We know the turbulence that lies below, and the storms that are beyond the horizon this year."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"But now the winds of change appear to be blowing more strongly than ever, in the world of communism as well as our own."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"For 175 years we have sailed with those winds at our back, and with the tides of human freedom in our favor."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"We steer our ship with hope, as Thomas Jefferson said, ""leaving Fear astern."" Today we still welcome those winds of change - and we have every reason to believe that our tide is running strong."
1963,Kennedy,Democratic,"With thanks to Almighty God for seeing us through a perilous passage, we ask His help anew in guiding the ""Good Ship Union.""

1964,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 8, 1964 Mr."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the House and Senate, my fellow Americans: I will be brief, for our time is necessarily short and our agenda is already long."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Last year's congressional session was the longest in peacetime history.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"With that foundation, let us work together to make this year's session the best in the Nation's history."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined; as the session which enacted the most far-reaching tax cut of our time; as the session which declared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States; as the session which finally recognized the health needs of all our older citizens; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation and transit policies; as the session which achieved the most effective, efficient foreign aid program ever; and as the session which helped to build more homes, more schools, more libraries, and more hospitals than any single session of Congress in the history of our Republic."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,All this and more can and must be done.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It can be done by this summer, and it can be done without any increase in spending."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"In fact, under the budget that I shall shortly submit, it can be done with an actual reduction in Federal expenditures and Federal employment."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation--to prove the success of our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"If we fail, if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless, senseless quarrels between Democrats and Republicans, or between the House and the Senate, or between the South and North, or between the Congress and the administration, then history will rightfully judge us harshly."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"But if we succeed, if we can achieve these goals by forging in this country a greater sense of union, then, and only then, can we take full satisfaction in the State of the Union."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,II.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Here in the Congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership by discharging the public business with clarity and dispatch, voting each important proposal up, or voting it down, but at least bringing it to a fair and a final vote."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy--not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"In his memory today, I especially ask all members of my own political faith, in this election year, to put your country ahead of your party, and to always debate principles; never debate personalities."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"For my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient, and honest and frugal."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,The budget to be submitted to the Congress shortly is in full accord with this pledge.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It will cut our deficit in half--from $10 billion to $4,900 million."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It will be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since 1951."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It will call for a substantial reduction in Federal employment, a feat accomplished only once before in the last 10 years."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"While maintaining the full strength of our combat defenses, it will call for the lowest number of civilian personnel in the Department of Defense since 1950."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It will call for total expenditures of $97,900 million--compared to $98,400 million for the current year, a reduction of more than $500 million."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It will call for new obligational authority of $103,800 million--a reduction of more than $4 billion below last year's request of $107,900 million."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"But it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand still."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our population is growing.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our economy is more complex.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our people's needs are expanding.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"But by closing down obsolete installations, by curtailing less urgent programs, by cutting back where cutting back seems to be wise, by insisting on a dollar's worth for a dollar spent, I am able to recommend in this reduced budget the most Federal support in history for education, for health, for retraining the unemployed, and for helping the economically and the physically handicapped."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"This budget, and this year's legislative program, are designed to help each and every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes--his hopes for a fair chance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a full-time job on full-time pay; his hopes for a decent home for his family in a decent community; his hopes for a good school for his children with good teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or unemployment or old age."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,III.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope--some because of their poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many because of both."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me in that effort.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,The richest Nation on earth can afford to win it.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We cannot afford to lose it.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"One thousand dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return $40,000 or more in his lifetime."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Poverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization and support."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at the State and the local level and must be supported and directed by State and local efforts."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,For the war against poverty will not be won here in Washington.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It must be won in the field, in every private home, in every public office, from the courthouse to the White House."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,The program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to help that one-fifth of all American families with incomes too small to even meet their basic needs.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Our chief weapons in a more pinpointed attack will be better schools, and better health, and better homes, and better training, and better job opportunities to help more Americans, especially young Americans, escape from squalor and misery and unemployment rolls where other citizens help to carry them."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Very often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of poverty, but the symptom."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"The cause may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow citizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities, in a lack of education and training, in a lack of medical care and housing, in a lack of decent communities in which to live and bring up their children."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"But whatever the cause, our joint Federal-local effort must pursue poverty, pursue it wherever it exists--in city slums and small towns, in sharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps, on Indian Reservations, among whites as well as Negroes, among the young as well as the aged, in the boom towns and in the depressed areas."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"No single piece of legislation, however, is going to suffice."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed areas of Appalachia.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless, aimless, hopeless youngsters to work on useful projects."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We must distribute more food to the needy through a broader food stamp program.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We must create a National Service Corps to help the economically handicapped of our own country as the Peace Corps now helps those abroad.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high-level commission on automation.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"If we have the brain power to invent these machines, we have the brain power to make certain that they are a boon and not a bane to humanity."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2 million workers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must, by including special school aid funds as part of our education program, improve the quality of teaching, training, and counseling in our hardest hit areas."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must build more libraries in every area and more hospitals and nursing homes under the Hill-Burton Act, and train more nurses to staff them."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must provide hospital insurance for our older citizens financed by every worker and his employer under Social Security, contributing no more than $1 a month during the employee's working career to protect him in his old age in a dignified manner without cost to the Treasury, against the devastating hardship of prolonged or repeated illness."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give more help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for our poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free enterprise system a decent home for every American family."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We must help obtain more modern mass transit within our communities as well as low-cost transportation between them.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Above all, we must release $11 billion of tax reduction into the private spending stream to create new jobs and new markets in every area of this land."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,IV.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,These programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Every American will benefit by the extension of social security to cover the hospital costs of their aged parents.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Every American community will benefit from the construction or modernization of schools, libraries, hospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of more nurses and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,And every individual American taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the earliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new investment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,That tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Now we need action.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,The new budget clearly allows it.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our taxpayers surely deserve it.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our economy strongly demands it.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"And every month of delay dilutes its benefits in 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for employment."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"For until the bill is signed, its investment incentives cannot be deemed certain, and the withholding rate cannot be reduced--and the most damaging and devastating thing you can do to any businessman in America is to keep him in doubt and to keep him guessing on what our tax policy is."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,And I say that we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15 percent our withholding rate.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"I therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the first of February, if at all possible."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"For however proud we may be of the unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last 3 years, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"In 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70 million job mark, but we will soon need more than 75 million jobs."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,In 1963 our gross national product reached the $600 billion level--$100 billion higher than when we took office.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,But it easily could and it should be still $30 billion higher today than it is.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Wages and profits and family income are also at their highest levels in history--but I would remind you that 4 million workers and 13 percent of our industrial capacity are still idle today.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We need a tax cut now to keep this country moving.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,V.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,For our goal is not merely to spread the work.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Our goal is to create more jobs.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe the enactment of a 35-hour week would sharply increase costs, would invite inflation, would impair our ability to compete, and merely share instead of creating employment."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,But I am equally opposed to the 45- or 50-hour week in those industries where consistently excessive use of overtime causes increased unemployment.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"So, therefore, I recommend legislation authorizing the creation of a tripartite industry committee to determine on an industry-by-industry basis as to where a higher penalty rate for overtime would increase job openings without unduly increasing costs, and authorizing the establishment of such higher rates."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,VI.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Let me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear: All of these increased opportunities--in employment, in education, in housing, and in every field--must be open to Americans of every color."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"As far as the writ of Federal law will run, we must abolish not some, but all racial discrimination."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"For this is not merely an economic issue, or a social, political, or international issue."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"It is a moral issue, and it must be met by the passage this session of the bill now pending in the House."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,All members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to the public.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,All members of the public should be equally eligible for Federal benefits that are financed by the public.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,All members of the public should have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their children to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the public good.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Today, Americans of all races stand side by side in Berlin and in Viet Nam."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,They died side by side in Korea.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,Surely they can work and eat and travel side by side in their own country.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,VII.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those who seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed skills and those joining their families."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"In establishing preferences, a nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: ""What can you do for our country?"" But we should not be asking: ""In what country were you born?"" VIII."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"For our ultimate goal is a world without war, a world made safe for diversity, in which all men, goods, and ideas can freely move across every border and every boundary."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different ways, not as partisans, but as patriots."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"First, wc must maintain--and our reduced defense budget will maintain--that margin of military safety and superiority obtained through 3 years of steadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic, our conventional, and our antiguerilla forces."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"In 1964 we will be better prepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom, whether it is threatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those in Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and men across international borders to foment insurrection."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,And we must continue to use that strength as John Kennedy used it in the Cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty--to demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of lasting peace.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Second, we must take new steps--and we shall make new proposals at Geneva--toward the control and the eventual abolition of arms."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Even in the absence of agreement, we must not stockpile arms beyond our needs or seek an excess of military power that could be provocative as well as wasteful."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,It is in this spirit that in this fiscal year we are cutting back our production of enriched uranium by 25 percent.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We are shutting down four plutonium piles.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We are closing many nonessential military installations.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,And it is in this spirit that we today call on our adversaries to do the same.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Third, we must make increased use of our food as an instrument of peace--making it available by sale or trade or loan or donation-to hungry people in all nations which tell us of their needs and accept proper conditions of distribution."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Fourth, we must assure our pre-eminence in the peaceful exploration of outer space, focusing on an expedition to the moon in this decade--in cooperation with other powers if possible, alone if necessary."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Fifth, we must expand world trade."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Having recognized in the Act of 1962 that we must buy as well as sell, we now expect our trading partners to recognize that we must sell as well as buy."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We are willing to give them competitive access to our market, asking only that they do the same for us."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Sixth, we must continue, through such measures as the interest equalization tax, as well as the cooperation of other nations, our recent progress toward balancing our international accounts."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,This administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the dollar.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Seventh, we must become better neighbors with the free states of the Americas, working with the councils of the OAS, with a stronger Alliance for Progress, and with all the men and women of this hemisphere who really believe in liberty and justice for all."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Eighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to develop their independence and raise their standard of living, and thereby frustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"To do this, the rich must help the poor--and we must do our part."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must achieve a more rigorous administration of our development assistance, with larger roles for private investors, for other industrialized nations, and for international agencies and for the recipient nations themselves."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Ninth, we must strengthen our Atlantic and Pacific partnerships, maintain our alliances and make the United Nations a more effective instrument for national independence and international order."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Tenth, and finally, we must develop with our allies new means of bridging the gap between the East and the West, facing danger boldly wherever danger exists, but being equally bold in our search for new agreements which can enlarge the hopes of all, while violating the interests of none."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"In short, I would say to the Congress that we must be constantly prepared for the worst, and constantly acting for the best."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We must be strong enough to win any war, and we must be wise enough to prevent one."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,We shall neither act as aggressors nor tolerate acts of aggression.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We intend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"We can fight, if we must, as we have fought before, but we pray that we will never have to fight again."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,IX.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"My good friends and my fellow Americans: In these last 7 sorrowful weeks, we have learned anew that nothing is so enduring as faith, and nothing is so degrading as hate."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"John Kennedy was a victim of hate, but he was also a great builder of faith--faith in our fellow Americans, whatever their creed or their color or their station in life; faith in the future of man, whatever his divisions and differences."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,This faith was echoed in all parts of the world.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,On every continent and in every land to which Mrs.
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"Johnson and I traveled, we found faith and hope and love toward this land of America and toward our people."
1964,Johnson,Democratic,"So I ask you now in the Congress and in the country to join with me in expressing and fulfilling that faith in working for a nation, a nation that is free from want and a world that is free from hate--a world of peace and justice, and freedom and abundance, for our time and for all time to come."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 4, 1965 Mr."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the Congress, my fellow Americans: On this Hill which was my home, I am stirred by old friendships."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Though total agreement between the Executive and the Congress is impossible, total respect is important."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I am proud to be among my colleagues of the Congress whose legacy to their trust is their loyalty to their Nation.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new Members of this body tonight.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Twenty-eight years ago, I felt as you do now."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"You will soon learn that you are among men whose first love is their country, men who try each day to do as best they can what they believe is right."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We are entering the third century of the pursuit of American union.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Two hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined together to demand freedom from arbitrary power."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"One hundred years ago, in 1865, following a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact of union was finally sealed."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many groups which make up the American community.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,That struggle has often brought pain and violence.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It is not yet over.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But we have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in the history of freedom.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And so tonight, now, in 1965, we begin a new quest for union."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek the unity of man with the world that he has built--with the knowledge that can save or destroy him--with the cities which can stimulate or stifle him--with the wealth and the machines which can enrich or menace his spirit.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow each of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate the quality of our civilization.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This is the search that we begin tonight.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,STATE OF THE WORLD But the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in isolation.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"For today the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon the state of the world."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Our concern and interest, compassion and vigilance, extend to every corner of a dwindling planet."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet, it is not merely our concern but the concern of all free men."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We will not, and we should not, assume that it is the task of Americans alone to settle all the conflicts of a torn and troubled world."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Let the foes of freedom take no comfort from this.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"For in concert with other nations, we shall help men defend their freedom."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our first aim remains the safety and the well-being of our own country.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We are prepared to live as good neighbors with all, but we cannot be indifferent to acts designed to injure our interests, or our citizens, or our establishments abroad."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The community of nations requires mutual respect.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We shall extend it--and we shall expect it.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In our relations with the world we shall follow the example of Andrew Jackson who said: ""I intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong."" And he promised, that ""the honor of my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the statement of truth or for the performance of duty."" That was this Nation's policy in the 1830's and that is this Nation's policy in the 1960's."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the American dream.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide desert of disappointed dreams.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our Nation was created to help strike away the chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they keep man less than God means him to be.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We are moving toward that destiny, never more rapidly than we have moved in the last 4 years."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In this period we have built a military power strong enough to meet any threat and destroy any adversary.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And that superiority will continue to grow so long as this office is mine--and you sit on Capitol Hill.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In this period no new nation has become Communist, and the unity of the Communist empire has begun to crumble."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our neighbors of the hemisphere, and joined in an Alliance for Progress toward economic growth and political democracy."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In this period we have taken more steps toward peace--including the test ban treaty--than at any time since the cold war began.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In this period we have relentlessly pursued our advances toward the conquest of space.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Most important of all, in this period, the United States has reemerged into the fullness of its self-confidence and purpose."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,No longer are we called upon to get America moving.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We are moving.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,No longer do we doubt our strength or resolution.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We are strong and we have proven our resolve.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,No longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We know that history is ours to make.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And if there is great danger, there is now also the excitement of great expectations."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,AMERICA AND THE COMMUNIST NATIONS Yet we still live in a troubled and perilous world.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no longer a single threat.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There are many.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,They differ in intensity and in danger.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,They require different attitudes and different answers.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,With the Soviet Union we seek peaceful understandings that can lessen the danger to freedom.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Last fall I asked the American people to choose that course.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will carry forward their command.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"If we are to live together in peace, we must come to know each other better."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I am sure that the American people would welcome a chance to listen to the Soviet leaders on our television--as I would like the Soviet people to hear our leaders on theirs.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I hope the new Soviet leaders can visit America so they can learn about our country at firsthand.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their identity.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Your Government, assisted by the leaders in American labor and business, is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these countries and with the Soviet Union."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will report our conclusions to the Congress.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In Asia, communism wears a more aggressive face."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We see that in Viet-Nam.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Why are we there?
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We are there, first, because a friendly nation has asked us for help against the Communist aggression."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Ten years ago our President pledged our help.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Three Presidents have supported that pledge.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We will not break it now.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Second, our own security is tied to the peace of Asia."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Twice in one generation we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,To ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our goal is peace in southeast Asia.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,That will come only when aggressors leave their neighbors in peace.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,What is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will never be found wanting.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,THE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD But communism is not the only source of trouble and unrest.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There are older and deeper sources--in the misery of nations and in man's irrepressible ambition for liberty and a better life.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,With the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt--and my country has always felt--very special ties of interest and affection.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It will be the purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Together we share and shape the destiny of the new world.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In the coming year I hope to pay a visit to Latin America.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And I will steadily enlarge our commitment to the Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and injustice in this hemisphere.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In the Atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 years--a Europe that is growing in strength, unity, and cooperation with America."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,A great unfinished task is the reunification of Germany through self-determination.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This European policy is not based on any abstract design.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It is based on the realities of common interests and common values, common dangers and common expectations."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"These realities will continue to have their way--especially, I think, in our expanding trade and especially in our common defense."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Free Americans have shaped the policies of the United States.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And because we know these realities, those policies have been, and will be, in the interest of Europe."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Free Europeans must shape the course of Europe.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And, for the same reasons, that course has been, and will be, in our interest and in the interest of freedom."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the last year.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe this year.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In Africa and Asia we are witnessing the turbulent unfolding of new nations and continents.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We welcome them to the society of nations.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own independence, and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to the welfare of all of their people."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We seek not fidelity to an iron faith, but a diversity of belief as varied as man himself."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek not to extend the power of America but the progress of humanity.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek not to dominate others but to strengthen the freedom of all people.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will seek new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the growing scarcity in world resources.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Finally, we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the effectiveness of the United Nations."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The frustrations of the United Nations are a product of the world that we live in, and not of the institution which gives them voice."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It is far better to throw these differences open to the assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,These are some of the goals of the American Nation in the world in which we live.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"For ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame, neither gratitude nor obedience."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek peace.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek freedom.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek to enrich the life of man.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that we mean for all men to ultimately have.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,TOWARD THE GREAT SOCIETY World affairs will continue to call upon our energy and our courage.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But today we can turn increased attention to the character of American life.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We are in the midst of the greatest upward surge of economic well-being in the history of any nation.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our flourishing progress has been marked by price stability that is unequalled in the world.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our balance of payments deficit has declined and the soundness of our dollar is unquestioned.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I pledge to keep it that way and I urge business and labor to cooperate to that end.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We worked for two centuries to climb this peak of prosperity.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But we are only at the beginning of the road to the Great Society.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Ahead now is a summit where freedom from the wants of the body can help fulfill the needs of the spirit.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We built this Nation to serve its people.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We want to grow and build and create, but we want progress to be the servant and not the master of man."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We do not intend to live in the midst of abundance, isolated from neighbors and nature, confined by blighted cities and bleak suburbs, stunted by a poverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The Great Society asks not how much, but how good; not only how to create wealth but how to use it; not only how fast we are going, but where we are headed."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It proposes as the first test for a nation: the quality of its people.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swelling riches and surging power.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It will not be the gift of government or the creation of presidents.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It will require of every American, for many generations, both faith in the destination and the fortitude to make the journey."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And like freedom itself, it will always be challenge and not fulfillment."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And tonight we accept that challenge.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,A NATIONAL AGENDA I propose that we begin a program in education to ensure every American child the fullest development of his mind and skills.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing diseases.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a better and a more stimulating place to live.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we increase the beauty of America and end the poisoning of our rivers and the air that we breathe.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country that are now suffering from distress and depression.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we make new efforts to control and prevent crime and delinquency.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and the opportunity to vote.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the creations of art.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I propose that we make an all-out campaign against waste and inefficiency.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"THE TASK Our basic task is threefold: First, to keep our economy growing; --to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most Americans; --and to improve the quality of life for all."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In the next 6 weeks I will submit special messages with detailed proposals for national action in each of these areas.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight I would like just briefly to explain some of my major recommendations in the three main areas of national need.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,IV.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"A GROWING ECONOMY BASIC POLICIES First, we must keep our Nation prosperous."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek full employment opportunity for every American citizen.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will present a budget designed to move the economy forward.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,More money will be left in the hands of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We will continue along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I confidently predict--what every economic sign tells us tonight--the continued flourishing of the American economy.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact of a recession.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The knowledge that our Government will, and can, move swiftly will strengthen the confidence of investors and business."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Congress can reinforce this confidence by insuring that its procedures permit rapid action on temporary income tax cuts.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And special funds for job-creating public programs should be made available for immediate use if recession threatens.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our continued prosperity demands continued price stability.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Business, labor, and the consumer all have a high stake in keeping wages and prices within the framework of the guideposts that have already served the Nation so well."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Finding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of American business.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But we stand ready--with credit and other help--to assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire Nation.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,ON THE FARMS Our economy owes much to the efficiency of our farmers.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We must continue to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I have instructed the Secretary of Agriculture to lead a major effort to find new approaches to reduce the heavy cost of our farm programs and to direct more of our effort to the small farmer who needs the help the most.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"INCREASED PROSPERITY We can help insure continued prosperity through: --a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken areas left behind by our national progress; --further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern technology, for the laboring-man is an indispensable force in the American system; --the extension of the minimum wage to more than 2 million unprotected workers; --the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation system."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms, I will propose to Congress changes in the Taft-Hartley Act including section 14(b)."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will do so hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided Americans in various States of our Union.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to continued growth.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,TRANSPORTATION FOR GROWTH I will recommend heavier reliance on competition in transportation and a new policy for our merchant marine.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will ask for funds to study high-speed rail transportation between urban centers.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We will begin with test projects between Washington and Boston.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"On high-speed trains, passengers could travel this distance in less than 4 hours."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,II.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL Second, we must open opportunity to all our people."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Most Americans enjoy a good life.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But far too many are still trapped in poverty and idleness and fear.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Let a just nation throw open to them the city of promise: --to the elderly, by providing hospital care under social security and by raising benefit payments to those struggling to maintain the dignity of their later years; --to the poor and the unfortunate, through doubling the war against poverty this year; --to Negro Americans, through enforcement of the civil rights law and elimination of barriers to the right to vote; --to those in other lands that are seeking the promise of America, through an immigration law based on the work a man can do and not where he was born or how he spells his name."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,III.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,TO ENRICH THE LIFE OF ALL Our third goal is to improve the quality of American life.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,THROUGH EDUCATION We begin with learning.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Every child must have the best education that this Nation can provide.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Thomas Jefferson said that no nation can be both ignorant and free.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Today no nation can be both ignorant and great.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In addition to our existing programs, I will recommend a new program for schools and students with a first year authorization of $1,500 million."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It will help at every stage along the road to learning.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the excitement of learning.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For the primary and secondary school years we will aid public schools serving low-income families and assist students in both public and private schools.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For the college years we will provide scholarships to high school students of the greatest promise and the greatest need and we will guarantee low-interest loans to students continuing their college studies.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,New laboratories and centers will help our schools--help them lift their standards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,These centers will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve special treatment.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,THROUGH BETTER HEALTH Greatness requires not only an educated people but a healthy people.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Our goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of our people.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We already carry on a large program in this country. for research and health.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In addition, regional medical centers can provide the most advanced diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other major diseases."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,New support for medical and dental education will provide the trained people to apply our knowledge.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Community centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for school-age children from poor families, including services for the mentally retarded."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,THROUGH IMPROVING THE WORLD WE LIVE IN The City An educated and healthy people require surroundings in harmony with their hopes.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In our urban areas the central problem today is to protect and restore man's satisfaction in belonging to a community where he can find security and significance.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The first step is to break old patterns--to begin to think and work and plan for the development of the entire metropolitan areas.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We will take this step with new programs of help for the basic community facilities and for neighborhood centers of health and recreation.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,New and existing programs will be open to those cities which work together to develop unified long-range policies for metropolitan areas.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We must also make some very important changes in our housing programs if we are to pursue these same basic goals.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,So a Department of Housing and Urban Development will be needed to spearhead this effort in our cities.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Every citizen has the right to feel secure in his home and on the streets of his community.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"To help control crime, we will recommend programs: --to train local law enforcement officers; --to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal; --to discover the causes of crime and better ways to prevent it."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I will soon assemble a panel of outstanding experts of this Nation to search out answers to the national problem of crime and delinquency, and I welcome the recommendations and the constructive efforts of the Congress."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The Beauty of America For over three centuries the beauty of America has sustained our spirit and has enlarged our vision.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We must act now to protect this heritage.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In a fruitful new partnership with the States and the cities the next decade should be a conservation milestone.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We must make a massive effort to save the countryside and to establish--as a green legacy for tomorrow--more large and small parks, more seashores and open spaces than have been created during any other period in our national history."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"A new and substantial effort must be made to landscape highways to provide places of relaxation and recreation wherever our roads run, Within our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and to transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water before it happens.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We will step up our effort to control harmful wastes, giving first priority to the cleanup of our most contaminated rivers."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We will increase research to learn much more about the control of pollution.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We hope to make the Potomac a model of beauty here in the Capital, and preserve unspoiled stretches of some of our waterways with a Wild Rivers bill."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,More ideas for a beautiful America will emerge from a White House Conference on Natural Beauty which I will soon call.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Art and Science We must also recognize and encourage those who can be pathfinders for the Nation's imagination and understanding.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"To help promote and honor creative achievements, I will propose a National Foundation on the Arts."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"To develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress, I will recommend programs to encourage basic science, particularly in the universities--and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our growing need for fresh water."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,IV.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"THE GOVERNMENT For government to serve these goals it must be modern in structure, efficient in action, and ready for any emergency."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I am busy, currently, reviewing the structure of the entire executive branch of this Government."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to meet more effectively the tasks of the 20th century.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Wherever waste is found, I will eliminate it."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Last year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the National Government."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And I intend to do better this year.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies that your Government plans to make.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Even the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will propose laws to insure the necessary continuity of leadership should the President become disabled or die.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In addition, I will propose reforms in the electoral college--leaving undisturbed the vote by States--but making sure that no elector can substitute his will for that of the people."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Last year, in a sad moment, I came here and I spoke to you after 33 years of public service, practically all of them here on this Hill."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This year I speak after 1 year as President of the United States.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Many of you in this Chamber are among my oldest friends.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We have shared many happy moments and many hours of work, and we have watched many Presidents together."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet, only in the White House can you finally know the full weight of this Office."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The greatest burden is not running the huge operations of government--or meeting daily troubles, large and small--or even working with the Congress."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"A President's hardest task is not to do what is right, but to know what is right."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Yet the Presidency brings no special gift of prophecy or foresight.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"You take an oath, you step into an office, and you must then help guide a great democracy."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It was once barren land.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The angular hills were covered with scrub cedar and a few large live oaks.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Little would grow in that harsh caliche soil of my country.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And each spring the Pedernales River would flood our valley.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But men came and they worked and they endured and they built.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And tonight that country is abundant; abundant with fruit and cattle and goats and sheep, and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are gone."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Why did men come to that once forbidding land?
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Well, they were restless, of course, and they had to be moving on."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But there was more than that.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"There was a dream--a dream of a place where a free man could build for himself, and raise his children to a better life--a dream of a continent to be conquered, a world to be won, a nation to be made."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Remembering this, I knew the answer."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,A President does not shape a new and personal vision of America.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,He collects it from the scattered hopes of the American past.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It existed when the first settlers saw the coast of a new world, and when the first pioneers moved westward."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It has guided us every step of the way.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It sustains every President.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But it is also your inheritance and it belongs equally to all the people that we all serve.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs; as I have tried, in part, to do tonight."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It shall lead us as we enter the third century of the search for ""a more perfect union."" This, then, is the state of the Union: Free and restless, growing and full of hope."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,So it was in the beginning.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"So it shall always be, while God is willing, and we are strong enough to keep the faith."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"SPECIAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS: THE AMERICAN PROMISE March 15, 1965 Mr."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the Congress: I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,So it was at Lexington and Concord.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,So it was a century ago at Appomattox.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"So it was last week in Selma, Alabama."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Many were brutally assaulted.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"One good man, a man of God, was killed."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great Government--the Government of the greatest Nation on earth.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues; issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved Nation."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"For with a country as with a person, ""What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?"" There is no Negro problem."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no Southern problem.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no Northern problem.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is only an American problem.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And we are met here tonight as Americans--not as Democrats or Republicans-we are met here as Americans to solve that problem.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South: ""All men are created equal""--""government by consent of the governed""--""give me liberty or give me death."" Well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"This dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot be found in his power, or in his position."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It says that he shall share in freedom, he shall choose his leaders, educate his children, and provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"To apply any other test--to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race, his religion or the place of his birth--is not only to do injustice, it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"THE RIGHT TO VOTE Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The history of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But about this there can and should be no argument.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of State law."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,No law that we now have on the books-and I have helped to put three of them there--can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In such a case our duty must be clear to all of us.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We must now act in obedience to that oath.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO VOTE Wednesday I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders tomorrow.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"After they have reviewed it, it will come here formally as a bill."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and to visit with my former colleagues."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I have had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which I will submit to the clerks tonight.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But I want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation, This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections--Federal, State, and local--which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"This bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the United States Government if the State officials refuse to register them.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Finally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress--I have no doubt that I will get some--on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the Constitution.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"To those who seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities; who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections, the answer is simple: Open your polling places to all your people."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,THE NEED FOR ACTION There is no constitutional issue here.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The command of the Constitution is plain.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no moral issue.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It is wrong--deadly wrong--to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is no issue of States rights or national rights.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is only the struggle for human rights.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in Federal elections.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,That civil rights bill was passed after 8 long months of debate.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another 8 months before we get a bill.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We have already waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"So I ask you to join me in working long hours--nights and weekends, if necessary--to pass this bill."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And I don't make that request lightly.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"For from the window where I sit with the problems of our country I recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations, and the harsh judgment of history on our acts."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"WE SHALL OVERCOME But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Their cause must be our cause too.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And we shall overcome.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil I know how agonizing racial feelings are.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But a century has passed, more than a hundred years, since the Negro was freed."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And he is not fully free tonight.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln, a great President of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"A century has passed, more than a hundred years, since equality was promised."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And yet the Negro is not equal.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,A century has passed since the day of promise.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And the promise is unkept.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The time of justice has now come.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For Negroes are not the only victims.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"How many white children have gone uneducated, how many white families have lived in stark poverty, how many white lives have been scarred by fear, because we have wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror?"
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"So I say to all of you here, and to all in the Nation tonight, that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"This great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all: black and white, North and South, sharecropper and city dweller."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"They are the enemies and not our fellow man, not our neighbor."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And these enemies too, poverty, disease and ignorance, we shall overcome."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"AN AMERICAN PROBLEM Now let none of us in any sections look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section, or on the problems of our neighbors."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There is really no part of America where the promise of equality has been fully kept.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In Buffalo as well as in Birmingham, in Philadelphia as well as in Selma, Americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This is one Nation.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,What happens in Selma or in Cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every American.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities, and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"As we meet here in this peaceful, historic chamber tonight, men from the South, some of whom were at Iwo Jima, men from the North who have carried Old Glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it, men from the East and from the West, are all fighting together without regard to religion, or color, or region, in Viet-Nam."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Men from every region fought for us across the world 20 years ago.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the South made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great Republic--and in some instances, a great many of them, more."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Golden Gate to the harbors along the Atlantic, will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all Americans."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For all of us owe this duty; and I believe that all of us will respond to it.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Your President makes that request of every American.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,PROGRESS THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"His actions and protests, his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life, have awakened the conscience of this Nation."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"His demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice, designed to provoke change, designed to stir reform."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,He has called upon us to make good the promise of America.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in American democracy."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep-seated belief in the democratic process.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but upon the force of moral right; not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,There have been many pressures upon your President and there will be others as the days come and go.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought: in the courts, and in the Congress, and in the hearts of men."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But the right of free speech does not carry with it, as has been said, the right to holler fire in a crowded theater."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We must preserve the right to free assembly, but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We do have a right to protest, and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And I intend to protect all those rights as long as I am permitted to serve in this office.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We will guard against violence, knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek--progress, obedience to law, and belief in American values."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,In Selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek order.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,We seek unity.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But we will not accept the peace of stifled rights, or the order imposed by fear, or the unity that stifles protest."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,For peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"In Selma tonight, as in every--and we had a good day there--as in every city, we are working for just and peaceful settlement."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We must all remember that after this speech I am making tonight, after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone, and after you have promptly passed this bill, the people of Selma and the other cities of the Nation must still live and work together."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And when the attention of the Nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"This cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence, as the history of the South itself shows."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days--last Tuesday, again today, RIGHTS MUST BE OPPORTUNITIES The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But, in a larger sense, most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Because all Americans just must have the right to vote.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And we are going to give them that right.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It requires a trained mind and a healthy body.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"It requires a decent home, and the chance to find a job, and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Of course, people cannot contribute to the Nation if they are never taught to read or write, if their bodies are stunted from hunger, if their sickness goes untended, if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,So we want to open the gates to opportunity.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But we are also going to give all our people, black and white, the help that they need to walk through those gates."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"THE PURPOSE OF THIS GOVERNMENT My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla, Tex., in a small Mexican-American school."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Few of them could speak English, and I couldn't speak much Spanish."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast, hungry."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,They knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,They never seemed to know why people disliked them.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But they knew it was so, because I saw it in their eyes."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I often walked home late in the afternoon, after the classes were finished, wishing there was more that I could do."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But all I knew was to teach them the little that I knew, hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I never thought then, in 1928, that I would be standing here in 1965."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But now I do have that chance--and I'll let you in on a secret--I mean to use it.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,And I hope that you will use it with me.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,This is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,The might of past empires is little compared to ours.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"But I do not want to be the President who built empires, or sought grandeur, or extended dominion."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"And so at the request of your beloved Speaker and the Senator from Montana; the majority leader, the Senator from Illinois; the minority leader, Mr."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"McCulloch, and other Members of both parties, I came here tonight--not as President Roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill, not as President Truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill--but I came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"I want this to be the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, which did all these things for all these people."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Beyond this great chamber, out yonder in 50 States, are the people that we serve."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,Who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"We all can guess, from our own lives, how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness, how many problems each little family has."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,They look most of all to themselves for their futures.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But I think that they also look to each of us.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,"Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says--in Latin--""God has favored our undertaking."" God will not favor everything that we do."
1965,Johnson,Democratic,It is rather our duty to divine His will.
1965,Johnson,Democratic,But I cannot help believing that He truly understands and that He really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 12, 1966 Mr."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the House and the Senate, my fellow Americans: I come before you tonight to report on the State of the Union for the third time."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I come here to thank you and to add my tribute, once more, to the Nation's gratitude for this, the 89th Congress."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This Congress has already reserved for itself an honored chapter in the history of America.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Our Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Later on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It just must be the center of our concerns.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,But we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory over the desires and the intentions of all the American people.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"This Nation is mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong enough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a Great Society here at home."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full vigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law last year."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on poverty.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid program, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and ignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to help those nations that are trying to control population growth."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United States and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before attempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in America."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our rivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire large river basins."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by building up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal system from prevention to probation.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and State jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct public and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing discrimination in the sale and rental of housing."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the Federal Government by creating a new Cabinet level Department of Transportation and reorganizing several existing agencies.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In turn, I will restructure our civil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be assigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both required as well as rewarded."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I will ask you to make it possible for Members of the House of Representatives to work more effectively in the service of the Nation through a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to 4 years, concurrent with that of the President."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,II.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Because of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would like to do."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will make sure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop the Great Society.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Last year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it will soar again this year to a total over $720 billion."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Because our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve every program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be one of the lowest in many years."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It will be only $1.8 billion next year.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Total spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8 billion.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Revenues next year will be $111 billion.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,On a cash basis--which is the way that you and I keep our family budget--the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"That is to say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and all the money that your Government will spend, your Government next year will collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year 1967."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle pleasures.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of the richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies of life to all of your fellow Americans."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,There are men who cry out: We must sacrifice.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Well, let us rather ask them: Who will they sacrifice?"
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek the learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell in squalor now brightened by the hope of home?"
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our poor?"
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Time may require further sacrifices.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And if it does, then we will make them."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,But we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"But if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the name of justice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands of those that are most in need."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifled and alone in their hope tonight.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Hundreds of their servants and their protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,III.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The Great Society leads us along three roads--growth and justice and liberation. [1.] First is growth--the national prosperity which supports the well-being of our people and which provides the tools of our progress.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already--in every city and countryside.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This Nation is flourishing.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Workers are making more money than ever--with after-tax income in the past 5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,More people are working than ever before in our history--an increase last year of 2 1/2 million jobs.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Corporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For the past 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year alone they had a rise of 20 percent."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Average farm income is higher than ever.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Over the past 5 years it is up 40 percent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the Treasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of payments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3 billion, or less, in 1965."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This achievement has been made possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with your Government.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance of payments deficit altogether in the next year.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the savings of every family in this land.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"It is essential, to prevent inflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint, and I do so again tonight."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reductions made effective only 12 days ago."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Without raising taxes--or even increasing the total tax bill paid--we should move to improve our withholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go, speed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary simplifications of the tax structure at an early date."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I hope these measures will be adequate.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"But if the necessities of Vietnam require it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional appropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed. [2.] The second road is justice."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Justice means a man's hope should not be limited by the color of his skin.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for nondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts--and to give the Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try those who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or others exercising their constitutional rights--and to increase penalties to a level equal to the nature of the crime."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Legislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the Federal Government, to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For that other nation within a Nation--the poor--whose distress has now captured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to continue, but to speed up the war on poverty."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And in so doing, we will provide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of experience."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"To improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new Community Development Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps teams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and available medical resources."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand minimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the laws of the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without improperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively to deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest. [3.] The third path is the path of liberation."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It is to use our success for the fulfillment of our lives.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,A great nation is one which breeds a great people.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"A great people flower not from wealth and power, but from a society which spurs them to the fullness of their genius."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,That alone is a Great Society.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that shared prosperity is not enough."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In the midst of abundance modern man walks oppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and which individual abundance alone will not overcome."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We can subdue and we can master these forces--bring increased meaning to our lives--if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change old ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear enough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last year, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our Armed Forces."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs already passed by the Senate--the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home rule for the District of Columbia."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Working together, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the growth of entire metropolitan areas.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Of all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really more shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and construct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire river systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"To attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must have a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police forces."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Our people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their streets--and that right just must be secured.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highways.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting tragedy.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We must also act to prevent the deception of the American consumer--requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their contents--all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed--and keeping harmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We must change to master change.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch, to modernize the relations between city and State and Nation."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,A new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our transportation activities.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"The present structure--35 Government agencies, spending $5 billion yearly--makes it almost impossible to serve either the growing demands of this great Nation or the needs of the industry, or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of sound--in excess of 2,000 miles per hour."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I propose to examine our Federal system--the relation between city, State, Nation, and the citizens themselves."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We need a commission of the most distinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I will ask them to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful diversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to fulfill the dreams of the American people.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"As the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without being obligated to a few large contributors."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Therefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contributions--to prohibit the endless proliferation of committees, bringing local and State committees under the act--to attach strong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of contributions--and to broaden the participation of the people, through added tax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the candidate of their choice."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,To strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide a 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives--which should not begin before 1972.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert enormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning--depriving this Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Today, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early years, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical tasks of legislating."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And a longer term will serve to attract more men of the highest quality to political life.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"The Nation, the principle of democracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better served by a 4-year term for Members of the House."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And I urge your swift action.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,IV.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"That conflict is not an isolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have followed with strong consistency since World War II."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States--the welfare and the freedom of the people of the United States.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,But nations sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could bring decay and even disaster."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,An America that is mighty beyond description--yet living in a hostile or despairing--world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,In this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We gave our aid to Greece and Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,In this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We have extended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the largest program of economic assistance in the world.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,In this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression--in Korea under President Truman--in the Formosa Straits under President Eisenhower--in Cuba under President Kennedy--and again in Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Tonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world problems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I will discuss them fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing lines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents. [1.] The first principle is strength."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight I can tell you that we are strong enough to keep all of our commitments.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will need expenditures of $58.3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"While special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated to increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures put together in the entire Federal budget will rise this coming year by only $.6 billion."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious economy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the other departments of Government. [2.] A second principle of policy is the effort to control, and to reduce, and to ultimately eliminate the modern engines of destruction."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will vigorously pursue existing proposals--and seek new ones--to control arms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. [3.] A third major principle of our foreign policy is to help build those associations of nations which reflect the opportunities and the necessities of the modern world.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"By strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by meeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing world."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for Progress, the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the regional organizations of developing continents, and that supreme association--the United Nations."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to trade, and to improve international finance. [4.] A fourth enduring strand of policy has been to help improve the life of man."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"From the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested on the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people advancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign assistance to help those countries who will help themselves.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease and ignorance.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great America, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries committed to develop a modern agriculture."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give children in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give our own children."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,To advance these ends I will propose the International Education Act of 1966.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research--and we will earmark funds to help their efforts."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1 billion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us in this work in the world. [5.] The fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy is support of national independence--the right of each people to govern themselves--and to shape their own institutions."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,For a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks the way that it has chosen to walk for itself.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few--or the oppression of one race by another."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And I will ask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions which are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of today's world in which we live.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,In Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those who would subdue others to their ideas or their will.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,In recent months a number of nations have cast out those who would subject them to the ambitions of mainland China.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,History is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped from the genius of each people.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,History does not favor a single system or belief--unless force is used to make it so.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"That is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of our policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba--and tonight in Vietnam."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young Americans die in a distant land."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Tonight, as so many nights before, the American Nation is asked to sacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the love of its freedom."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"How many times--in my lifetime and in yours--have the American people gathered, as they do now, to hear their President tell them of conflict and tell them of danger?"
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Each time they have answered.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,They have answered with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this Nation required.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And they do again tonight in Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Not too many years ago Vietnam was a peaceful, if troubled, land."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,In the North was an independent Communist government.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the friendly help of the United States."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,There were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on their own people.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,But their progress was slight.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Their hope of success was dim.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to South in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in aggression."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"As the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We could leave, abandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we could stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We stayed.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And we will stay until aggression has stopped.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its enemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's solemn pledge--a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three American Presidents.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose independence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and in America's protection."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that confidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet the appetite of aggression."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We would have to fight in one land, and then we would have to fight in another--or abandon much of Asia to the domination of Communists."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Last year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Swiftly increasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join forces that were already in the South.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Attack and terror increased, spurred and encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the will to continue and that their victory was near."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Despite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold back the mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the South, and to make our firmness clear to the North."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Thus. we began limited air action against military targets in North Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We increased our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 men."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,These moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its success.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of Americans and their allies--and by the enduring courage of the South Vietnamese who, I can tell you, have lost eight men last year for every one of ours."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The enemy is no longer close to victory.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Time is no longer on his side.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,There is no cause to doubt the American commitment.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Our decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam, with friends and adversaries throughout the world."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Since Christmas your Government has labored again, with imagination and endurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,For 20 days now we and our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Able and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more than 40 countries."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all 113 that we have relations with, and some that we don't."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We have talked to the United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and to friends, in Rome and Warsaw, in Paris and Tokyo, in Africa and throughout this hemisphere, America has made her position abundantly clear."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military alliance in Vietnam."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We fight for the principle of self-determination--that the people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course, choose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without fear."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This is all we want for South Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It is all the people of South Vietnam want.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires less than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We have also made it clear--from Hanoi to New York--that there are no arbitrary limits to our search for peace.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We stand by the Geneva Agreements of 1954 and 1962.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any proposals--four points or fourteen or forty--and we will consider the views of any group."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will work for a cease-fire now or once discussions have begun.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will withdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right to shape its own future."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We have said all this, and we have asked--and hoped--and we have waited for a response."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,So far we have received no response to prove either success or failure.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we share this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to our own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We have found understanding and support.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And we know they wait with us tonight for some response that could lead to peace.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future may require."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard conference, or even both at once."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Until peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,We will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South Vietnam.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither increased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"But we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and every dollar, and every decision--whatever the cost or whatever the challenge."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those that are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry forward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain terrors of war."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"And let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months may become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to battle."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"There may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far that war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"But for others it must now be clear--the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies between peace and the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"The people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared needs of man, the needs for food and shelter and education--the chance to build and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of battle--the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent peace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"It is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will, and so many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"To all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight: Let us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond that, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the servant of life."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"In this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,V.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,This is the State of the Union.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"But over it all--wealth, and promise, and expectation--lies our troubling awareness of American men at war tonight."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,How many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other wars?
1966,Johnson,Democratic,How very many are not here to listen?
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The war in Vietnam is not like these other wars.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet, finally, war is always the same."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,It is trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Therefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this world."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,But there is a difference.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire, against all the most inward pulls of my desire."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"For we have children to teach, and we have sick to be cured, and we have men to be freed."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"There are poor to be lifted up, and there are cities to be built, and there is a world to be helped."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,Yet we do what we must.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,I believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,And from that belief your President summons his strength for the trials that lie ahead in the days to come.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,The work must be our work now.
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with whatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth."
1966,Johnson,Democratic,"Thank you, and goodnight."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 10, 1967 Mr."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Vice President, distinguished Members of the Congress: I share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body, the distinguished Representative from Rhode Island, Mr."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Fogarty.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing for our Nation.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"At home, the question is whether we will continue working for better opportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living better than any people in history."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Abroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly remote."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"So our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the dangers to us are obvious and close at hand, but, rather, whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distant--and some think that it is safe to lay down our burdens."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I have come tonight to ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that issue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad--to continue to build a better America--and to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"As President Abraham Lincoln said, ""We must ask where we are, and whither we are tending."" I."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better country.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have struck down legal barriers to equality.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year alone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Three and one-half million Americans have already received treatment under Medicare since July.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more Americans on the payrolls in the last year alone.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum wage.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1 million Americans.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in the neighborhoods of the poor.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have set out to rebuild our cities on a scale that has never been attempted before.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We have begun to rescue our waters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside, our cities and our towns."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the Neighborhood Youth Corps--or through Head Start, a chance to learn."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So together we have tried to meet the needs of our people.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And, we have succeeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Now we must answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress, or whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been--abandoned now by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe that our people do not want to quit--though the task is great, the work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or months, but of years--and sometimes it may be even decades."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,II.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward the progress of these last 3 years.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"These five ways concern programs, partnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"First, programs."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We must see to it, I think, that these new programs that we have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible way."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Three years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social progress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This required trial and error--and it has produced both.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"But as we learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we are trying to improve our tactics."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"In the long run, these starts--some rewarding, others inadequate and disappointing--are crucial to success."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,One example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate among us.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"On a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American President, Harry S."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Truman, declare this: ""The American people have decided that poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease."" Many listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few understood what was required and did anything about it."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The executive branch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action on that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President presented."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me in a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, ""It will not be a short or easy struggle--no single weapon...will suffice--but we shall not rest until that war is won."" And I have come here to renew that pledge tonight."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the Congress--as well as some that we have learned from our own trial and error.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of thousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big cities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young, little children."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must command our full determination.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"For learning brings skills; and skills bring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, as well as taxes."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This war--like the war in Vietnam--is not a simple one.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,There is no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The enemy is not easy to perceive, or to isolate, or to destroy."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,There are mistakes and there are setbacks.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"But we are moving, and our direction is forward."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into them.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Administrative skills and trained manpower are just as vital to their success as dollars.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And I believe those skills will come.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,But it will take time and patience and hard work.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Success cannot be forced at a single stroke.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success is to come--as we know it must.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We have done much in the space of 2 short years, working together."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different reorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this Government, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department--a Department of Business and Labor.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"By combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and other related agencies, I think we can create a more economical, efficient, and streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Every program will be thoroughly evaluated Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and simplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our Governors.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Where there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Where there has been progress, we will try to build upon it."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Our second objective is partnership--to create an effective partnership at all levels of government.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And I should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The 88th and the 89th Congresses passed more social and economic legislation than any two single Congresses in American history.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Most of you who were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those measures.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,But your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Federal energy is essential.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,But it is not enough.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Only a total working partnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization, each private institution, and each responsible citizen."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Each State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government in today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and as I see you are examining yours."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Some will need to reorganize and reshape their methods of administration--as we are doing.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Others will need to revise their constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date--as we are doing.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the multitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more efficiently."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,During the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments about $40 billion in grants-in-aid.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"This year alone, 70 percent of our Federal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the State and local governments."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"With Federal assistance, State and local governments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"These enormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We intend to work closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that we have established within the resources that are available."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I wish, of course, that we could do all that should be done--and that we could do it now."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,But the Nation has many commitments and responsibilities which make heavy demands upon our total resources.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,No administration would more eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than the administration that started them.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"So let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we have--knowing that it is far, far more than we have ever done before, and far, far less than our problems will ultimately require."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Let us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans who need special help.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years old, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the early years."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest years, before it is too late to correct."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their Nation's progress."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20 percent.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security payments in the first year.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I will recommend that each of the 23 million Americans now receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percent--from $44 to $70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for those with a total of 25 years of coverage."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We must raise the limits that retired workers can earn without losing social security income.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to the forgotten in our midst--the American Indians and the migratory farm workers.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning of justice for all of our fellow Americans.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the landmark Model Cities program.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I intend to seek for this effort, this year, the full amount that you in Congress authorized last year."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great cities.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should vastly expand the fight for clean air with a total attack on pollution at its sources, and--because air, like water, does not respect manmade boundaries--we should set up ""regional airsheds"" throughout this great land."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for a beautiful America--to clean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our cities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and more open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that come after us to enjoy."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen--before a jury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should find a solution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color, has a decent home of his choice."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should modernize our Selective Service System.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The National Commission on Selective Service will shortly submit its report.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I will send you new recommendations to meet our military manpower needs.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,But let us resolve that this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as effective as possible.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should protect what Justice Brandeis called the ""right most valued by civilized men""--the right to privacy."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should outlaw all wiretapping--public and private--wherever and whenever it occurs, except when the security of this Nation itself is at stake--and only then with the strictest governmental safeguards."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional powers to outlaw electronic ""bugging"" and ""snooping."" I hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed where average citizens can understand it.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should immediately take steps to prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against hazardous household products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry natural gas across our Nation."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000 permanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform and financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating lobbying, and by restoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move their residences."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our classrooms."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We should insist that the public interest be fully served through the public's airwaves.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Now we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our minds--on yours and mine.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the Law Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We appointed the National Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the best ways to carry that attack forward.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its preliminary recommendations we are ready to move."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This is not a war that Washington alone can win.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The idea of a national police force is repugnant to the American people.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Crime must be rooted out in local communities by local authorities.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our policemen must be better trained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the local citizens that they try to serve and to protect."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The National Government can and expects to help.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"It will enable us to assist those States and cities that try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces better, their corrections systems more effective, and their courts more efficient."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"When the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost: --90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master plans, to combat crime in their area; --60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant communications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest equipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on crime; --50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police academy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best trained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We will also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from becoming adult delinquents.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We will seek new partnerships with States and cities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And we will recommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"At the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free America--as Abraham Lincoln once said--must ""let reverence for the laws . . . become the political religion of the Nation."" Our country's laws must be respected."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Order must be maintained.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And I will support--with all the constitutional powers the President possesses--our Nation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our communities.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Many of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have already been laid.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Some will necessarily be small at first, but ""every beginning is a consequence."" If we postpone this urgent work now, it will simply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead, moving ahead steadily and safely."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Last year, in 1966: --Wages were the highest in history--and the unemployment rate, announced yesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years; --Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent; --Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent; --Our gross national product advanced 5.5 percent, to about $740 billion; --Income per farm went up 6 percent."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Now we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.5 percent over the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This was more than we had expected--and the Government tried to do everything that we knew how to do to hold it down.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Yet we were not as successful as we wished to be.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"In the 18 months after we entered World War II, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 13.5 percent."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"In the first 18 months after Korea, after the conflict broke out there, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 11 percent."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,During those two periods we had OPA price control that the Congress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Since Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to avoid imposing them.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We believe that we have done better, but we make no pretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Our greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive rise in interest rates and the tightening of credit.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"They imposed very severe and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders, and all those associated with the home industry."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Last January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and moderate tax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Legislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the economy.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"With these measures, in both instances, the Congress approved most of the recommendations rather promptly."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"As 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Wholesale prices are lower tonight than they were in August.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So are retail food prices.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Monetary conditions are also easing.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Most interest rates have retreated from their earlier peaks.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,More money now seems to be available.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly seek, I am confident that this movement can continue."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I pledge the American people that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest rates and to ease money in this country.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The Federal Home Loan Bank Board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to savings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals; that will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the progress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and toward lower interest rates."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxes--to last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual expenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I will promptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these expenditures permits it.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This surcharge will raise revenues by some $4.5 billion in the first year.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"For example, a person whose tax payment, the tax he owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an extra $60 over the 12-month period, or $5 a month."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The overwhelming majority of Americans who pay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $5 a month.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Married couples with two children, with incomes up to $5,000 per year, will be exempt from this tax--as will single people with an income of up to $1,900 a year."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Now if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect when I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual taxes would have been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"So this proposal is that while we have this problem and this emergency in Vietnam, while we are trying to meet the needs of our people at home, your Government asks for slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give our country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of trial."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"For fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.7 billion and revenues of $117 billion."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,That will leave us a deficit this year of $9.7 billion.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"For fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And with the tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate revenues will be $126.9 billion."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The deficit then will be $8.1 billion.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Yours is the responsibility to discuss and to debate them--to approve or modify or reject them.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a colleague and as Vice President and President."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I should like to say to the Members of the opposition--whose numbers, if I am not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhat--that the genius of the American political system has always been best expressed through creative debate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Throughout our history, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to understand this."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So let there be light and reason in our relations.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,That is the way to a responsible session and a responsive government.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the quality of life for every American--not just the rich, not just the poor, but every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We all go to school--to good schools or bad schools.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We all take air into our lungs--clean air or polluted air.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We all drink water--pure water or polluted water.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We all face sickness someday, and some more often than we wish, and old age as well."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We all have a stake in this Great Society--in its economic growth, in reduction of civil strife--a great stake in good government."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this country in these years.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our children's children will pay the price if we are not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand up and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,III.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Abroad, as at home, there is also risk in change."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"But abroad, as at home, there is a greater risk in standing still."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,No part of our foreign policy is so sacred that it ever remains beyond review.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We shall be flexible where conditions in the world change--and where man's efforts can change them for the better.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We are in the midst of a great transition--a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"In Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly to give our hemispheric policies new direction."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American effort in economic and social development was launched by the conference at Bogota in 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The Alliance for Progress moved dramatically forward under President Kennedy.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"There is new confidence that the voice of the people is being heard; that the dignity of the individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere, and we are facing up to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,In this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happen--because it has happened.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"So together, I think, we must now move to strike down the barriers to full cooperation among the American nations, and to free the energies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our citizens."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Africa stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"It has yet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above all, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"There, too, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa cooperate on a regional basis."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,More and more our programs for Africa are going to be directed toward self-help.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those who are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races, and to help those who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"In the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately, has not yet taken hold."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,An already tortured peace seems to be constantly threatened.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities of improved relations among the nations of that region.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We are working hard at that task.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,In the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the earth's population.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Over the years we--and others--have invested very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and Pakistan.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,It must strengthen their capacity to help themselves.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"It must help these two nations--both our friends--to overcome poverty, to emerge as self-reliant leaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,In Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common defense.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"But we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved through measures of arms control and disarmament, and through other forms of practical agreement."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs, in economic and technical cooperation, in trade negotiations, in political consultation, and in working together with the governments and peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve when we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild Europe.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We faced new challenges and opportunities then and there--and we faced also some dangers.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"But I believe that the peoples on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both sides of this Chamber, wanted to face them together."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Our relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in transition.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"When we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for that matter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and without venom."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses of outer space.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial credits to Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to Romania and Yugoslavia."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another 2 years.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to embassies.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have started discussions with international agencies on ways of increasing contacts with Eastern European countries.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to fulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world that were entered into before I became President.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by approving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile capabilities.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile defense.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against us or against our allies.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and the United States is in our common interest, in arms control and in disarmament."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us, if that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons and defenses."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I thought we were making some progress in that direction the first few months I was in office.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I realize that any additional race would impose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an additional waste of resources with no gain in security to either side."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the Congress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing directly upon this problem.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Next to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human family is the race between food supply and population increase."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,That race tonight is being lost.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The time for rhetoric has clearly passed.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The time for concerted action is here and we must get on with the job.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed: First, the developing nations must give highest priority to food production, including the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Second, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into voluntary family planning programs."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Every member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,IV.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I come now finally to Southeast Asia--and to Vietnam in particular.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Soon I will submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight I want to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies are committed by the SEATO Treaty to ""act to meet the common danger"" of aggression in Southeast Asia."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the United States, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically violated by the Communists."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"That violation threatens the independence of all the small nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to remain non-Communist--if that is what they choose--as North Vietnam has to remain Communist.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all necessary measures to prevent further aggression.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"No better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by the great Thomas Jefferson: ""It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater."" We have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to prevent a larger war--a war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the Communists succeed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by aggression and by force."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe, and I am supported by some authority, that if they are not checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them later."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"That is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that is why it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,You will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Is there anyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was not changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Sixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression--this time it was in Korea.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had failed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The Asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as we said 16 years ago in Korea: ""This far and no further."" I think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a stubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to settle political questions."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This I cannot do.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We face more cost, more loss, and more agony."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,For the end is not yet.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I cannot promise you that it will come this year--or come next year.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting longer than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to stand up and resist."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our men in that area--there are nearly 500,000 now--have borne well ""the burden and the heat of the day."" Their efforts have deprived the Communist enemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We have steadily frustrated his main forces.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,General Westmoreland reports that the enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,So I must say to you that our pressure must be sustained--and will be sustained--until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more than he can ever gain.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of ""accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resource""--of ""laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade."" That, and patience--and I mean a great deal of patience."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Our South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Because they must provide real security to the people living in the countryside.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"It means bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they can respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in, and that they can have a personal stake in."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We hope that government is now beginning to emerge.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"While I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the very distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that South Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We can help, but only they can win this part of the war."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Their task is to build and protect a new life in each rural province.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,One result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,It is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence is not going to be slammed shut.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,They know that it is possible for them to choose their own national destinies--without coercion.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The performance of our men in Vietnam--backed by the American people--has created a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of Asia and the Pacific.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent in their homes and in their countries.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Fear of external Communist conquest in many Asian nations is already subsiding--and with this, the spirit of hope is rising."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"For the first time in history, a common outlook and common institutions are already emerging."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,This forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of Asian nations themselves.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"It was precisely this movement that we hoped to accelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965, and I pledged ""a much more massive effort to improve the life of man"" in that part of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we were spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Twenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of the billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the Congress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are already open."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new directions.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Their hopes are high.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Their faith is strong.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Their confidence is deep.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"And even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying forward this constructive historic development."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"As recommended by the Eugene Black mission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a special authorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian regional programs."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We are eager to turn our resources to peace.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Our efforts in behalf of humanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary line.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask the Congress for funds to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam--and their deserving neighbors who wish our help."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of Mainland China and the world community--including working together in all the tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate of the Chinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her neighbors' rights.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We would be the first to applaud her were she to apply her great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for security and friendly relations with her neighboring countries.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Our hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that we, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam through to an honorable peace."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and others, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional discussions of peace--anywhere, any time."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Until such efforts succeed, or until the infiltration ceases, or until the conflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is that we just must firmly pursue our present course."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We will stand firm in Vietnam.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,I think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest burden of all.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,With their lives they serve their Nation.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,We must give them nothing less than our full support--and we have given them that--nothing less than the determination that Americans have always given their fighting men.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is small compared to their own."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,How long it will take I cannot prophesy.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"I only know that the will of the American people, I think, is tonight being tested."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Whether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time, and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to ""get it over with"" is inviting but dangerous; whether we can accept the necessity of choosing ""a great evil in order to ward off a greater""; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the passions that are ordinarily loosed in time of war--on all these questions so much turns."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"The answers will determine not only where we are, but ""whither we are tending."" A time of testing--yes."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And a time of transition.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,The transition is sometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and often quite dangerous.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"But we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"We know that ""man is born unto trouble."" We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many men."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"For all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations that concern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve, for all the issues we must face with the agony that attends them, let us remember that ""those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigues of supporting it."" But let us also count not only our burdens but our blessings--for they are many."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,And let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"Let us draw encouragement from the signs of hope--for they, too, are many."
1967,Johnson,Democratic,Let us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been found wanting.
1967,Johnson,Democratic,"So with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your support, we are going to persist--and we are going to succeed."

1968,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 17, 1968 Mr."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the Congress, and my fellow Americans: I was thinking as I was walking down the aisle tonight of what Sam Rayburn told me many years ago: The Congress always extends a very warm welcome to the President--as he comes in."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Thank all of you very, very much."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I have come once again to this Chamber--the home of our democracy--to give you, as the Constitution requires, ""Information of the State of the Union."" I report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad: --that it is our will that is being tried, not our strength; our sense of purpose, not our ability to achieve a better America; --that we have the strength to meet our every challenge; the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home; and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"And I report to you that I believe, with abiding conviction, that this people--nurtured by their deep faith, tutored by their hard lessons, moved by their high aspirations--have the will to meet the trials that these times impose."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Since I reported to you last January: --Three elections have been held in Vietnam--in the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence. --A President, a Vice President, a House and Senate, and village officials have been chosen by popular, contested ballot. --The enemy has been defeated in battle after battle. --The number of South Vietnamese living in areas under Government protection tonight has grown by more than a million since January of last year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,These are all marks of progress.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet: --The enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into battle,despite his continuous heavy losses. --He continues to hope that America's will to persevere can be broken."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Well--he is wrong.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,America will persevere.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Our patience and our perseverance will match our power.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Aggression will never prevail.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But our goal is peace--and peace at the earliest possible moment.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Right now we are exploring the meaning of Hanoi's recent statement.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,There is no mystery about the questions which must be answered before the bombing is stopped.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We believe that any talks should follow the San Antonio formula that I stated last September, which said: --The bombing would stop immediately if talks would take place promptly and with reasonable hopes that they would be productive. --And the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This Nation simply cannot accept anything less without jeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,If a basis for peace talks can be established on the San Antonio foundations--and it is my hope and my prayer that they can--we would consult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostilities--a really true cease-fire--could be made the first order of business.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I will report at the earliest possible moment the results of these explorations to the American people.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I have just recently returned from a very fruitful visit and talks with His Holiness the Pope and I share his hope--as he expressed it earlier today--that both sides will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end to the war in Vietnam.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I have today assured him that we and our allies will do our full part to bring this about.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Since I spoke to you last January, other events have occurred that have major consequences for world peace. --The Kennedy Round achieved the greatest reduction in tariff barriers in all the history of trade negotiations. --The nations of Latin America at Punta del Este resolved to move toward economic integration. --In Asia, the nations from Korea and Japan to Indonesia and Singapore worked behind America's shield to strengthen their economies and to broaden their political cooperation. --In Africa, from which the distinguished Vice President has just returned, he reports to me that there is a spirit of regional cooperation that is beginning to take hold in very practical ways."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,These events we all welcomed.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet since I last reported to you, we and the world have been confronted by a number of crises: --During the Arab-Israeli war last June, the hot line between Washington and Moscow was used for the first time in our history."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,A cease-fire was achieved without a major power confrontation.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Now the nations of the Middle East have the opportunity to cooperate with Ambassador Jarring's U.N. mission and they have the responsibility to find the terms of living together in stable peace and dignity, and we shall do all in our power to help them achieve that result. --Not far from this scene of conflict, a crisis flared on Cyprus involving two peoples who are America's friends: Greece and Turkey."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Our very able representative, Mr."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Cyrus Vance, and others helped to ease this tension. --Turmoil continues on the mainland of China after a year of violent disruption."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The radical extremism of their Government has isolated the Chinese people behind their own borders.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"The United States, however, remains willing to permit the travel of journalists to both our countries; to undertake cultural and educational exchanges; and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop materials."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Since I spoke to you last, the United States and the Soviet Union have taken several important steps toward the goal of international cooperation."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"As you will remember, I met with Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro and we achieved if not accord, at least a clearer understanding of our respective positions after 2 days of meeting."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrowed, we have worked with the Soviet Union and with other nations to reach an agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapons."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"On the basis of communications from Ambassador Fisher in Geneva this afternoon, I am encouraged to believe that a draft treaty can be laid before the conference in Geneva in the very near future."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I hope to be able to present that treaty to the Senate this year for the Senate's approval.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We achieved, in 1967, a consular treaty with the Soviets, the first commercial air agreement between the two countries, and a treaty banning weapons in outer space."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We shall sign, and submit to the Senate shortly, a new treaty with the Soviets and with others for the protection of astronauts."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Serious differences still remain between us, yet in these relations, we have made some progress since Vienna, the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban missile crisis."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"But despite this progress, we must maintain a military force that is capable of deterring any threat to this Nation's security, whatever the mode of aggression."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Our choices must not be confined to total war--or to total acquiescence.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We have such a military force today.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We shall maintain it.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I wish--with all of my heart--that the expenditures that are necessary to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs of peace.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"But until world conditions permit, and until peace is assured, America's might--and America's bravest sons who wear our Nation's uniform--must continue to stand guard for all of us--as they gallantly do tonight in Vietnam and other places in the world."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Yet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the conditions of peace.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,For two decades America has committed itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threatens the peace.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We shall sustain that commitment.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"This year I shall propose: --That we launch, with other nations, an exploration of the ocean depths to tap its wealth, and its energy, and its abundance. --That we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the International Development Association, and to increase the resources of the Asian Development Bank. --That we adopt a prudent aid program, rooted in the principle of self-help. --That we renew and extend the food for freedom program."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Our food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of famine.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"But unless the rapid growth of population in developing countries is slowed, the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Governments in the developing countries must take such facts into consideration.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We in the United States are prepared to help assist them in those efforts.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But we must also improve the lives of children already born in the villages and towns and cities on this earth.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,They can be taught by great teachers through space communications and the miracle of satellite television--and we are going to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Let me speak now about some matters here at home.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight our Nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever been accomplished before.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Americans are prosperous as men have never been in recorded history.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Yet there is in the land a certain restlessness--a questioning.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The total of our Nation's annual production is now above $800 billion.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,For 83 months this Nation has been on a steady upward trend of growth.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"All about them, most American families can see the evidence of growing abundance: higher paychecks, humming factories, new cars moving down new highways."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"More and more families own their own homes, equipped with more than 70 million television sets."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,A new college is founded every week.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Today more than half of the high school graduates go on to college.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,There are hundreds of thousands of fathers and mothers who never completed grammar school--who will see their children graduate from college.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Why, then, this restlessness?"
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Because when a great ship cuts through the sea, the waters are always stirred and troubled."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And our ship is moving.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,It is moving through troubled and new waters; it is moving toward new and better shores.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We ask now, not how can we achieve abundance?--but how shall we use our abundance?"
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Not, is there abundance enough for all?--but, how can all share in our abundance?"
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"While we have accomplished much, much remains for us to meet and much remains for us to master. --In some areas, the jobless rate is still three or four times the national average. --Violence has shown its face in some of our cities. --Crime increases on our streets. --Income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers; and parity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hope--not an achievement. --New housing construction is far less than we need--to assure decent shelter for every family. --Hospital and medical costs are high, and they are rising. --Many rivers--and the air in many cities--remain badly polluted."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And our citizens suffer from breathing that air.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We have lived with conditions like these for many, many years."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"But much that we once accepted as inevitable, we now find absolutely intolerable."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"In our cities last summer, we saw how wide is the gulf for some Americans between the promise and the reality of our society."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We know that we cannot change all of this in a day.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,It represents the bitter consequences of more than three centuries.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But the issue is not whether we can change this; the issue is whether we will change this.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Well, I know we can."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And I believe we will.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This then is the work we should do in the months that are ahead of us in this Congress.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"The first essential is more jobs, useful jobs for tens of thousands who can become productive and can pay their own way."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Our economy has created 7 1/2 million new jobs in the past 4 years.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,It is adding more than a million and a half new jobs this year.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Through programs passed by the Congress, job training is being given tonight to more than a million Americans in this country."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"This year, the time has come when we must get to those who are last in line--the hard-core unemployed--the hardest to reach."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Employment officials estimate that 500,000 of these persons are now unemployed in the major cities of America."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Our objective is to place these 500,000 in private industry jobs within the next 3 years."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"To do this, I propose a $2.1 billion manpower program in the coming fiscal year--a 25 percent increase over the current year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Most of this increase will be used to start a new partnership between government and private industry to train and to hire the hard-core unemployed persons.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I know of no task before us of more importance to us, to the country, or to our future."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Another essential is to rebuild our cities.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Last year the Congress authorized $662 million for the Model Cities program.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I requested the full amount of that authorization to help meet the crisis in the cities of America.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But the Congress appropriated only $312 million--less than half.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This year I urge the Congress to honor my request for model cities funds to rebuild the centers of American cities by granting us the full amount that you in the Congress authorized--$1 billion.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The next essential is more housing--and more housing now.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the reach of its families.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Therefore we must call together the resources of industry and labor, to start building 300,000 housing units for low- and middle-income families next year--that is three times more than this year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We must make it possible for thousands of families to become homeowners, not rent-payers."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I propose, for the consideration of this Congress, a 10-year campaign to build 6 million new housing units for low- and middle-income families."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Six million units in the next 10 years.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We have built 530,000 the last 10 years."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Better health for our children--all of our children--is essential if we are to have a better America.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Last year, Medicare, Medicaid, and other new programs that you passed in the Congress brought better health to more than 25 million Americans."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,American medicine--with the very strong support and cooperation of public resources-has produced a phenomenal decline in the death rate from many of the dread diseases.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"But it is a shocking fact that, in saving the lives of babies, America ranks 15th among the nations of the world."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"And among children, crippling defects are often discovered too late for any corrective action."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"This is a tragedy that Americans can, and Americans should, prevent."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I shall, therefore, propose to the Congress a child health program to provide, over the next 5 years, for families unable to afford it--access to health services from prenatal care of the mother through the child's first year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,When we do that you will find it is the best investment we ever made because we will get these diseases in their infancy and we will find a cure in a great many instances that we can never find by overcrowding our hospitals when they are grown.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Now when we act to advance the consumer's cause I think we help every American.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Last year, with very little fanfare the Congress and the executive branch moved in that field."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We enacted the Wholesome Meat Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Product Safety Commission, and a law to improve clinical laboratories."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"And now, I think, the time has come to complete our unfinished work."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"The Senate has already passed the truth-in-lending bill, the fire safety bill, and the pipeline safety laws."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight I plead with the House to immediately act upon these measures and I hope take favorable action upon all of them.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I call upon the Congress to enact, without delay, the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection laws that I submitted to the Congress last year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the House to guard against fraud and manipulation in the Nation's commodity exchange market.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"These measures are a pledge to our people--to keep them safe in their homes and at work, and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And I think we must do more.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I propose: --New powers for the Federal Trade Commission to stop those who defraud and who swindle our public. --New safeguards to insure the quality of fish and poultry, and the safety of our community water supplies. --A major study of automobile insurance. --Protection against hazardous radiation from television sets and other electronic equipment."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"And to give the consumer a stronger voice, I plan to appoint a consumer counsel in the Justice Department--a lawyer for the American consumer--to work directly under the Attorney General, to serve the President's Special Assistant for Consumer Affairs, and to serve the consumers of this land."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This Congress--Democrats and Republicans--can earn the thanks of history.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We can make this truly a new day for the American consumer, and by giving him this protection we can live in history as the consumer-conscious Congress."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,So let us get on with the work.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Let us act soon.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We, at every level of the government, State, local, Federal, know that the American people have had enough of rising crime and lawlessness in this country."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,They recognize that law enforcement is first the duty of local police and local government.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"They recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime is in the home, the church, the city hall and the county courthouse and the statehouse--not in the far-removed National Capital of Washington."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But the people also recognize that the National Government can and the National Government should help the cities and the States in their war on crime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional authority.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And this we shall do.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This does not mean a national police force.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"It does mean help and financial support: --to develop State and local master plans to combat crime, --to provide better training and better pay for police, and --to bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city and every county in America."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,There is no more urgent business before this Congress than to pass the Safe Streets Act this year that I proposed last year.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,That law will provide these required funds.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,They are so critically needed that I have doubled my request under this act to $100 million in fiscal 1969.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"And I urge the Congress to stop the trade in mail-order murder, to stop it this year by adopting a proper gun control law."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"This year, I will propose a Drug Control Act to provide stricter penalties for those who traffic in LSD and other dangerous drugs with our people."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug laws by increasing the number of Federal drug and narcotics control officials by more than 30 percent.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the young.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I also request you to give us funds to add immediately 100 assistant United States attorneys throughout the land to help prosecute our criminal laws.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We have increased our judiciary by 40 percent and we have increased our prosecutors by 16 percent.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The dockets are full of cases because we don't have assistant district attorneys to go before the Federal judge and handle them.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We start these young lawyers at $8,200 a year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And the docket is clogged because we don't have authority to hire more of them.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I ask the Congress for authority to hire 100 more.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"These young men will give special attention to this drug abuse, too."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Finally, I ask you to add 100 FBI agents to strengthen law enforcement in the Nation and to protect the individual rights of every citizen."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,A moment ago I spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where the fires of disorder burned last summer.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We can--and in time we will--change that despair into confidence, and change those frustrations into achievements."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But violence will never bring progress.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We can make progress only by attacking the causes of violence and only where there is civil order founded on justice.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Today we are helping local officials improve their capacity to deal promptly with disorders.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that local authorities are able to resist them swiftly, to resist them sternly, and to resist them decisively."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I shall recommend other actions: --To raise the farmers' income by establishing a security commodity reserve that will protect the market from price-depressing stocks and protect the consumer from food scarcity. --I shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively for fair prices. --I shall recommend programs for new air safety measures. --Measures to stem the rising costs of medical care. --Legislation to encourage our returning veterans to devote themselves to careers in community service such as teaching, and being firemen, and joining our police force, and our law enforcement officials. --I shall recommend programs to strengthen and finance our anti-pollution efforts. --Fully funding all of the $2.18 billion poverty program that you in the Congress had just authorized in order to bring opportunity to those who have been left far behind. --I shall recommend an Educational Opportunity Act to speed up our drive to break down the financial barriers that are separating our young people from college."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I shall also urge the Congress to act on several other vital pending bills--especially the civil rights measures--fair jury trials, protection of Federal rights, enforcement of equal employment opportunity, and fair housing."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"The unfinished work of the first session must be completed--the Higher Education Act, the Juvenile Delinquency Act, conservation measures to save the redwoods of California, and to preserve the wonders of our scenic rivers, the Highway Beautification Act--and all the other measures for a cleaner, and for a better, and for a more beautiful America."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Next month we'll begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The economic outlook for this year is one of steady growth--if we are vigilant.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"True, there are some clouds on the horizon."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Prices are rising.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Interest rates have passed the peak of 1966; and if there is continued inaction on the tax bill, they will climb even higher."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"I warn the Congress and the Nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep us into an accelerating spiral of price increases, a slump in homebuilding, and a continuing erosion of the American dollar."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This would be a tragedy for every American family.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"And I predict that if this happens, they will all let us know about it."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We--those of us in the executive branch, in the Congress, and the leaders of labor and business--must do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Under the new budget, the expenditures for 1969 will increase by $10.4 billion."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Receipts will increase by $22.3 billion including the added tax revenues.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Virtually all of this expenditure increase represents the mandatory cost of our defense efforts, $3 billion; increased interest, almost $1 billion; or mandatory payments under laws passed by Congress--such as those provided in the Social Security Act that you passed in 1967, and to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, veterans, and farmers, of about $4 1/2 billion; and the additional $1 billion 600 million next year for the pay increases that you passed in military and civilian pay."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,That makes up the $10 billion that is added to the budget.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"With few exceptions, very few, we are holding the fiscal 1969 budget to last year's level, outside of those mandatory and required increases."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,A Presidential commission composed of distinguished congressional fiscal leaders and other prominent Americans recommended this year that we adopt a new budget approach.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I am carrying out their recommendations in this year's budget.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"This budget, therefore, for the first time accurately covers all Federal expenditures and all Federal receipts, including for the first time in one budget $47 billion from the social security, Medicare, highway, and other trust funds."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"The fiscal 1969 budget has expenditures of approximately $186 billion, with total estimated revenues, including the tax bill, of about $178 billion."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"If the Congress enacts the tax increase, we will reduce the budget deficit by some $12 billion."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,The war in Vietnam is costing us about $25 billion and we are asking for about $12 billion in taxes--and if we get that $12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $20 billion in 1968 to about $8 billion in 1969.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Now, this is a tight budget."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,It follows the reduction that I made in cooperation with the Congress--a reduction made after you had reviewed every appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $5 or $6 billion and expenditures by $1.5 billion.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We conferred together and I recommended to the Congress and you subsequently approved taking 2 percent from payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We therefore reduced appropriations almost $10 billion last session and expenditures over $4 billion.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Now, that was in the budget last year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I ask the Congress to recognize that there are certain selected programs that meet the Nation's most urgent needs and they have increased.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We have insisted that decreases in very desirable but less urgent programs be made before we would approve any increases.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"So I ask the Congress tonight: --to hold its appropriations to the budget requests, and --to act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which for the average American individual amounts to about a penny out of each dollar's income."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,This tax increase would yield about half of the $23 billion per year that we returned to the people in the tax reduction bills of 1964 and 1965.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"This must be a temporary measure, which expires in less than 2 years."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Congress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But Congress can never repeal inflation.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"The leaders of American business and the leaders of American labor--those who really have power over wages and prices--must act responsibly, and in their Nation's interest by keeping increases in line with productivity."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"If our recognized leaders do not do this, they and those for whom they speak and all of us are going to suffer very serious consequences."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"On January 1st, I outlined a program to reduce our balance of payments deficit sharply this year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We will ask the Congress to help carry out those parts of the program which require legislation.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We must restore equilibrium to our balance of payments.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We must also strengthen the international monetary system.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We have assured the world that America's full gold stock stands behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at $35 an ounce.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We must back this commitment by legislating now to free our gold reserves.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Americans, traveling more than any other people in history, took $4 billion out of their country last year in travel costs."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,We must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $2 billion.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"We are hoping that we can reduce it by $500 million--without unduly penalizing the travel of teachers, students, business people who have essential and necessary travel, or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to see."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Even with this reduction of $500 million, the American people will still be traveling more overseas than they did in 1967, 1966, or 1965 or any other year in their history."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"If we act together as I hope we can, I believe we can continue our economic expansion which has already broken all past records."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,And I hope that we can continue that expansion in the days ahead.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Each of these questions I have discussed with you tonight is a question of policy for our people.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"Therefore, each of them should be--and doubtless will be--debated by candidates for public office this year."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,I hope those debates will be marked by new proposals and by a seriousness that matches the gravity of the questions themselves.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,These are not appropriate subjects for narrow partisan oratory.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"They go to the heart of what we Americans are all about--all of us, Democrats and Republicans."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Tonight I have spoken of some of the goals I should like to see America reach.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Many of them can be achieved this year--others by the time we celebrate our Nation's 200th birthday--the bicentennial of our independence.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Several of these goals are going to be very hard to reach.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,But the State of our Union will be much stronger 8 years from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach these goals now.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,They are more important--much more important--than the identity of the party or the President who will then be in office.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,These goals are what the fighting and our alliances are really meant to protect.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Can we achieve these goals?
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Of course we can--if we will.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"If ever there was a people who sought more than mere abundance, it is our people."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"If ever there was a nation that was capable of solving its problems, it is this Nation."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,If ever there were a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of being an American--it is this time.
1968,Johnson,Democratic,"So this, my friends, is the State of our Union: seeking, building, tested many times in this past year--and always equal to the test."
1968,Johnson,Democratic,Thank you and good night.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,PRESIDENT LYNDON B.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"JOHNSON'S ANNUAL MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 14, 1969 Mr."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"President, Members of the Congress and my fellow, Americans: For the sixth and the last time, I present to the Congress my assessment of the State of the Union."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity--and about the commitments that all of us have made together that will, if we carry them out, give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Every President lives, not only with what is, but with what has been and what could be."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Most of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence extending back through several years and extending back through several other administrations.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Urban unrest, poverty, pressures on welfare, education of our people, law enforcement and law and order, the continuing crisis in the Middle East, the conflict in Vietnam, the dangers of nuclear war, the great difficulties of dealing with the Communist powers, all have this much in common: They and their causes--the causes that gave rise to them--all of these have existed with us for many years."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Several Presidents have already sought to try to deal with them.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,One or more Presidents will try to resolve them or try to contain them in the years that are ahead of us.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"But if the Nation's problems are continuing, so are this great Nation's assets: --our economy, --the democratic system, --our sense of exploration, symbolized most recently by the wonderful flight of the Apollo 8, in which all Americans took great pride, --the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people, and --their essential love of justice."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We must not ignore our problems.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But neither should we ignore our strengths.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Those strengths are available to sustain a President of either party--to support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Unfortunately, the departure of an administration does not mean the end of the problems that this administration has faced."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"The effort to meet the problems must go on, year after year, if the momentum that we have all mounted together in these past years is not to be lost."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Although the struggle for progressive change is continuous, there are times when a watershed is reached--when there is--if not really a break with the past--at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes, and a stepping forth into a new environment, to seek new goals."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think the past 5 years have been such a time.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We have finished a major part of the old agenda.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Some of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken on the flesh of achievement."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Medicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of American life.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Voting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the fifties, and the doors to public service, are open at last to all Americans regardless of their color."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Schools and school children all over America tonight are receiving Federal assistance to go to good schools.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Preschool education--Head Start--is already here to stay and, I think, so are the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities of this country."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Part of the American earth--not only in description on a map, but in the reality of our shores, our hills, our parks, our forests, and our mountains--has been permanently set aside for the American public and for their benefit."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,And there is more that will be set aside before this administration ends.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Five million Americans have been trained for jobs in new Federal programs.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this Nation is close to full employment--with less unemployment than we have had at any time in almost 20 years.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,That is not in theory; that is in fact.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Tonight, the unemployment rate is down to 3.3 percent."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The number of jobs has grown more than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 years.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,That is more than in all the preceding 12 years.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"These achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and, finally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and the administration achieved during this period had already completed that cycle.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding to become a tangible realization.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Yet the very existence of these commitments--these promises to the American people, made by this Congress and by the executive branch of the Government--are achievements in themselves, and failure to carry through on our commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,This much is certain: No one man or group of men made these commitments alone.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Congress and the executive branch, with their checks and balances, reasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,They now have all the moral force that the American political system can summon when it acts as one.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,They express America's common determination to achieve goals.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,They imply action.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In most cases, you have already begun that action--but it is not fully completed, of course."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Let me speak for a moment about these commitments.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I am going to speak in the language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these measures.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I am going to quote from your words.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In 1966, Congress declared that ""improving the quality of urban life is the most critical domestic problem facing the United States."" Two years later it affirmed the historic goal of ""a decent home . . . for every American family."" That is your language."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Now to meet these commitments, we must increase our support for the model cities program, where blueprints of change are already being prepared in more than 150 American cities To achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already passed, we should begin this year more than 500,000 homes for needy families in the coming fiscal year."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Funds are provided in the new budget to do just this.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,This is almost 10 times--10 times--the average rate of the past 10 years.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Our cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of their growing populations.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,So I believe an urban development bank should be created by the Congress.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"This bank could obtain resources through the issuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced rates to the communities throughout the land for schools, hospitals, parks, and other public facilities."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Since we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935, Congress has recognized the necessity to ""make more adequate provision for aged persons . . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public health."" Those are the words of the Congress--""more adequate."" The time has come, I think, to make it more adequate."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe we should increase social security benefits, and I am so recommending tonight."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at least 13 percent.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Those who receive only the minimum of $55 should get $80 a month.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Our Nation, too, is rightfully proud of our medical advances."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But we should remember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its infant mortality rate.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their children during the first year of their life in the United States of America.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of catastrophic illness.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"As we pass on from medicine, I think nothing is clearer to the Congress than the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Congress expressed it well, I think, in 1964, when they said: ""It is the policy of the United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation."" This is the richest nation in the world."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The antipoverty program has had many achievements.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,It also has some failures.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But we must not cripple it after only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been with us and have been building up among us for generations.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to other agencies.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe, though, it will want to continue, until we have broken the back of poverty, the efforts we are now making throughout this land."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe, and I hope the next administration--I believe they believe--that the key to success in this effort is jobs."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,It is work for people who want to work.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In the budget for fiscal 1970, I shall recommend a total of $3.5 billion for our job training program, and that is five times as much as we spent in 1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their own living."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The Nation's commitment in the field of civil rights began with the Declaration of Independence.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"They were extended by the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of three far-reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years, that this Congress, in its wisdom, passed."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"On January 1 of this year, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20 million American homes and apartments."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously enforced throughout this land.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting Rights Act for another 5 years.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In the Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress determined ""To assist state and local governments in reducing the incidence of crime."" This year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full $300 million that the Congress last year authorized to do just that."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the United States.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I hope these grants can be made to the States and they can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be made--I think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nation--if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Frankly, as I leave the Office of the Presidency, one of my greatest disappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearms."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I think if we had passed that act, it would have reduced the incidence of crime."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe that the Congress should adopt such a law, and I hope that it will at a not too distant date."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In order to meet our long-standing commitment to make government as efficient as possible, I believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the lines of the Kappel1 report."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve their country.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Later this week, I shall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership this evening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the Commission's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"For Members of Congress, I will recommend the basic compensation not of the $50,000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the other distinguished Members, but I shall reduce that $50,000 to $42,500."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I will suggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expenses, so that Members will not be required to use their salary increase for essential official business."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I would have submitted the Commission's recommendations, except the advice that I received from the leadership--and you usually are consulted about matters that affect the Congress--was that the Congress would not accept the $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my recommendation to be seriously considered, I should make substantial reductions."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,That is the only reason I didn't go along with the Kappel report.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,In 1967 I recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all of these commitments I talk about will cost money.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"If we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8 years, I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these commitments."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We have already been able to increase our support for major social programs--although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything on the home front because of Vietnam; but we have been able in the last 5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education from $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming fiscal year.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,That is more than double.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188 years of this Republic, notwithstanding Vietnam."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Greater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last year have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January when we made our estimates.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"At that time, you will remember that we estimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Well, I am glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this June, we are going to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a $2.4 billion surplus."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,You will receive the budget tomorrow.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"The budget for the next fiscal year, that begins July 1--which you will want to examine very carefully in the days ahead--will provide a $3.4 billion surplus."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,This budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted last year.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I have communicated with the President-elect, Mr."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Nixon, in connection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as circumstances will permit, but the President-elect has told me that he has concluded that until his administration, and this Congress, can examine the appropriation bills, and each item in the budget, and can ascertain that the facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced, he, Mr."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Nixon, will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Americans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will bring an early peace to Vietnam."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"And if our hopes for an early settlement of the war are realized, then our military expenditures can be reduced and very substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable purposes, as the Congress may determine."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In any event, I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I think all Americans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep, and it has brought record profits, the highest in our history, and record wages."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Our gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any other period in our Nation's history.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Our wages have been the highest.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Our profits have been the best.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,This prosperity has enabled millions to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the Treasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have achieved a surplus.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"It appears that we have, in fact, done better this year than we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"The quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every administration since the end of World War II."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"It has required us to seek a limitation of arms races not only among the superpowers, but among the smaller nations as well."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963, the outer space treaty of 1967, and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,This latter agreement--the nonproliferation treaty--is now pending in the Senate and it has been pending there since last July.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In my opinion, delay in ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,America took the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps to have it approved at the earliest possible date.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Until a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the superpowers, mankind cannot view the future without fear and great apprehension."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"So, I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet Union about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think they would already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election this year.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,It was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to aid the developing nations.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We knew then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"During these years there have been great advances made under our program, particularly against want and hunger, although we are disappointed at the appropriations last year."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We thought they were woefully inadequate.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,This year I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Among those efforts, that of Western Europe has a very special place in America's concern."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role that its resources permit is to go forward to unity.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I think America remains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner on the basis of equality."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"For the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires: --that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become the leading nation in world trade, --that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity, and --that we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests of both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The strained relationship between us and the world's leading Communist power has not ended--especially in the light of the brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are able to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world catastrophe.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"What we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,We earnestly hope that time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and individual freedom.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"The quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam, and in the Paris talks."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore peace to South Vietnam.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"The prospects, I think, for peace are better today than at any time since North Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years ago."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"The free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time: that America cares about their freedom, and it also cares about America's own vital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive purposes by force.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"There may be hard fighting before a settlement is reached; but, I can assure you, it will yield no victory to the Communist cause."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal tribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I have been honored to be their Commander in Chief.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The Nation owes them its unstinting support while the battle continues--and its enduring gratitude when their service is done.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Finally, the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many capitals tonight."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the U.N.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Security Council which points the way.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,There must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"It is a threat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States, but it is a threat to every one of us and to the entire world as well."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Now, my friends in Congress, I want to conclude with a few very personal words to you."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional leadership's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I did that for two reasons.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,One was philosophical.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I wanted to give you my judgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I view them, before I leave."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,The other was just pure sentimental.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Most all of my life as a public official has been spent here in this building.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"For 38 years--since I worked on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of Representatives--I have known these halls, and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked them."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I know the questions that you face.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I know the conflicts that you endure.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I know the ideals that you seek to serve.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I left here first to become Vice President, and then to become, in a moment of tragedy, the President of the United States."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"My term of office has been marked by a series of challenges, both at home and throughout the world."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In meeting some of these challenges, the Nation has found a new confidence."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"In meeting others, it knew turbulence and doubt, and fear and hate."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Throughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in representative democracy--a faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an employee and as a Congressman and as a Senator."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation--described by the Constitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and given life by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow citizens."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Now for 5 most demanding years in the White House, I have been strengthened by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents, Harry S."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Truman and Dwight David Eisenhower.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I have been guided by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved John F.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Kennedy, and with our greatest modern legislator, Speaker Sam Rayburn."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I have been assisted by my friend every step of the way, Vice President Hubert Humphrey."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the loyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield, and I am sure that I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel of the President Pro Tem of the Senate, Senator Richard Brevard Russell."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, Senator Dirksen and Congressman Gerald Ford, the Minority Leader."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"No President should ask for more, although I did upon occasions."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But few Presidents have ever been blessed with so much.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"President-elect Nixon, in the days ahead, is going to need your understanding, just as I did."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,And he is entitled to have it.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I hope every Member will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President, will be borne for all of us."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,Each of us should try not to increase these burdens for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"Now, it is time to leave."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,"I hope it may be said, a hundred years from now, that by working together we helped to make our country more just, more just for all of its people, as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of liberty for all of our posterity."
1969,Johnson,Democratic,That is what I hope.
1969,Johnson,Democratic,But I believe that at least it will be said that we tried.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"January 22, 1970 Mr."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"President, my colleagues in the Congress, our distinguished guests and my fellow Americans: To address a joint session of the Congress in this great Chamber in which I was once privileged to serve is an honor for which I am deeply grateful."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The State of the Union Address is traditionally an occasion for a lengthy and detailed account by the President of what he has accomplished in the past, what he wants the Congress to do in the future, and, in an election year, to lay the basis for the political issues which might be decisive in the fall."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Occasionally there comes a time when profound and far-reaching events command a break with tradition.
1970,Nixon,Republican,This is such a time.
1970,Nixon,Republican,I say this not only because 1970 marks the beginning of a new decade in which America will celebrate its 200th birthday.
1970,Nixon,Republican,I say it because new knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our programs and our institutions in America need to be reformed.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The moment has arrived to harness the vast energies and abundance of this land to the creation of a new American experience, an experience richer and deeper and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The seventies will be a time of new beginnings, a time of exploring both on the earth and in the heavens, a time of discovery."
1970,Nixon,Republican,But the time has also come for emphasis on developing better ways of managing what we have and of completing what man¡¦s genius has begun but left unfinished.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Our land, this land that is ours together, is a great and a good land."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"It is also an unfinished land, and the challenge of perfecting it is the summons of the seventies."
1970,Nixon,Republican,It is in that spirit that I address myself to those great issues facing our Nation which are above partisanship.
1970,Nixon,Republican,When we speak of America¡¦s priorities the first priority must always be peace for America and the world.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the war in Vietnam in a way that our generation will be remembered¡Xnot so much as the generation that suffered in war, but more for the fact that we had the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next generation was able to keep."
1970,Nixon,Republican,We are making progress toward that goal.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The prospects for peace are far greater today than they were a year ago.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"A major part of the credit for this development goes to the Members of this Congress who, despite their differences on the conduct of the war, have overwhelmingly indicated their support of a just peace."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"By this action, you have completely demolished the enemy¡¦s hopes that they can gain in Washington the victory our fighting men have denied them in Vietnam."
1970,Nixon,Republican,No goal could be greater than to make the next generation the first in this century in which America was at peace with every nation in the world.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I shall discuss in detail the new concepts and programs designed to achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy, which I shall submit to the Congress at a later date."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Today, let me describe the directions of our new policies."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We have based our policies on an evaluation of the world as it is, not as it was 25 years ago at the conclusion of World War II."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Many of the policies which were necessary and right then are obsolete today.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Then, because of America¡¦s overwhelming military and economic strength, because of the weakness of other major free world powers and the inability of scores of newly independent nations to defend, or even govern, themselves, America had to assume the major burden for the defense of freedom in the world."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In two wars, first in Korea and now in Vietnam, we furnished most of the money, most of the arms, most of the men to help other nations defend their freedom."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Today the treat industrial nations of Europe, as well as Japan, have regained their economic strength; and the nations of Latin America¡Xand many of the nations who acquired their freedom from colonialism after World War II in Asia and Africa¡Xhave a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to assume the responsibility for their own defense."
1970,Nixon,Republican,That is the basis of the doctrine I announced at Guam. 1 Neither the defense nor the development of other nations can be exclusively or primarily an American undertaking.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The nations of each part of the world should assume the primary responsibility for their own well-being; and they themselves should determine the terms of that well-being.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We shall be faithful to our treaty commitments, but we shall reduce our involvement and our presence in other nations¡¦ affairs."
1970,Nixon,Republican,To insist that other nations play a role is not a retreat from responsibility; it is a sharing of responsibility.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The result of this new policy has been not to weaken our alliances, but to give them new life, new strength, a new sense of common purpose."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Relations with our European allies are once again strong and healthy, based on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility."
1970,Nixon,Republican,We have initiated a new approach to Latin America in which we deal with those nations as partners rather than patrons.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The new partnership concept has been welcomed in Asia.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We have developed a historic new basis for Japanese-American friendship and cooperation, which is the linchpin for peace in the Pacific."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"If we are to have peace in the last third of the century, a major factor will be the development of a new relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I would not underestimate our differences, but we are moving with precision and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Our negotiations on strategic arms limitations and in other areas will have far greater chance for success if both sides enter them motivated by mutual self-interest rather than na?ve sentimentality.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It is with this same spirit that we have resumed discussions with Communist China in our talks at Warsaw.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Our concern in our relations with both these nations is to avoid a catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of our differences.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I would be the last to suggest that the road to peace is not difficult and dangerous, but I believe our new policies have contributed to the prospect that America may have the best chance since World War II to enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"And that chance will be enormously increased if we continue to have a relationship between Congress and the Executive in which, despite differences in detail, where the security of America and the peace of mankind are concerned, we act not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"As we move into the decade of the seventies, we have the greatest opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Our gross national product will increase by $500 billion in the next 10 years.
1970,Nixon,Republican,This increase alone is greater than the entire growth of the American economy from 1790 to 1950.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The critical question is not whether we will grow, but how we will use that growth."
1970,Nixon,Republican,The decade of the sixties was also a period of great growth economically.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But in that same 10-year period we witnessed the greatest growth of crime, the greatest increase in inflation, the greatest social unrest in America in 100 years."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed it less.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"At heart, the issue is the effectiveness of government."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Ours has become¡Xas it continues to be, and should remain¡Xa society of large expectations."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Government helped to generate these expectations.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It undertook to meet them.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Yet, increasingly, it proved unable to do so."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"As a people, we had too many visions¡Xand too little vision."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Now, as we enter the seventies, we should enter also a great age of reform of the institutions of American government."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Our purpose in this period should not be simply better management of the programs of the past.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The time has come for a new quest¡Xa quest not for a greater quantity of what we have, but for a new quality of life in America."
1970,Nixon,Republican,A major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this Nation¡¦s approach to its problems and opportunities is contained in more than two score legislative proposals which I sent to the Congress last year and which still await enactment.
1970,Nixon,Republican,I will offer at least a dozen more major programs in the course of this session.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"At this point I do not intend to go through a detailed listing of what I have proposed or will propose, but I would like to mention three areas in which urgent priorities demand that we move and move now: First, we cannot delay longer in accomplishing a total reform of our welfare system."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"When a system penalizes work, breaks up homes, robs recipients of dignity, there is no alternative to abolishing that system and adopting in its place the program of income support, job training, and work incentives which I recommended to the Congress last year."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Second, the time has come to assess and reform all of our institutions of government at the Federal, State, and local level."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"It is time for a New Federalism, in which, after 190 years of power flowing from the people and local and State governments to Washington, D.C., it will begin to flow from Washington back to the States and to the people of the United States."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Third, we must adopt reforms which will expand the range of opportunities for all Americans."
1970,Nixon,Republican,We can fulfill the American dream only when each person has a fair chance to fulfill his own dreams.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"This means equal voting rights, equal employment opportunity, and new opportunities for expanded ownership."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Because in order to be secure in their human rights, people need access to property rights."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I could give similar examples of the need for reform in our programs for health, education, housing, transportation, as well as other critical areas which directly affect the well-being of millions of Americans."
1970,Nixon,Republican,The people of the United States should wait no longer for these reforms that would so deeply enhance the quality of their life.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"When I speak of actions which would be beneficial to the American people, I can think of none more important than for the Congress to join this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Now, I realize it is tempting to blame someone else for inflation."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Some blame business for raising prices.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Some blame unions for asking for more wages.
1970,Nixon,Republican,But a review of the stark fiscal facts of the 1960¡¦s clearly demonstrates where the primary blame for rising prices must be placed.
1970,Nixon,Republican,In the decade of the sixties the Federal Government spent $57 billion more than it took in in taxes.
1970,Nixon,Republican,In the same decade the American people paid the bill for that deficit in price increases which raised the cost of living for the average family of four by $200 per month in America.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Now millions of Americans are forced to go into debt today because the Federal Government decided to go into debt yesterday.
1970,Nixon,Republican,We must balance our Federal budget so that American families will have a better chance to balance their family budgets.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Only with the cooperation of the Congress can we meet this highest priority objective of responsible government.
1970,Nixon,Republican,We are on the right track.
1970,Nixon,Republican,We had a balanced budget in 1969.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"This administration cut more than $7 billion out of spending plans in order to produce a surplus in 1970, and in spite of the fact that Congress reduced revenues by $ 3 billion, I shall recommend a balanced budget for 1971."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But I can assure that not only to present, but to stay within, a balanced budget requires some very hard decisions."
1970,Nixon,Republican,It means rejecting spending programs which would benefit some of the people when their net effect would result in price increases for all the people.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It is time to quit putting good money into bad programs.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Otherwise, we will end up with bad money and bad programs."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I recognize the political popularity of spending programs, and particularly in an election year."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But unless we stop the rise in prices, the cost of living for millions of American families will become unbearable and government¡¦s ability to plan programs for progress for the future will become impossible."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In referring to budget cuts, there is one area where I have ordered an increase rather than a cut¡Xand that is the requests of those agencies with the responsibilities for law enforcement."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in which the word ¡§war¡¨ has perhaps too often been used¡Xthe war on poverty, the war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger."
1970,Nixon,Republican,But if there is one area where the word ¡§war¡¨ is appropriate it is in the fight against crime.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which increasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and our lives."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We have a tragic example of this problem in the Nation¡¦s Capital, for whose safety the Congress and the Executive have the primary responsibility."
1970,Nixon,Republican,I doubt if many Members of this Congress who live more than a few blocks from here would dare leave their cars in the Capitol garage and walk home alone tonight.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Last year this administration sent to the Congress 13 separate pieces of legislation dealing with organized crime, pornography, street crime, narcotics, crime in the District of Columbia."
1970,Nixon,Republican,None of these bills has reached my desk for signature.
1970,Nixon,Republican,I am confident that the Congress will act now to adopt the legislation I placed before you last year.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We in the Executive have done everything we can under existing law, but new and stronger weapons are needed in that fight."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"While it is true that State and local law enforcement agencies are the cutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime, burglaries, murder, my proposals to you have embodied my belief that the Federal Government should play a greater role in working in partnership with these agencies."
1970,Nixon,Republican,That is why 1971 Federal spending for local law enforcement will double that budgeted for 1970.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The primary responsibility for crimes that affect individuals is with local and State rather than with Federal Government.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But in the field of organized crime, narcotics, pornography, the Federal Government has a special responsibility it should fulfill."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"And we should make Washington, D.C., where we have the primary responsibility, an example to the Nation and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I now turn to a subject which, next to our desire for peace, may well become the major concern of the American people in the decade of the seventies."
1970,Nixon,Republican,In the next 10 years we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The profound question is: Does this mean we will be 50 percent richer in a real sense, 50 percent better off, 50 percent happier?"
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Or does it mean that in the year 1980 the President standing in this place will look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people lived in metropolitan areas chocked by traffic, suffocated by smog, poisoned by water, deafened by noise, and terrorized by crime?"
1970,Nixon,Republican,These are not the great questions that concern world leaders at summit conferences.
1970,Nixon,Republican,But people do not live at the summit.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"They live in the foothills of everyday experience, and it is time for all of us to concern ourselves with the way real people live in real life."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The great question of the seventies is, shall we surrender to our surroundings, or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land, and to our water?"
1970,Nixon,Republican,Restoring nature to its natural state is a cause beyond party and beyond factions.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It has become a common cause of all the people of this country.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"It is a cause of particular concern to young Americans, because they more than we will reap the grim consequences of our failure to act on programs which are needed now if we are to prevent disaster later."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Clean air, clean water, open spaces¡Xthese should once again be the birthright of every American."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"If we act now, they can be."
1970,Nixon,Republican,We still think of air as free.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But clean air is not free, and neither is clean water."
1970,Nixon,Republican,The price tag on pollution control is high.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Through our years of past carelessness we incurred a debt to nature, and now that debt is being called."
1970,Nixon,Republican,The program I shall propose to Congress will be the most comprehensive and costly program in this field in America¡¦s history.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It is not a program for just one year.
1970,Nixon,Republican,A year¡¦s plan in this field is no plan at all.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"This is a time to look ahead not a year, but 5 years or 10 years¡Xwhatever time is required to do the job."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I shall propose to this Congress a $10 billion nationwide clean waters program to put modern municipal waste treatment plants in every place in America where they are needed to make our waters clean again, and do it now."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We have the industrial capacity, if we begin now, to build them all within 5 years."
1970,Nixon,Republican,This program will get them built within 5 years.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"As our cities and suburbs relentlessly expand, those priceless open spaces needed for recreation areas accessible to their people are swallowed up¡Xoften forever."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Unless we preserve these spaces while they are still available, we will have none to preserve."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Therefore, I shall propose new financing methods for purchasing open space and parklands now, before they are lost to us."
1970,Nixon,Republican,The automobile is our worst polluter of the air.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Adequate control requires further advances in engine design and fuel composition.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We shall intensify our research, set increasingly strict standards, and strengthen enforcement procedures¡Xand we shall do it now."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We can no longer afford to consider air and water common property, free to be abused by anyone without regard to the consequences."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Instead, we should begin now to treat them as scarce resources, which we are no more free to contaminate than we are free to throw garbage into our neighbor¡¦s yard."
1970,Nixon,Republican,This requires comprehensive new regulations.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"It also requires that, to the extent possible, the price of goods should be made to include the costs of producing and disposing of them without damage to the environment."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Now, I realize that the argument is often made that there is a fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life, so that to have one we must forsake the other."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"The answer is not to abandon growth, but to redirect it."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"For example, we should turn toward ending congestion and eliminating smog the same reservoir of inventive genius that created them in the first place."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Continued vigorous economic growth provides us with the means to enrich life itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Each individual must enlist in this fight if it is to be won.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"It has been said that no matter how many national parks and historical monuments we buy and develop, the truly significant environment for each of us is that in which we spend 80 percent of our time¡Xin our homes, in our places of work, the streets over which we travel."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Street litter, rundown parking strips and yards, dilapidated fences, broken windows, smoking automobiles, dingy working places, all should be the object of our fresh view."
1970,Nixon,Republican,We have been too tolerant of our surroundings and too willing to leave it to others to clean up our environment.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It is time for those who make massive demands on society to make some minimal demands on themselves.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Each of us must resolve that each day he will leave his home, his property, the public places of the city or town a little cleaner, a little better, a little more pleasant for himself and those around him."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"With the help of people we can do anything, and without their help, we can do nothing."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In this spirit, together, we can reclaim our land for ours and generations to come."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Between now and the year 2000, over 100 million children will be born in the United States."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Where they grow up¡Xand how¡Xwill, more than any one thing, measure the quality of American life in these years ahead."
1970,Nixon,Republican,This should be a warning to us.
1970,Nixon,Republican,For the past 30 years our population has also been growing and shifting.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The result is exemplified in the vast areas of rural America emptying out of people and of promise¡Xa third of our countries lost population in the sixties.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The violent and decayed central cities of our great metropolitan complexes are the most conspicuous area of failure in American life today.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I propose that before these problems become insoluble, the Nation develop a national growth policy."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In the future, government decisions as to where to build highways, locate airports, acquire land, or sell land should be made with a clear objective of aiding a balanced growth for America."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In particular, the Federal Government must be in a position to assist in the building of new cities and the rebuilding of old ones."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"At the same time, we will carry our concern with the quality of life in America to the farm as well as the suburb, to the village as well as to the city."
1970,Nixon,Republican,What rural America needs most is a new kind of assistance.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"It needs to be dealt with, not as a separate nation, but as part of an overall growth policy for America."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We must create a new rural environment which will not only stem the migration to urban centers, but reverse it."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"If we seize our growth as a challenge, we can make the 1970¡¦s a historic period when by conscious choice we transformed our land into what we want it to become."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"America, which has pioneered in the new abundance, and in the new technology, is called upon today to pioneer in meeting the concerns which have followed in their wake¡Xin turning the wonders of science to the service of man."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In the majesty of this great Chamber we hear the echoes of America¡¦s history, of debates that rocked the Union and those that repaired it, of the summons to war and the search for peace, of the uniting of the people, the building of a nation."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Those echoes of history remind us of our roots and our strengths.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"They remind us also of that special genius of American democracy, which at one critical turning point after another has led us to spot the new road to the future and given us the wisdom and the courage to take it."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"As I look down that new road which I have tried to map out today, I see a new America as we celebrate our 200th anniversary 6 years from now."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I see an America in which we have abolished hunger, provided the means for every family in the Nation to obtain a minimum income, made enormous progress in providing better housing, faster transportation, improved health, and superior education."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I see an America in which we have checked inflation, and waged a winning war against crime."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"I see an America in which we have made great strides in stopping the pollution of our air, cleaning up our water, opening up our parks, continuing to explore in space."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Most important, I see an America at peace with all the nations of the world."
1970,Nixon,Republican,This is not an impossible dream.
1970,Nixon,Republican,These goals are all within our reach.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"In times past, our forefathers had the vision but not the means to achieve such goals."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Let it not be recorded that we were the first American generation that had the means but not the vision to make this dream come true.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But let us, above all, recognize a fundamental truth."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We can be the best clothed, best fed, best housed people in the world, enjoying clean air, clean water, beautiful parks, but we could still be the unhappiest people in the world without an indefinable spirit¡Xthe lift of a driving dream which has made America, from its beginning, the hope of the world."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Two hundred years ago this was a new nation of 3 million people, weak militarily, poor economically."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"But America meant something to the world then which could not be measured in dollars, something far more important than military might."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Listen to President Thomas Jefferson in 1802: We act not ¡§for ourselves along, but for the whole human race.¡¨ We had a spiritual quality then which caught the imagination of millions of people in the world."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Today, when we are the richest and strongest nation in the world, let it not be recorded that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which made us the hope of the world at the time of our birth."
1970,Nixon,Republican,The demands of us in 1976 are even greater than in 1776.
1970,Nixon,Republican,It is no longer enough to live and let live.
1970,Nixon,Republican,Now we must live and help live.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"We need a fresh climate in America, one in which a person can breathe freely and breathe in freedom."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness are not the same thing requires us to measure success or failure by new criteria.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Even more than the programs I have described today, what this Nation needs is an example from its elected leaders in providing the spiritual and moral leadership which no programs for material progress can satisfy."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"Above all, let us inspire young Americans with a sense of excitement, a sense of destiny, a sense of involvement, in meeting the challenges we face in this great period of our history."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Only then are they going to have any sense of satisfaction in their lives.
1970,Nixon,Republican,The greatest privilege an individual can have is to serve in a cause bigger than himself.
1970,Nixon,Republican,We have such a cause.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"How we seize the opportunities I have described today will determine not only our future, but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the last third of the century."
1970,Nixon,Republican,"May God give us the wisdom, the strength and, above all, the idealism to be worthy of that challenge, so that America can fulfill its destiny of being the world¡¦s best hope for liberty, for opportunity, for progress and peace for all peoples."
1970,Nixon,Republican,Note: The President delivered his address at 12:30 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol before a joint session of the Congress.
1970,Nixon,Republican,He was introduced by Speaker of the House of Representatives John W.
1970,Nixon,Republican,McCormack of Massachusetts.
1970,Nixon,Republican,"On the same day an advance text of the President¡¦s address was released by the White House Press Office. 1 See 1969 volume, Item 279. ?? ?? ?? ??"
1971,Nixon,Republican,Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"January 22, 1971 Mr."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"President, my colleagues in the Congress, our distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: As this 92d Congress begins its session, America has lost a great Senator, and all of us who had the privilege to know him have lost a loyal friend."
1971,Nixon,Republican,I had the privilege of visiting Senator Russell in the hospital just a few days before he died.
1971,Nixon,Republican,He never spoke about himself.
1971,Nixon,Republican,He only spoke eloquently about the need for a strong national defense.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"In tribute to one of the most magnificent Americans of all time, I respectfully ask that all those here will rise in silent prayer for Senator Russell. ¡@[Moment of silence] ¡@Thank you."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Mr.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, before I begin my formal address, I want to use this opportunity to congratulate all of those who were winners in the rather spirited contest for leadership positions in the House and the Senate and, also, to express my condolences to the losers."
1971,Nixon,Republican,I know how both of you feel.
1971,Nixon,Republican,And I particularly want to join with all of the Members of the House and the Senate as well in congratulating the new Speaker of the United States Congress.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"To those new Members of this House who may have some doubts about the possibilities for advancement in the years ahead, I would remind you that the Speaker and I met just 24 years ago in this Chamber as freshmen Members of the 80th Congress."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As you see, we both have come up in the world a bit since then."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Mr.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, this 92d Congress has a chance to be recorded as the greatest Congress in America¡¦s history."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"In these troubled years just past, America has been going through a long nightmare of war and division, of crime and inflation."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Even more deeply, we have gone through a long, dark night of the American spirit."
1971,Nixon,Republican,But now that night is ending.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Now we must let our spirits soar again.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Now we are ready for the lift of a driving dream.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The people of this Nation are eager to get on with the quest for new greatness.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"They see challenges, and they are prepared to meet those challenges."
1971,Nixon,Republican,It is for us here to open the doors that will set free again the real greatness of this Nation¡Xthe genius of the American people.
1971,Nixon,Republican,How shall we meet this challenge?
1971,Nixon,Republican,"How can we truly open the doors, and set free the full genius of our people?"
1971,Nixon,Republican,The way in which the 92d Congress answers these questions will determine its place in history.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"More importantly, it can determine this Nation¡¦s place in history as we enter the third century of our independence."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Tonight I shall present to the Congress six great goals.
1971,Nixon,Republican,I shall ask not simply for more new programs in the old framework.
1971,Nixon,Republican,I shall ask to change the framework of government itself¡Xto reform the entire structure of American government so we can make it again fully responsive to the needs and the wishes of the American people.
1971,Nixon,Republican,If we act boldly¡Xif we size this moment and achieve these goals¡Xwe can close the gap between promise and performance in American government.
1971,Nixon,Republican,We can bring together the resources of this Nation and the spirit of the American people.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"In discussing these great goals, I shall deal tonight only with matters on the domestic side of the Nation¡¦s agenda."
1971,Nixon,Republican,I shall make a separate report to the Congress and the Nation next month on developments in foreign policy.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The first of these great goals is already before the Congress.
1971,Nixon,Republican,I urge that the unfinished business of the 91st Congress be made the first priority business of the 92d Congress.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Over the next 2 weeks, I will call upon Congress to take action on more than 35 pieces of proposed legislation on which action was not completed last year."
1971,Nixon,Republican,The most important is welfare reform.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The present welfare system has become a monstrous, consuming outrage¡Xan outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularly against the children it is supposed to help."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"We may honestly disagree, as we do, on what to do about it."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"But we can all agree that we must meet the challenge, not by pouring more money into a bad program, but by abolishing the present welfare system and adopting a new one."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"So let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in America¡Xand without those demeaning, soul-stifling affronts to human dignity that so blight the lives of welfare children today."
1971,Nixon,Republican,But let us also establish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves.
1971,Nixon,Republican,This shall be our goal.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us generously help those who are not able to help themselves.
1971,Nixon,Republican,But let us stop helping those who are able to help themselves but refuse to do so.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The second great goal is to achieve what Americans have not enjoyed since 1957¡Xfull prosperity in peacetime.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The tide of inflation has turned.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The rise in the cost of living, which had been gathering dangerous momentum in the late sixties, was reduced last year."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Inflation will be further reduced this year.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"But as we have moved from runaway inflation toward reasonable price stability and at the same time as we have been moving from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy, we have paid a price in increased unemployment."
1971,Nixon,Republican,We should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy is lower than in any peacetime year of the sixties.
1971,Nixon,Republican,This is not good enough for the man who is unemployed in the seventies.
1971,Nixon,Republican,We must do better for workers in peacetime and we will do better.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"To achieve this, I will admit an expansionary budget this year¡Xone that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunities for millions of Americans."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"It will be a full employment budget, a budget designed to be in balance if the economy were operating at its peak potential."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"By spending as if we were at full employment, we will help to bring about full employment."
1971,Nixon,Republican,I ask the Congress to accept these expansionary policies¡Xto accept the concept of a full employment budget.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"At the same time, I ask the Congress to cooperate in resisting expenditures that go beyond the limits of the full employment budget."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"For as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely shared prosperity, we must not reignite the fires of inflation and so undermine that prosperity."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"With the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget, with the commitment of the independent Federal Reserve System to provide fully for the monetary needs of a growing economy, and with a much greater effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage and price decisions in the light of the national interest and their own self-interest¡Xthen for the worker, the farmer, the consumer, for Americans everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity: more jobs, more income, more profits, without inflation and without war."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"This is a great goal, and once that we can achieve together."
1971,Nixon,Republican,The third great goal is to continue the effort so dramatically begun last year: to restore and enhance our natural environment.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Building on the foundation laid in the 37-point program that I submitted to Congress last year, I will propose a strong new set of initiatives to clean up our air and water, to combat noise, and to preserve and restore our surroundings."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"I will propose programs to make better use of our land, to encourage a balanced national growth¡Xgrowth that will revitalize our rural heartland and enhance the quality of life in America."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"And not only to meet today¡¦s needs but to anticipate those of tomorrow, I will put forward the most extensive program ever proposed by a President of the United States to expand the Nation¡¦s parks, recreation areas, open spaces, in a way that truly brings parks to the people where the people are."
1971,Nixon,Republican,For only if we leave a legacy of parks will the next generation have parks to enjoy.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As a fourth great goal, I will offer a far-reaching set of proposals for improving America¡¦s health care and making it available more fairly to more people."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"I will propose: --A Program to insure that no American family will be prevented from obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay. --I will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical schools, to greatly increase the number of doctors and other health personnel. --Incentives to improve the delivery of health services, to get more medical care resources into those areas that have not been adequately served, to make greater use of medical assistants, and to slow the alarming rise in the costs of medical care. --New programs to encourage better preventive medicine, by attacking the causes of disease and injury, and by providing incentives to doctors to keep people well rather than just to treat them when they are sick."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100 million to launch an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer, and I will ask later for whatever additional funds can effectively be used."
1971,Nixon,Republican,The time has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this dread disease.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.
1971,Nixon,Republican,America has long been the wealthiest nation in the world.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Now it is time we became the healthiest nation in the world.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The fifth great goal is to strengthen and to renew our State and local governments.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976, we remember that this Nation launched itself as a loose confederation of separate States, without a workable central government."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"At that time, the mark of its leaders¡¦ vision was that they quickly saw the need to balance the separate powers of the States with a government of central powers."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"And so they gave us a constitution of balanced powers, of unity with diversity¡Xand so clear was their vision that it survives today as the oldest written constitution still in force in the world."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"For almost two centuries since¡Xand dramatically in the 1990¡¦s¡Xat those great turning points when the question has been between the States and the Federal Government, that question has been resolved in favor of a stronger central Federal Government."
1971,Nixon,Republican,During this time the Nation grew and the Nation prospered.
1971,Nixon,Republican,But one thing history tells us is that no great movement goes in the same direction forever.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Nations change, they adapt, or they slowly die."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The time has now come in America to reverse the flow of power and resources from the States and communities to Washington, and start power and resources flowing back from Washington to the States and communities and, more important, to the people all across America."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The time has come for a new partnership between the Federal Government and the States and localities¡Xa partnership in which we entrust the States and localities with a large share of the Nation¡¦s responsibilities, and in which we share our Federal revenues with them so that they can meet those responsibilities."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"To achieve this goal, I propose to the Congress tonight that we enact a plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"All across America today, States and cities are confronted with a financial crisis."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Some have already been cutting back on essential services¡Xfor example, just recently San Diego and Cleveland cut back on trash collections."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Most are caught between the prospects of bankruptcy on the one hand and adding to an already crushing tax burden on the other.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As one indication of the rising costs of local government, I discovered the other day that my home town of Whittier, California¡Xwhich has a population of 67,000¡Xhas a larger budget for 1971 than the entire Federal budget was in 1791."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Now the time has come to take a new direction, and once again to introduce a new and more creative balance to our approach to government."
1971,Nixon,Republican,So let us put the money where the needs are.
1971,Nixon,Republican,And let us put the power to spend it where the people are.
1971,Nixon,Republican,I propose that the Congress make a $16 billion investment in renewing State and local government.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Five billion dollars of this will be in new and unrestricted funds to be used as the States and localities see fit.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The other $11 billion will be provided by allocating $1 billion of new funds and converting one-third of the money going to the present narrow-purpose aid programs into Federal revenue sharing funds for six broad purposes¡Xfor urban development, rural development, education, transportation, job training, and law enforcement¡Xbut with the States and localities making their own decisions on how it should be spent within each category."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"For the next fiscal year, this would increase total Federal aid to the States and localities more than 25 percent over the present level."
1971,Nixon,Republican,The revenue sharing proposals I send to the Congress will include the safeguards against discrimination that accompany all other Federal funds allocated to the States.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Neither the President nor the Congress nor the conscience of this Nation can permit money which comes from all the people to be used in a way which discriminates against some of the people.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The Federal Government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieving our national progress.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Established functions that are clearly and essentially Federal in nature will still be performed by the Federal Government.
1971,Nixon,Republican,New functions that need to be sponsored or performed by the Federal government¡Xsuch as those I have urged tonight in welfare and health¡Xwill be added to the Federal agenda.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Whenever it makes the best sense for us to act as a whole nation, the Federal Government should and will lead the way."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"But where States or local governments can better do what needs to be done, let us see that they have the resources to do it there."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Under this plan, the Federal Government will provide the States and localities with more money and less interference¡Xand by cutting down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot further."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us share our resources.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us share them to rescue the States and localities from the brink of financial crisis.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us share them to give homeowners and wage earners a chance to escape from ever-higher property taxes and sales taxes.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us share our resources for two other reasons as well.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The first of these reasons has to do with government itself, and the second has to do with each of us, with the individual."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let¡¦s face it.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at all levels.
1971,Nixon,Republican,They will not¡Xand they should not¡Xcontinue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The fact is that we have made the Federal Government so strong it grows musclebound and the States and localities so weak they approach impotence.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"If we put more power in more places, we can make government more creative in more places."
1971,Nixon,Republican,That way we multiply the number of people with the ability to make things happen¡Xand we can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout America.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The final reason I urge this historic shift is much more personal, for each and for every one of us."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As everything seems to have grown bigger and more complex in America, as the forces that shape our lives seem to have grown more distant and more impersonal, a great feeling of frustration has crept across this land."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Whether it is the workingman who feels neglected, the black man who feels oppressed, or the mother concerned about her children, there has been a growing feeling the ¡§Things are in the saddle, and ride mankind.¡¨ Millions of frustrated young Americans today are crying out¡Xasking not what will government do for me, but what can I do, how can I contribute, how can I matter?"
1971,Nixon,Republican,And so let us answer them.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Let us say to them and let us say to all Americans, ¡§We hear you."
1971,Nixon,Republican,We will give you a chance.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"We are going to give you a new chance to have more to say about the decisions that affect your future¡Xa chance to participate in government¡Xbecause we are going to provide more centers of power where what you do can make a difference that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole community.¡¨ The further away government is from people, the stronger government becomes and the weaker people become."
1971,Nixon,Republican,And a nation with a strong government and a weak people is an empty shell.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"I reject the patronizing idea that government in Washington, D.C., is inevitably more wise, more honest, and more efficient than government at the local or State level."
1971,Nixon,Republican,The honesty and efficiency of government depends on people.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Government at all level has good people and bad people.
1971,Nixon,Republican,And the way to get more good people into government is to give them more opportunity to do good things.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is best for people everywhere and that you cannot trust local governments is really a contention that you cannot trust people to govern themselves.
1971,Nixon,Republican,This notion is completely foreign to the American experience.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Local government is the government closest to the people, it is most responsive to the individual person."
1971,Nixon,Republican,It is people¡¦s government in a far more intimate way than the Government in Washington can ever be.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"People came to America because they wanted to determine their own future rather than to live in a country where others determined their future for them. more people a chance to do something, we can have government that truly is by the people."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"And by setting up a completely modern, functional system of government at the national level, we in Washington will at last be able to provide government that is truly for the people."
1971,Nixon,Republican,I realize that what I am asking is that not only the executive branch in Washington but that even this Congress will have to change by giving up some of its power.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Change is hard.
1971,Nixon,Republican,But without change there can be no progress.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"And for each of us the question then becomes, not ¡§Will change cause me inconvenience?¡¨ but ¡§Will change bring progress for America?¡¨ Giving up power is hard."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"But I would urge all of you, as leaders of this country, to remember that the truly revered leaders in world history are those who gave power to people, and not those who took it away."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As we consider these reforms we will be acting, not for the next 2 years or for the next 10 years, but for the next 100 years."
1971,Nixon,Republican,So let us approach these six great goals with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history itself.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of those great Americans who met in Philadelphia almost190 years ago to write a constitution.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Let us leave a heritage as they did¡Xnot just for our children but for millions yet unborn¡Xof a nation where every American will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where he knows not only his votes but his ideas count¡Xa system of government which will provide the means for America to reach heights of achievement undreamed of before.
1971,Nixon,Republican,Those men who met at Philadelphia left a great heritage because they had a vision¡Xnot only of what the Nation was but of what it could become.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"As I think of that vision, I recall that America was founded as the land of the open door¡Xas a haven for the oppressed, a land of opportunity, a place of refuge, of hope."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"When the first settlers opened the door of America three and a half centuries ago, they came to escape persecution and to find opportunity¡Xand they left wide the door of welcome for others to follow."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"When the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence almost two centuries ago, they opened the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillment¡Xnot just for an elite but for all."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"To the generations that followed, America¡¦s was the open door that beckoned millions from the old world to the new in search of a better life, a freer life, a fuller life, and in which, but their own decisions, they could shape their own destinies."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"For the black American, the Indian, the Mexican-American, and for those others in our land who have not had an equal chance, the Nation at last has begun to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity, and of human dignity."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"For all Americans, with these changes I have proposed tonight we can open the door to a new era of opportunity."
1971,Nixon,Republican,We can open the door to full and effective participation in the decisions that affect their lives.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"We can open the door to a new partnership among governments at all levels, between those governments and the people themselves."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"And by so doing, we can open wide the doors of human fulfillment for millions of people here in America now and in the years to come."
1971,Nixon,Republican,In the next few weeks I will spell out in greater detail the way I propose that we achieve these six great goals.
1971,Nixon,Republican,I ask this Congress to be responsive.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"If it is, then the 92d Congress, your Congress, our Congress, at the end of its term, will be able to look back on a record more splendid than any in our history."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"This can be the Congress that helped us end the longest war in the Nation¡¦s history, and end it in a way that will give us at last a genuine chance to enjoy what we have not had in this century: a full generation of peace."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"This can be the Congress that helped achieve an expanding economy, with full employment and without inflation¡Xand without the deadly stimulus of war."
1971,Nixon,Republican,This can be the Congress that reformed a welfare system that has robbed recipients of their dignity and robbed States and cities of their resources.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"This can be the Congress that pressed forward the rescue of our environment, and established for the next generation an enduring legacy of parks for the people."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"This can be the Congress that launched a new era in American medicine, in which the quality of medical care was enhanced while the costs were made less burdensome."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"But above all, what this Congress can be remembered for is opening the way to a new American revolution¡Xa peaceful revolution in which power was turned back to the people¡Xin which government at all levels was refreshed and renewed and made truly responsive."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"This can be a revolution as profound, as far-reaching, as exciting as that first revolution almost 200 year ago¡Xand it can mean that just 5 years from now America will enter its third century as a young nation new in spirit, with all the vigor and the freshness with which it began its first century."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"My colleagues in the Congress, these are great goals."
1971,Nixon,Republican,They can make the sessions of this Congress a great moment for America.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"So let us pledge together to go forward together¡Xby achieving these goals to give America the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the years to come, and in so doing to make this the greatest Congress in the history of this great and good country."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Note: The President delivered his address at 9 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol before a joint session of the Congress.
1971,Nixon,Republican,He was introduced by Speaker of the House of Representatives Carl Albert of Oklahoma.
1971,Nixon,Republican,The address was broadcast live on radio and television.
1971,Nixon,Republican,An advance text of the President¡¦s address was released on the same day.
1971,Nixon,Republican,"The White House also released the transcripts of three news briefings on the President¡¦s State of the Union proposals: the first, on January 25, 1971, by Senator Hugh Scott and Representative Gerald R."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Ford following a Republican Congressional leadership meeting with the President; the second, on January 27, by John D."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Khrlichman, Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs; and the their, on February 2, by Secretary of Commence Maurice H."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Stans, Secretary of Labor James D."
1971,Nixon,Republican,"Hedgson, nad Secretary of Agriculture Clifford M."
1971,Nixon,Republican,Hardin following a meeting of the Cabinet.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Address on the State of the Union Delivered Before a Joint Session of the Congress.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"January 20, 1972 Mr."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"President, my colleagues in the Congress, our distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: ¡@Twenty-five years ago I sat here as a freshman Congressman¡Xalong with Speaker Albert¡Xand listened for the first time to the President address the State of the Union."
1972,Nixon,Republican,I shall never forget that moment.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The Senate, the diplomatic corps, the Supreme Court, the Cabinet entered the Chamber, and then the President of the United States."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As all of you are aware, I had some differences with President Truman."
1972,Nixon,Republican,He had some with me.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But I remember that on that day¡Xthe day he addressed that joint session of the newly elected Republican 80th Congress, he spoke not as a partisan, but as President of all the people¡Xcalling upon the Congress to put aside partisan considerations in the national interest."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The Greek-Turkish aid program, the Marshall Plan, the great foreign policy initiatives which have been responsible for avoiding a world war for over 25 years were approved by the 80th Congress, by a bipartisan majority of which I was proud to be a part. ¡@Nineteen hundred seventy-two is now before us."
1972,Nixon,Republican,It holds precious time in which to accomplish good for the Nation.
1972,Nixon,Republican,We must not waste it.
1972,Nixon,Republican,I know the political pressures in this session of the Congress will be great.
1972,Nixon,Republican,There are more candidates for the Presidency in this Chamber today than there probably have been at any one time in the whole history of the Republic.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"And there is an honest difference of opinion, not only between the parties, but within each party, on some foreign policy issues and on some domestic policy issues."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"However, there are great national problems that are so vital that they transcend partisanship."
1972,Nixon,Republican,So let us have our debates.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Let us have our honest differences.
1972,Nixon,Republican,But let us join in keeping the national interest first.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Let us join in making sure that legislation the Nation needs does not become hostage to the political interests of any party or any person.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"There is ample precedent, in this election year, for me to present you with a huge list of new proposals, knowing full well that there would not be any possibility of your passing them if you worked night and day."
1972,Nixon,Republican,I shall not do that.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"I have presented to the leaders of the Congress today a message of 15,000 words discussing in some detail where the Nation stands and setting forth specific legislative items on which I have asked the Congress to act."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Much of this is legislation which I proposed in 1969, in 1970, and also in the first session of this 92d congress and on which I feel it is essential that action be completed this year."
1972,Nixon,Republican,I am not presenting proposals which have attractive labels but no hope of passage.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"I am presenting only vital programs which are within the capacity of this Congress to enact, within the capacity of the budget to finance, and which I believe should be above partisanship¡Xprograms which deal with urgent priorities for the Nation, which should and must be the subject of bipartisan action by this Congress in the interests of the country in 1972."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"When I took the oath of office on the steps of this building just 3 years ago today, the Nation was ending one of the most tortured decades in its history."
1972,Nixon,Republican,The 1960¡¦s were a time of great progress in many areas.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But as we all know, they were also times of great agony¡Xthe agonies of war, of inflation, of rapidly rising crime, of deteriorating cities, of hopes raised and disappointed, and of anger and frustration that led finally to violence and to the worst civil disorder in a century."
1972,Nixon,Republican,I recall these troubles not to point any fingers of blame.
1972,Nixon,Republican,The Nation was so torn in those final years of the sixties that many in both parties questioned whether America could be governed at all.
1972,Nixon,Republican,The Nation has made significant progress in these first years of the seventies: Our colleges and universities have again become places of learning instead of battlegrounds.
1972,Nixon,Republican,A beginning has been made in preserving and protecting our environment.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The rate of increase in crime has been slowed¡Xand here in the District of Columbia, the one city where the Federal Government has direct jurisdiction, serious crime in 1971 was actually reduced by 13 percent from that year before."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Most important, because of the beginnings that have been made, we can say today that this year 1972 can be the year in which America may make the greatest progress in 25 years toward achieving our goal of being at peace with all the nations of the world."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As our involvement in the war in Vietnam comes to an end, we must now go on to build a generation of peace."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"To achieve that goal, we must first face realistically the need to maintain our defense."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"In the past 3 years, we have reduced the burden of arms."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"For the first time in 20 years, spending on defense has been brought below spending on human resources."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As we look to the future, we find encouraging progress in our negotiations with the Soviet Union on limitation of strategic arms."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"And looking further into the future, we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arms."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But until there is such a mutual agreement, we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"And that is why, because of rising research and development costs, because of increases in military and civilian pay, because of the need to proceed with new weapons systems, my budget for the coming fiscal year will provide for an increase in defense spending."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Strong military defenses are not the enemy of peace; they are the guardians of peace.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"There could be no more misguided set of priorities than one which would tempt others by weakening America, and thereby endanger the peace of the world."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"In our foreign policy, we have entered a new era."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The world has changed greatly in the 11 years since President John Kennedy said in his Inaugural Address, ¡§¡Kwe shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.¡¨ Our policy has been carefully and deliberately adjusted to meet the new realities of the new world we live in."
1972,Nixon,Republican,We make today only those commitments we are able and prepared to meet.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Our commitment to freedom remains strong and unshakable.
1972,Nixon,Republican,But others must bear their share of the burden of defending freedom around the world.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"And so this, then, is our policy: --We will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the United States or of our allies. --We will help other nations develop the capability of defending themselves. --We will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitments. --We will act to defend our interests, whenever and wherever they are threatened anyplace in the world. --But where our interests or our treaty commitments are not involved, our role will be limited. --We will not intervene militarily. --But we will use our influence to prevent war. --If war comes, we will use our influence to stop it. --Once it is over, will do your share in helping to bind up the wounds of those who have participated in it. ¡@As you know, I will soon be visiting the People¡¦s Republic of China and the Soviet Union."
1972,Nixon,Republican,I go there with no illusions.
1972,Nixon,Republican,We have great differences with both powers.
1972,Nixon,Republican,We shall continue to have great differences.
1972,Nixon,Republican,But peace depends on the ability of great powers to live together on the same planet despite their differences.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We would not be true to our obligation to generations yet unborn if we failed to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we will be able to talk about those differences, rather than to fight about them, in the future."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As we look back over this century, let us, in the highest spirit of bipartisanship, recognize that we can be proud of our Nation¡¦s record in foreign affairs."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"America has given more generously of itself toward maintaining freedom, preserving peace, alleviating human suffering around the globe, than any nation has ever done in the history of man."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We have fought four wars in this century, but our power has never been used to break the peace, only to keep it; never been used to destroy freedom, only to defend it; never been used to destroy freedom, only to defend it."
1972,Nixon,Republican,We now have within our reach the goal of insuring that the next generation can be the first generation in this century to be spared the scourges of war.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Turning to our problems at home, we are making progress toward our goal of a new prosperity without war."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Industrial production, consumer spending, retail sales, personal income all have been rising."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Total employment, real income are the highest in history."
1972,Nixon,Republican,New homebuilding starts this past year reached the highest level ever.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Business and consumer confidence have both been rising.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Interest rates are down.
1972,Nixon,Republican,The rate of inflation is down.
1972,Nixon,Republican,We can look with confidence to 1972 as the year when the back of inflation will be broken.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Now, this a good record, but it is not good enough¡Xnot when we still have an unemployment rate of 6 percent."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"It is not enough to point out that this was the rate of the early peacetime years of the sixties, or that if the more than 2 million men released from the Armed Forces and defense-related industries were still in their wartime jobs, unemployment would be far lower."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Our goal in this country is full employment in peacetime.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We intend to meet that goal, and we can."
1972,Nixon,Republican,The Congress has helped to meet that goal by passing our job-creating tax program last month.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The historic monetary agreements, agreements that we have reached with the major European nations, Canada, and Japan, will help meet it by providing new markets for American products, new jobs for American workers."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Our budget will help meet it by being expansionary without being inflationary¡Xa job-producing budget that will help take up the gap as the economy expands to full employment.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Our program to raise farm income will help meet it by helping to revitalize rural America, by giving to America¡¦s farmers their fair share of America¡¦s increasing productivity."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set of major initiatives to stimulate more imaginative use of America¡¦s great capacity for technological advance, and to direct it toward improving the quality of life for every American."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"In reaching the moon, we demonstrated what miracles American technology is capable of achieving."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Now the time has come to move more deliberately toward making full use of that technology here on earth, of harnessing the wonders of science to the service of man."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"I shall soon send to the Congress a special message proposing a new program of Federal partnership in technological research and developments¡Xwith Federal incentives to increase private research, federally supported research on projects designed to improve our everyday lives in ways that will range from improving mass transit to developing new systems of emergency health care that could save thousands of lives annually. ¡@Historically, our superior technology and high productivity have made it possible for American workers to be the highest paid in the world by far, and yet for our goods still to compete in world markets."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Now we face a new situation.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As other nations move rapidly forward in technology, the answer to the new competition is not to build a wall around America, but rather to remain competitive by improving our own technology still further and by increasing productivity in American industry."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Our new monetary and trade agreements will make it possible for American goods to compete fairly in the world¡¦s markets¡Xbut they still must compete.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The new technology program will put to use the skills of many highly trained Americans, skills that might otherwise be wasted."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"It will also meet the growing technological challenge from abroad, and it will thus help to create new industries, as well as creating more jobs for America¡¦s workers in producing for the world¡¦s markets."
1972,Nixon,Republican,This second session of the 92d congress already has before it more than 90 major Administration proposals which still await action.
1972,Nixon,Republican,I have discussed these in the extensive written message that I have presented to the Congress today.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They include, among others, our programs to improve life for the aging; to combat crime and drug abuse; to improve health services and to ensure that no one will be denied needed health care because of inability to pay; to protect workers¡¦ pension rights; to promote equal opportunity for members of minorities, and others who have been left behind; to expand consumer protection; to improve the environment; to revitalize rural America; to help the cities; to launch new initiatives in education; to improve transportation, and to put and end to costly labor tie-ups in transportation."
1972,Nixon,Republican,The west coast dock strike is a case in point.
1972,Nixon,Republican,This Nation cannot and will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie-up in the future.
1972,Nixon,Republican,The messages also include basic reforms which are essential if our structure of government is to be adequate in the decades ahead.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare system¡Xsubstitution of a new system that provides work requirements and work incentives for those who can help themselves, income support for those who cannot help themselves, and fairness to the working poor."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They include a $17 billion program of Federal revenue sharing with the States and localities as an investment in their renewal, an investment also of faith in the American people."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the Federal Government so that it will be more efficient, more responsive, and able to meet the challenges of the decades ahead."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"One year ago, standing in this place, I laid before the opening session of this Congress six great goals."
1972,Nixon,Republican,One of these was welfare reform.
1972,Nixon,Republican,That proposal has been before the Congress now for nearly 2 1/2 years.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"My proposals on revenue sharing, government reorganization, health care, and the environment have now been before the Congress for nearly a year."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Many of the other major proposals that I have referred to have been here that long or longer.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Now, 1971, we can say, was a year of consideration of these measures."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Now let us join in making 1972 a year of action on them, action by the Congress, for the Nation and for the people of America."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Now, in addition, there is one pressing need which I have not previously covered, but which must be placed on the national agenda."
1972,Nixon,Republican,We long have looked in this Nation to the local property tax as the main source of financing for public primary and secondary education.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As a result, soaring school costs, soaring property tax rates now threaten both our communities and our schools."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They threaten communities because property taxes, which more than doubled in the 10 years from 1960 to 70, have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxes, hitting most cruelly at the elderly and the retired; and they threaten schools, as hard-pressed voters understandably reject new bond issues at the polls."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The problem has been given even greater urgency by four recent court decisions, which have held that the conventional method of financing schools through local property taxes is discriminatory and unconstitutional."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Nearly 2 years ago, I named a special Presidential commission to study the problems of school finance, and I also directed the Federal departments to look into the same problems."
1972,Nixon,Republican,We are developing comprehensive proposals to meet these problems.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"This issue involves two complex and interrelated sets of problems: support of the schools and the basic relationships of Federal, State, and local governments in any tax reforms."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Under the leadership of the Secretary of the Treasury, we are carefully reviewing all of the tax aspects, and I have this week enlisted the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations in addressing the intergovernmental relations aspects."
1972,Nixon,Republican,I have asked this bipartisan Commission to review our proposals for Federal action to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property taxes.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Later in the year, when both Commissions have completed their studies, I shall make my final recommendations for relieving the burden of property taxes and providing both fair and adequate financing for our children¡¦s education."
1972,Nixon,Republican,These recommendations will be revolutionary.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But all these recommendations, however, will be rooted in one fundamental principle with which there can be no compromise: Local school boards must have control over local schools."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As we look ahead over the coming decades, vast new growth and change are not only certainties, they will be the dominant reality of this world, and particularly of our life in America."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Surveying the certainty of rapid change, we can be like a fallen rider caught in the stirrups¡Xor we can sit high in the saddle, the masters of change, directing it on a course we choose."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The secret of mastering change in today¡¦s world is to reach back to old and proven principles, and to adapt them with imagination and intelligence to the new realities of a new age."
1972,Nixon,Republican,That is what we have done in the proposals that I have laid before the Congress.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They are rooted in basic principles that are as enduring as human nature, as robust as the American experience; and they are responsive to new conditions."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Thus they represent a spirit of change that is truly renewal.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As we look back at those old principles, we find them as timely as they are timeless."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We believe in independence, and self-reliance, and the creative value of the competitive spirit."
1972,Nixon,Republican,We believe in full and equal opportunity for all Americans and in the protection of individual rights and liberties.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We believe in the family as the keystone of the community, and in the community as the keystone of the Nation."
1972,Nixon,Republican,We believe in compassion toward those in need.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We believe in a system of law, justice, and order as the basis of a genuinely free society."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We believe that a person should get what he works for¡Xand that those who can, should work for¡Xand that those who can, should work for what they get."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We believe in the capacity of people to make their own decisions in their own lives, in their own communities¡Xand we believe in their right to make those decisions."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"In applying these principles, we have done so with the full understanding that what we seek in the seventies, what our quest is, is not merely for more, but for better¡Xfor a better quality of life for all Americans."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Thus, for example, we are giving a new measure of attention to cleaning up our air and water, making our surroundings more attractive."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"We are providing broader support for the arts, helping stimulate a deeper appreciation of what they can contribute to the Nation¡¦s activities and to our individual lives."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But nothing really matters more to the quality of our lives than the way we treat one another, than our capacity to live respectfully together as a unified society, with a full, generous regard for the rights of others and also for the feelings of others."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent years, as we learn once again to speak with one another instead of shouting at one another, we are regaining that capacity."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"As is customary here, on this occasion, I have been talking about programs."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Programs are important.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But even more important than programs is what we are as a Nation¡Xwhat we mean as a Nation, to ourselves and to the world."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"In New York Harbor stands one of the most famous statues in the world¡Xthe Statue of Liberty, the gift in 1886 of the people of France to the people of the United States."
1972,Nixon,Republican,This statue is more than a landmark; it is a symbol¡Xa symbol of what America has meant to the world.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"It reminds us that what America has meant is not its wealth, and not its power, but its spirit and purpose¡Xa land that enshrines liberty and opportunity, and that has held out a hand of welcome to millions in search of a better and a fuller and, above all, a freer life."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The world¡¦s hopes poured into America, along with its people."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"And those hopes, those dreams, that have been brought here from every corner of the world, have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Four years from now, America will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding as a Nation."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"There are those who say that the old Spirit of ¡¦76 is dead¡Xthat we no longer have the strength of character, the idealism, the faith in our founding purposes that that spirit represents."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Those who say this do not know America.
1972,Nixon,Republican,We have been undergoing self-doubts and self-criticism.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But these are only the other side of our growing sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty, of our impatience with the slowness with which age-old ills are being overcome."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"If we were indifferent to the shortcomings of our society, or complacent about our institutions, or blind to the lingering inequities¡Xthen we would have lost our way."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"But the fact that we have those concerns is evidence that our ideals, deep down, are still strong."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Indeed, they remind us that what is really best about America is its compassion."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"They remind us that in the final analysis, America is great not because it is rich, but because this is a good country."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Let us reject the narrow visions of those who would tell us that we are evil because we are not yet perfect, that we are corrupt because we are not yet pure, that all the sweat and trial and sacrifice that have gone into the building of America were for naught because the building is not yet done."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Let us see that the path we are traveling is wide, with room in it for all of us, and that its direction is toward a better Nation and a more peaceful world."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Never has it mattered more that we go forward together.
1972,Nixon,Republican,Look at this Chamber.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"The leadership of America is here today¡Xthe Supreme Court, the Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Together, we hold the future of the Nation, and the conscience of the Nation in our hands."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"Because this year is an election year, it will be a time of great pressure."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"If we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic challenges that we face, we will have failed that trust of millions of Americans and shaken the confidence they have a right to place in us, in their Government."
1972,Nixon,Republican,Never has a Congress had a greater opportunity to leave a legacy of a profound and constructive reform for the Nation than this Congress.
1972,Nixon,Republican,"If we succeed in these tasks, there will be credit enough for all¡Xnot only for doing what is right, but doing it in the right way, by rising above partisan interest to serve the national interest."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"And if we fail, more than any one of us, America will be the loser."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"That is why my call upon the Congress today is for a high statesmanship, so that in the years to come Americans will look back and say because it withstood the intense pressures of a political year, and achieved such great good for the American people and for the future of this Nation, this was truly a great Congress."
1972,Nixon,Republican,"NOTE: The President spoke at 12:34 p.m. in the House Chamber at the Capitol, after being introduced by Carl Albert, Speaker of the House of Representatives."
1972,Nixon,Republican,The address was broadcast live on radio and television.
1972,Nixon,Republican,The President spoke from a prepared text.
1972,Nixon,Republican,An advance text of his address was released on the same day.
1973,Nixon,Republican,State of the Union Message to the Congress: Overview and Goals.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"February 2, 1973 To the congress of the United States: The traditional form of the President¡¦s annual report giving ¡§to the Congress Information of the State of the Union¡¨ is a single message or address."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"As the affairs and concerns of our Union have multiplied over the years, however, so too have the subjects that require discussion in State of the Union Messages."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"This year in particular, with so many changes in Government programs under consideration¡Xand with our very philosophy about the relationship between the individual and the State at an historic crossroads¡Xa single, all-embracing State of the Union Message would not appear to be adequate."
1973,Nixon,Republican,I have therefore decided to present my 1973 State of the Union report in the form of a series of messages during these early weeks of the 93rd Congress.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"The purpose of this first message in the series is to give a concise overview of where we stand as a people today, and to outline some of the general goals that I believe we should pursue over the next year and beyond."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"In coming weeks, I will send to the Congress further State of the Union reports on specific areas of policy including economic affairs, natural resources, human resources, community development and foreign and defense policy."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"The new course these messages will outline represents a fresh approach to Government: an approach that addresses the realities of the 1970s, not those of the 1930s or of the 1960s."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"The role of the Federal Government as we approach our third century of independence should not be to dominate any facet of American life, but rather to aid and encourage people, communities and institutions to deal with as many of the difficulties and challenges facing them as possible, and to help see to it that every American has a full and equal opportunity to realize his or her potential."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"If we were to continue to expand the Federal Government at the rate of the past several decades, it soon would consume us entirely."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"The time has come when we must make clear choices¡Xchoices between old programs that set worthy goals but failed to reach them and new programs that provide a better way to realize those goals; and choices, too, between competing programs¡Xall of which may be desirable in themselves but only some of which we can afford with the finite resources at our command."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Because our resources are not infinite, we also face a critical choice in 1973 between holding the line in Government spending and adopting expensive programs which will surely force up taxes and refuel inflation."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Finally, it is vital at this time that we restore a greater sense of responsibility at the State and local level, and among individual Americans."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"WHERE WE STAND The basic state of our Union today is sound, and full of promise."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"We enter 1973 economically strong, militarily secure and, most important of all, at peace after a long and trying war."
1973,Nixon,Republican,America continues to provide a better and more abundant life for more of its people than any other nation in the world.
1973,Nixon,Republican,We have passed through one of the most difficult periods in our history without surrendering to despair and without dishonoring our ideals as a people.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Looking back, there is a lesson in all this for all of us."
1973,Nixon,Republican,The lesson is one that we sometimes had to learn the hard way over the past few years.
1973,Nixon,Republican,But we did learn it.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"That lesson is that even potentially destructive forces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel them, and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climate of mutual respect and goodwill."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"By working together and harnessing the forces of nature, Americans have unlocked some of the great mysteries of the universe."
1973,Nixon,Republican,Men have walked the surface of the moon and soared to new heights of discovery.
1973,Nixon,Republican,This same spirit of discovery is helping us to conquer disease and suffering that have plagued our own planet since the dawn of time.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"By working together with the leaders of other nations, we have been able to build a new hope for lasting peace¡Xfor a structure of world order in which common interest outweighs old animosities, and in which a new generation of the human family can grow up at peace in a changing world."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"At home, we have learned that by working together we can create prosperity without fanning inflation; we can restore order without weakening freedom."
1973,Nixon,Republican,THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ¡@These first years of the 1970s have been good years for America.
1973,Nixon,Republican,Our job¡Xall of us together¡Xis to make 1973 and the years to come even better ones.
1973,Nixon,Republican,I believe that we can.
1973,Nixon,Republican,I believe that we can make the years leading to our Bicentennial the best four years in American history.
1973,Nixon,Republican,But we must never forget that nothing worthwhile can be achieved without the will to succeed and the strength to sacrifice.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Hard decisions must be made, and we must stick by them."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"In the field of foreign policy, we must remember that a strong America¡Xan America whose word is believed and whose strength is respected¡Xis essential to continued peace and understanding in the world."
1973,Nixon,Republican,The peace with honor we have achieved in Vietnam has strengthened this basic American credibility.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"We must act in such a way in coming years that this credibility will remain intact, and with it, the world stability of which it is so indispensable a part."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"At home, we must reject the mistaken notion¡Xa notion that has dominated too much of the public dialogue for too long¡Xthat ever bigger Government is the answer to every problem."
1973,Nixon,Republican,We have learned only too well that heavy taxation and excessive Government spending are not a cure-all.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"In too many cases, instead of solving the problems they were aimed at, they have merely placed an ever heavier burden on the shoulders of the American taxpayer, in the form of higher taxes and a higher cost of living."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"At the same time they have deceived our people because many of the intended beneficiaries received far less than was promised, thus undermining public faith in the effectiveness of Government as a whole."
1973,Nixon,Republican,The time has come for us to draw the line.
1973,Nixon,Republican,The time has come for the responsible leaders of both political parties to take a stand against overgrown Government and for the American taxpayer.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"We are not, spending the Federal Government¡¦s money, we are spending the taxpayer¡¦s money, and it must be spent in a way which guarantees his money¡¦s worth and yields the fullest possible benefit to the people being helped."
1973,Nixon,Republican,The answer to many of the domestic problems we face is not higher taxes and more spending.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"It is less waste, more results and greater freedom for the individual American to earn a rightful place in his own community¡Xand for States and localities to address their own needs in their own ways, in the light of their own priorities."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"By giving the people and their locally elected leaders a greater voice through changes such as revenue sharing, and by saying ¡§no¡¨ to excessive Federal spending and higher taxes, we can help achieve this goal."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"COMING MESSAGES ¡@The policies which I will outline to the Congress in the weeks ahead represent a reaffirmation, not an abdication, of Federal responsibility."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"They represent a pragmatic rededication to social compassion and national excellence, in place of the combination of good intentions and fuzzy follow-through which too often in the past was thought sufficient."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"In the field of economic affairs, our objectives will be to hold down taxes, to continue controlling inflation, to promote economic growth, to increase productivity, to encourage foreign trade, to keep farm income high, to bolster small business, and to promote better labor-management relations."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"In the area of natural resources, my recommendations will include programs to preserve and enhance the environment, to advance science and technology, and to assure balanced use of our irreplaceable natural resources."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"In developing human resources, I will have recommendations to advance the Nation¡¦s health and education, to improve conditions of people in need, to carry forward our increasingly successful attacks on crime, drug abuse and injustice, and to deal with such important areas of special concern as consumer affairs."
1973,Nixon,Republican,We will continue and improve our Nation¡¦s efforts to assist those who have served in the Armed Services in Vietnam through better job and training opportunities.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"We must do a better job in community development¡Xin creating more livable communities, in which all of our children can grow up with fuller access to opportunity and greater immunity to the social evils and blights which now plague so many of our towns and cities."
1973,Nixon,Republican,I shall have proposals to help us achieve this.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"I shall also deal with our defense and foreign policies, and with our new approaches to the role and structure of Government itself."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Considered as a whole, this series of messages will be a blueprint for modernizing the concept and the functions of American Government to meet the needs of our people."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Converting it into reality will require a spirit of cooperation and shared commitment on the part of all branches of the Government, for the goals we seek are not those of any single party or faction, they are goals for the betterment of all Americans."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"As President, I recognize that I cannot do this job alone."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"The Congress must help, and I pledge to do my part to achieve a constructive working relationship with the Congress."
1973,Nixon,Republican,My sincere hope is that the executive and legislative branches can work together in this great undertaking in a positive spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"Working together¡Xthe Congress, the President and the people¡XI am confident that we can translate these proposals into an action program that can reform and revitalize American Government and, even more important, build a better life for all Americans."
1973,Nixon,Republican,"RICHARD NIXON The White House, February 2, 1973."
1973,Nixon,Republican,NOTE: The message was the first in a series of six messages to the Congress on the state of the Union.
1973,Nixon,Republican,"The other messages are printed as Items 44, 53, 61, 73, and 79."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Address on the State of the Union Delivered Before a Joint Session of the Congress.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"January 30, 1974 Mr."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"President, my colleagues in the Congress, our distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: We meet here tonight at a time of great challenge and great opportunities for America."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We meet at a time when we face great problems at home and abroad that will test the strength of our fiber as a nation.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"But we also meet at a time when that fiber has been tested, and it has proved strong."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"America is a great and good land, and we are a great and good land because we are a strong, free, creative people and because America is the single greatest force for peace anywhere in the world."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Today, as always in our history, we can base our confidence in what the American people will achieve in the future on the record of what the American people have achieved in the past."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Tonight, for the first time in 12 years, a President of the United States can report to the Congress on the state of a Union at peace with every nation of the world."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Because of this, in the 22,000-word message on the state of the Union that I have just handed to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, I have been able to deal primarily with the problems of peace¡Xwith what we can do here at home in America for the American people¡Xrather than with the problems of war."
1974,Nixon,Republican,The measures I have outlined in this message set an agenda for truly significant progress for this Nation and the world in 1974.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Before we chart where we are going, let us see how far we have come."
1974,Nixon,Republican,It was 5 years ago on the steps of this Capitol that I took the oath of office as your President.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In those 5 years, because of the initiatives undertaken by this Administration, the world has changed."
1974,Nixon,Republican,America has changed.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As a result of those changes, America is safer today, more prosperous today, with greater opportunity for more of its people than ever before in our history."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Five years ago, America was at war in Southeast Asia."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We were locked in confrontation with the Soviet Union.
1974,Nixon,Republican,We were in hostile isolation from a quarter of the world¡¦s people who lived in Mainland China.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Five years ago, our cities were burning and besieged."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Five years ago, our college campuses were a battleground."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Five years ago, crime was increasing at a rate that struck fear across the Nation."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Five years ago, the spiraling rise in drug addiction was threatening human and social tragedy of massive proportion, and there was no program to deal with it."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Five years ago¡Xas young Americans had done for a generation before that¡XAmerica¡¦s youth still lived under the shadow of the military draft.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Five years ago, there was no national program to preserve our environment."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Day by day, our air was getting dirtier, our water was getting more foul."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And 5 years ago, American agriculture was practically a depressed industry with 100,000 farm families abandoning the farm every year."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As we look at America today, we find ourselves challenged by new problems."
1974,Nixon,Republican,But we also find a record of progress to confound the professional criers of doom and prophets of despair.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"We met the challenges we faced 5 years ago, and we will be equally confident of meeting those that we face today."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Let us see for a moment how we have met them.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"After more than 10 years of military involvement, all of our troops have returned from Southeast Asia, and they have returned with honor."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And we can be proud of the fact that our courageous prisoners of war, for whom a dinner was held in Washington tonight, that they came home with their heads high, on their feet and not on their knees."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In our relations with the Soviet Union, we have turned away from a policy of confrontation to one of negotiation."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"For the first time since World War II, the world¡¦s two strongest powers are working together toward peace in the world."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"With the People¡¦s Republic of China, after a generation of hostile isolation, we have begun a period of peaceful exchange and expanding trade."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Peace has returned to our cities, to our campuses."
1974,Nixon,Republican,The 17-year rise in crime has been stopped.
1974,Nixon,Republican,We can confidently say today that we are finally beginning to win the war against crime.
1974,Nixon,Republican,Right here in this Nation¡¦s Capital¡Xwhich a few years ago was threatening to become the crime capital of the world¡Xthe rate in crime has been cut in half.
1974,Nixon,Republican,A massive campaign against drug abuse has been organized.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And the rate of new heroin addiction, the most vicious threat of all, is decreasing rather than increasing."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"For the first time in a generation, no young Americans are being drafted into the armed services of the United States."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And for the first time over, we have organized a massive national effort to protect the environment."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Our air is getting cleaner, our water is getting purer, and our agriculture, which was depressed, is prospering."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Farm income is up 70 percent, farm production is setting alltime records, and the billions of dollars the taxpayers were paying in subsidies has been cut to nearly zero."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Overall, Americans are living more abundantly than ever before, today."
1974,Nixon,Republican,More than 2 1/2 million new jobs were created in the past year alone.
1974,Nixon,Republican,That is the biggest percentage increase in nearly 20 years.
1974,Nixon,Republican,People are earning more.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"What they earn buys more, more than ever before in history."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In the past 5 years, the average American¡¦s real spendable income¡Xthat is, what you really can buy with your income, even after allowing for taxes and inflation- has increased by 16 percent."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Despite this record of achievement, as we turn to the year ahead we hear once again the familiar voice of the perennial prophets of gloom telling us now that because of the need to fight inflation, because of the energy shortage, America may be headed for a recession."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Let me speak to that issue head on.
1974,Nixon,Republican,There will be no recession in the United Stateds of America.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Primarily due to our energy crisis, our economy is passing through a difficult period."
1974,Nixon,Republican,But I pledge to you tonight that the full powers of this Government will be used to keep America¡¦s economy producing and to protect the jobs of America¡¦s workers.
1974,Nixon,Republican,We are engaged in a long and hard fight against inflation.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"There have been, and there will be in the future, ups and downs in that fight."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"But if this Congress cooperates in our efforts to hold down the cost of Government, we shall win our fight to hold down the cost of living for the American people."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As we look back over our history, the years that stand out as the ones of signal achievement are those in which the Administration and the Congress, whether one party or the other, working together, had the wisdom and the foresight to select those particular initiatives for which the Nation was ready and the moment was right¡Xand in which they seized the moment and acted."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Looking at the year 1974 which lies before us, there are 10 key areas in which landmark accomplishments are possible this year in America."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"If we make these our national agenda, this is what we will achieve in 1974: We will break the back of the energy crisis; we will lay the foundation for our future capacity to meet America¡¦s energy needs from America¡¦s own resources."
1974,Nixon,Republican,And we will take another giant stride toward lasting peace in the world¡Xnot only by continuing our policy of negotiation rather than confrontation where the great powers are concerned but also by helping toward the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"We will check the rise in prices without administering the harsh medicine of recession, and we will move the economy into a steady period of growth at a sustainable level."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We will establish a new system that makes high-quality health care available to every American in a dignified manner and at a price he can afford.
1974,Nixon,Republican,We will make our States and localities more responsive to the needs of their own citizens.
1974,Nixon,Republican,We will make a crucial breakthrough toward better transportation in our towns and in our cities across America.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"We will reform our system of Federal aid to education, to provide it when it is needed, where it is needed, so that it will do the most for those who need it the most."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We will make an historic beginning on the task of defining and protecting the right of personal privacy for every American.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that bleeds the taxpayer, corrodes the community, and demeans those it is intended to assist."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Another together with the other nations of the world, we will establish the economic framework within which Americans will share more fully in an expanding worldwide trade and prosperity in the years ahead, with more open access to both markets and supplies."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In all of the 186 State of the Union messages delivered from this place, in our history this is the first in which the one priority, the first priority, is energy."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Let me begin by reporting a new development which I know will be welcome news to every American.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As you know, we have committed ourselves to an active role in helping to achieve a just and durable peace in the Middle East, on the basis of full implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338."
1974,Nixon,Republican,The first step in the process is the disengagement of Egyptian and Israeli forces which is now taking place.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Because of this hopeful development, I can announce tonight that I have been assured, through my personal contacts with friendly leaders in the Middle Eastern area, that an urgent meeting will be called in the immediate future to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo."
1974,Nixon,Republican,This is an encouraging sign.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"However, it should be clearly understood by our friends in the Middle East that the United States will not be coerced on this issue."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, the cooperation of the American people in our energy conservation program has already gone a long way towards achieving a goal to which I am deeply dedicated."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Let us do everything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the United States of America.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Last week, I sent to the Congress a comprehensive special message setting forth our energy situation, recommending the legislative measures which are necessary to a program for meeting our needs."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"If the embargo is lifted, this will ease the crisis, but it will not mean an end to the energy shortage in America."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Voluntary conservation will continue to be necessary.
1974,Nixon,Republican,And let me take this occasion to pay tribute once again to the splendid spirit of cooperation the American people have shown which has made possible our success in meeting this emergency up to this time.
1974,Nixon,Republican,The new legislation I have requested will also remain necessary.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Therefore, I urge again that the energy measures that I have proposed be made the first priority of this session of the Congress."
1974,Nixon,Republican,These measures will require the oil companies and other energy producers to provide the public with the necessary information on their supplies.
1974,Nixon,Republican,They will prevent the injustice of windfall profits for a few as a result of the sacrifices of the millions of Americans.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And they will give us the organization, the incentives, the authorities needed to deal with the short-term emergency and to move toward meeting our long-term needs."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Just as 1970 was the year in which we began a full-scale effort to protect the environment, 1974 must be the year in which we organize a full-scale effort to provide for our energy needs, not only in this decade but through the 21st century."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As we move toward the celebration 2 years from now of the 200th anniversary of this Nation¡¦s independence, let us press vigorously on toward the goal I announced last November for Project Independence."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Let this be our national goal: At the end of this decade, in the year 1980, the United States will not be dependent on any other country for energy we need to provide our jobs, to heat our homes, and to keep our transportation moving."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"To indicate the size of the Government commitment, to spur energy research and development, we plan to spend $10 billion in Federal funds over the next 5 years."
1974,Nixon,Republican,That is an enormous amount.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"But during the same 5 years, private enterprise will be investing as much as $200 billion¡Xand in 10 years, $500 billion¡Xto develop the new resources, the new technology, the new capacity America will require for its energy needs in the 1980¡¦s."
1974,Nixon,Republican,That is just a measure of the magnitude of the project we are undertaking.
1974,Nixon,Republican,But America performs best when called to its biggest tasks.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"It can truly be said that only in America could a task so tremendous be achieved so quickly, and achieved not by regimentation, but through the effort and ingenuity of a free people, working in a free system."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Turning now to the rest of the agenda for 1974, the time is at hand this year to bring comprehensive, high quality health care within the reach of every American."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses."
1974,Nixon,Republican,This will be a plan that maintains the high standards of quality in America¡¦s health care.
1974,Nixon,Republican,And it will not require additional taxes.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Now, I recognize that other plans have been put forward that would cost $80 billion or even $100 billion and that would put our whole health care system under the heavy hand of the Federal Government."
1974,Nixon,Republican,This is the wrong approach.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"This has been tried abroad, and it has failed."
1974,Nixon,Republican,It is not the way we do things here in America.
1974,Nixon,Republican,This kind of plan would threaten the quality of care provided by our whole health care system.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"The right way is one that builds on the strengths of the present system and one that does not destroy those strengths, one based on partnership, not paternalism."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Most important of all, let us keep this as the guiding principle of our health programs."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Government has a great role to play, but we must always make sure that our doctors will be working for their patients and not for the Federal Government."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Many of you will recall that in my State of the Union Address 3 years ago, I commented that ¡§Most Americans today are simply fed up with government at all levels,¡¨ and I recommended a sweeping set of proposals to revitalize State and local governments, to make them more responsive to the people they serve."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharing passed by the Congress, and other measures, we have made progress toward that goal."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"After 40 years of moving power from the States and the communities to Washington, D.C., we have begun moving power back from Washington to the States and communities and, most important, to the people of America."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In this session of the Congress, I believe we are near the breakthrough point on efforts which I have suggested, proposals to let people themselves make their own decisions for their own communities and, in particular, on those to provide broad new flexibility in Federal aid for community development, for economic development, for education."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And I look forward to working with the Congress, with members of both parties in resolving whatever remaining differences we have in this legislation so that we can make available nearly $5 1/2 billion to our States and localities to use not for what a Federal bureaucrat may want, but for what their own people in those communities want."
1974,Nixon,Republican,The decision should be theirs.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I think all of us recognize that the energy crisis has given new urgency to the need to improve public transportation, not only in our cities but in rural areas as well."
1974,Nixon,Republican,The program I have proposes this year will give communities not only more money but also more freedom to balance their own transportation needs.
1974,Nixon,Republican,It will mark the strongest Federal commitment ever to the improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvement of life in our towns and cities.
1974,Nixon,Republican,One goal on which all Americans agree is that our children should have the very best education this great Nation can provide.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In a special message last week, I recommended a number of important new measures that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advances for our schools and for the children they serve."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"If the Congress will act on these proposals, more flexible funding will enable each Federal dollar to meet better the particular need of each particular school district."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Advance funding will give school authorities a chance to make each year¡¦s plans, knowing ahead of time what Federal funds they are going to receive."
1974,Nixon,Republican,Special targeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among our people.
1974,Nixon,Republican,College students faced with rising costs for their education will be able to draw on an expanded program of loans and grants.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"These advances are a needed investment in America¡¦s most precious resource, our next generation."
1974,Nixon,Republican,And I urge the Congress to act on this legislation in 1974.
1974,Nixon,Republican,One measure of a truly free society is the vigor with which it protects the liberties of its individual citizens.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As technology has advanced in America, it has increasingly encroached on one of those liberties¡Xwhat I term the right of personal privacy."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Modern information systems, data banks, credit records, mailing list abuses, electronic snooping, the collection of personal data for one purpose that may be used for another¡Xall these have left millions of Americans deeply concerned by the privacy they cherish."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And the time has come, therefore, for a major initiative to define the nature and extent of the basic rights of privacy and to erect new safeguards to ensure that those rights are respected."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I shall launch such an effort this year at the highest levels of the Administration, and I look forward again to working with this Congress in establishing a new set of standards that respect the legitimate needs of society, but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle of American liberty."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Many of those in this Chamber tonight will recall that it was 3 years ago that I termed the Nation¡¦s welfare system ¡§a monstrous, consuming outrage¡Xan outrage against the community, against the taxpayer, and particularly against the children that it is supposed to help.¡¨ That system is still an outrage."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"By improving its administration, we have been able to reduce some of the abuses."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As a result, last year, for the first time in 18 years, there has been a halt in the growth of the welfare caseload."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"But as a system, our welfare program still needs reform as urgently today as it did when I first proposed in 1969 that we completely replace it with a different system."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In these final 3 years of my Administration, I urge the congress to join me in mounting a major new effort to replace the discredited present welfare system with one that works, one that is fair to those who need help or cannot help themselves, fair to the community, and fair to the taxpayer."
1974,Nixon,Republican,And let us have as our goal that there will be no Government program which makes it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work.
1974,Nixon,Republican,I recognize that from the debates that have taken place within the Congress over the past 3 years on this program that we cannot expect enactment overnight of a new reform.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"But I do propose that the Congress and the Administration together make this the year in which we discuss, debate, and shape such a reform so that it can be enacted as quickly as possible."
1974,Nixon,Republican,America¡¦s own prosperity in the years ahead depends on our sharing fully and equitably in an expanding world prosperity.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Historic negotiations will take place this year that will enable us to ensure fair treatment in international markets for American workers, American farmers, American investors, and American consumers."
1974,Nixon,Republican,It is vital that the authorities contained in the trade bill I submitted to the Congress be enacted so that the United States can negotiate flexibly and vigorously on behalf of American interests.
1974,Nixon,Republican,These negotiations can usher in a new era of international trade that not only increases the prosperity of all nations but also strengthens the peace among all nations.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In the past 5 years, we have made more progress toward a lasting structure of peace in the world than in any comparable time in the Nation¡¦s history."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We could not have made that progress if we had not maintained the military strength of America.
1974,Nixon,Republican,Thomas Jefferson once observed that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"By the same token, and for the same reason, in today¡¦s world the price of peace is a strong defense as far as the United States is concerned."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In the past 5 years, we have steadily reduced the burden of national defense as a share of the budget, bringing it down from 44 percent in 1969 to 29 percent in the current year."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"We have cut our military manpower over the past 5 years by more than a third, from 3.5 million to 2.2 million."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In the coming year, however, increased expenditures will be needed."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"They will be needed to assure the continued readiness of our military forces, to preserve present force levels in the face of rising costs, and to give us the military strength we must have if our security is to be maintained and if our initiatives for peace are to succeed."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"The question is not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary strength of our defense, the question is whether we can afford not to maintain it, and the answer to that question is no."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We must never allow America to become the second strongest nation in the world.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I do not say this with any sense of belligerence, because I recognize the fact that is recognized around the world."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"America¡¦s military strength has always been maintained to keep the peace, never to break it."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"It has always been used to defend freedom, never to destroy it."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"The world¡¦s peace, as well as our own, depends on our remaining as strong as we need to be as long as we need to be."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In this year 1974, we will be negotiating with the Soviet Union to place further limits on strategic nuclear arms."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Together with our allies, we will be negotiating with the nations of the Warsaw Pact on mutual and balanced reduction of forces in Europe."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And we will continue our efforts to promote peaceful economic development in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"We will press for full compliance with the peace accords that brought an end to American fighting in Indochina, including particularly a provision that promised the fullest possible accounting for those Americans who are missing in action."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And having in mind the energy crisis to which I have referred to earlier, we will be working with the other nations of the world toward agreement on means by which oil supplies can be assured at reasonable prices on a stable basis in a fair way to the consuming and producing nations alike."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"All of these are steps toward a future in which the world¡¦s peace and prosperity, and ours as well as a result, are made more secure."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Throughout the 5 years that I have served as your President, I have had one overriding aim, and that was to establish a new structure of peace in the world that can free future generations of the scourge of war."
1974,Nixon,Republican,I can understand that others may have different priorities.
1974,Nixon,Republican,This has been and this will remain my first priority and the chief legacy I hope to leave from the 8 years of my Presidency.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"This does not mean that we shall not have other priorities, because as we strengthen the peace, we must also continue each year a steady strengthening of our society here at home."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Our conscience requires it, our interests require it, and we must insist upon it."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As we create more jobs, as we build a better health care system, as we improve our education, as we develop new sources of energy, as we provide more abundantly for the elderly and the poor, as we strengthen the system of private enterprise that produces our prosperity¡Xas we do all of this and even more, we solidify those essential bonds that hold us together as a nation."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Even more importantly, we advance what in the final analysis government in America is all about."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"What it is all about is more freedom, more security, a better life for each one of the 211 million people that live in this land."
1974,Nixon,Republican,We cannot afford to neglect progress at home while pursuing peace abroad.
1974,Nixon,Republican,But neither can we afford to neglect peace abroad while pursuing progress at home.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"With a stable peace, all is possible, but without peace, nothing is possible."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"In the written message that I have just delivered to the Speaker and to the President of the Senate, I commented that one of the continuing challenges facing us in the legislative process is that of the timing and pacing of our initiatives, selecting each year among many worthy projects those that are ripe for action at that time."
1974,Nixon,Republican,What is true in terms of our domestic initiatives is true also in the world.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"This period we now are in, in the world¡Xand I say this as one who has seen so much of the world, not only in these past 5 years but going back over many years¡Xwe are in a period which presents a juncture of historic forces unique in this century."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"They provide an opportunity we may never have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last a lifetime and more, not just peace in our time but peace in our children¡¦s time as well."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"It is on the way we respond to this opportunity, more than anything else, that history will judge whether we in America have met our responsibility."
1974,Nixon,Republican,And I am confident we will meet that great historic responsibility which is ours today.
1974,Nixon,Republican,It was 27 years ago that John F.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Kennedy and I sat in this Chamber, as freshmen Congressmen, hearing our first State of the Union address delivered by Harry Truman."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I know from my talks with him, as members of the Labor Committee on which we both served, that neither of us then even dreamed that either one or both might eventually be standing in this place that I now stand in now and that he once stood in, before me."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"It may well be that one of the freshmen Members of the 93d Congress, one of you out there, will deliver his own State of the Union message 27 years from now, in the year 2001."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Well, whichever one it is, I want you to be able to look back with pride and to say that your first years here were great years and recall that you were here in this 93d Congress when America ended its longest war and began its longest peace. [At this point, the President paused to acknowledge applause from the audience."
1974,Nixon,Republican,He then resumed speaking.] Mr.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Speaker, and Mr."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"President, and my distinguished colleagues and our guests: I would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that has been of great concern to all Americans over the past year."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I refer, of course, to the investigations of the so-called Watergate affair."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"As you know, I have provided to the Special Prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of material."
1974,Nixon,Republican,I believe that I have provided all the material that he needs to conclude his investigations and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to clear the innocent.
1974,Nixon,Republican,I believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other investigations of this matter to an end.
1974,Nixon,Republican,One year of Watergate is enough.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And the time has come, my colleagues, for not only the Executive, the President, but the Members of Congress, for all of us to join together in devoting our full energies to these great issues that I have discussed tonight which involve the welfare of all of the American people in so many different ways, as well as the peace of the world."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I recognize that the House Judiciary Committee has a special responsibility in this area, and I want to indicate on this occasion that I will cooperate with the Judiciary Committee in its investigation."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"I will cooperate so that it can conclude its investigation, make its decision, and I will cooperate in any way that I consider consistent with my responsibilities to the Office of the Presidency of the United States. ¡@There is only one limitation."
1974,Nixon,Republican,I will follow the precedent that has been followed by and defended by every President from George Washington to Lyndon B.
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Johnson of never doing anything that weakens the Office of the President of the United States or impairs the ability of the Presidents of the future to make the great decisions that are so essential to this Nation and the world. ¡@Another point should like to make very briefly: Like every Member of the House and Senate assembled here tonight, I was elected to the office that I hold."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And like every Member of the House and Senate, when I was elected to that office, I knew that I was elected for the purpose of doing a job and doing it as well as I possibly can."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And I want you to know that I have no intention whatever of ever walking away from the job that the people elected me to do for the people of the United States. ¡@Now, needless to say, it would be understatement if I were not to admit that the year 1973 was not a very easy year for me personally or for my family."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"And as I have already indicated, the year 1974 presents very great and serious problems, as very great and serious opportunities are also presented."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"But my colleagues, this I believe: With the help of God, who has blessed this land so richly, with the cooperation of the Congress, and with the support of the American people, we can and we will make the year 1974 a year of unprecedented progress toward our goal of building a structure of lasting peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the United States of America."
1974,Nixon,Republican,"Note: The President spoke at 9:05 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol after being introduced by Carl Albert, Speaker of the House of Representatives."
1974,Nixon,Republican,The address was broadcast live on nationwide radio and television.

1975,Ford,Republican,PRESIDENT GERALD R.
1975,Ford,Republican,"FORD'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS REPORTING ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 15, 1975 Mr."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and distinguished guests: Twenty-six years ago, a freshman Congressman, a young fellow with lots of idealism who was out to change the world, stood before Sam Rayburn in the well of the House and solemnly swore to the same oath that all of you took yesterday--an unforgettable experience, and I congratulate you all."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Two days later, that same freshman stood at the back of this great Chamber--over there someplace--as President Truman, all charged up by his single-handed election victory, reported as the Constitution requires on the state of the Union."
1975,Ford,Republican,"When the bipartisan applause stopped, President Truman said, ""I am happy to report to this 81st Congress that the state of the Union is good."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Our Nation is better able than ever before to meet the needs of the American people, and to give them their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness. [It] is foremost among the nations of the world in the search for peace."" Today, that freshman Member from Michigan stands where Mr."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Truman stood, and I must say to you that the state of the Union is not good: Millions of Americans are out of work."
1975,Ford,Republican,Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Prices are too high, and sales are too slow."
1975,Ford,Republican,This year's Federal deficit will be about $30 billion; next year's probably $45 billion.
1975,Ford,Republican,The national debt will rise to over $500 billion.
1975,Ford,Republican,Our plant capacity and productivity are not increasing fast enough.
1975,Ford,Republican,We depend on others for essential energy.
1975,Ford,Republican,Some people question their Government's ability to make hard decisions and stick with them; they expect Washington politics as usual.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Yet, what President Truman said on January 5, 1949, is even more true in 1975."
1975,Ford,Republican,We are better able to meet our people's needs.
1975,Ford,Republican,All Americans do have a fairer chance to pursue happiness.
1975,Ford,Republican,Not only are we still the foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but today's prospects of attaining it are infinitely brighter.
1975,Ford,Republican,There were 59 million Americans employed at the start of 1949; now there are more than 85 million Americans who have jobs.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In comparable dollars, the average income of the American family has doubled during the past 26 years."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Now, I want to speak very bluntly."
1975,Ford,Republican,"I've got bad news, and I don't expect much, if any, applause."
1975,Ford,Republican,"The American people want action, and it will take both the Congress and the President to give them what they want."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Progress and solutions can be achieved, and they will be achieved."
1975,Ford,Republican,My message today is not intended to address all of the complex needs of America.
1975,Ford,Republican,"I will send separate messages making specific recommendations for domestic legislation, such as the extension of general revenue sharing and the Voting Rights Act."
1975,Ford,Republican,The moment has come to move in a new direction.
1975,Ford,Republican,"We can do this by fashioning a new partnership between the Congress on the one hand, the White House on the other, and the people we both represent."
1975,Ford,Republican,Let us mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation that ever existed on this Earth to put all our people to work.
1975,Ford,Republican,The emphasis on our economic efforts must now shift from inflation to jobs.
1975,Ford,Republican,"To bolster business and industry and to create new jobs, I propose a 1-year tax reduction of $16 billion."
1975,Ford,Republican,Three-quarters would go to individuals and one-quarter to promote business investment.
1975,Ford,Republican,"This cash rebate to individuals amounts to 12 percent of 1974 tax payments--a total cut of $12 billion, with a maximum of $1,000 per return."
1975,Ford,Republican,I call on the Congress to act by April 1.
1975,Ford,Republican,If you do--and I hope you will--the Treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in May and the second by September.
1975,Ford,Republican,"The other one-fourth of the cut, about $4 billion, will go to business, including farms, to promote expansion and to create more jobs."
1975,Ford,Republican,The 1-year reduction for businesses would be in the form of a liberalized investment tax credit increasing the rate to 12 percent for all businesses.
1975,Ford,Republican,This tax cut does not include the more fundamental reforms needed in our tax system.
1975,Ford,Republican,But it points us in the right direction--allowing taxpayers rather than the Government to spend their pay.
1975,Ford,Republican,Cutting taxes now is essential if we are to turn the economy around.
1975,Ford,Republican,A tax cut offers the best hope of creating more jobs.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Unfortunately, it will increase the size of the budget deficit."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Therefore, it is more important than ever that we take steps to control the growth of Federal expenditures."
1975,Ford,Republican,Part of our trouble is that we have been self-indulgent.
1975,Ford,Republican,"For decades, we have been voting ever-increasing levels of Government benefits, and now the bill has come due."
1975,Ford,Republican,We have been adding so many new programs that the size and the growth of the Federal budget has taken on a life of its own.
1975,Ford,Republican,One characteristic of these programs is that their cost increases automatically every year because the number of people eligible for most of the benefits increases every year.
1975,Ford,Republican,"When these programs are enacted, there is no dollar amount set."
1975,Ford,Republican,No one knows what they will cost.
1975,Ford,Republican,"All we know is that whatever they cost last year, they will cost more next year."
1975,Ford,Republican,It is a question of simple arithmetic.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Unless we check the excessive growth of Federal expenditures or impose on ourselves matching increases in taxes, we will continue to run huge inflationary deficits in the Federal budget."
1975,Ford,Republican,"If we project the current built-in momentum of Federal spending through the next 15 years, State, Federal, and local government expenditures could easily comprise half of our gross national product."
1975,Ford,Republican,This compares with less than a third in 1975.
1975,Ford,Republican,I have just concluded the process of preparing the budget submissions for fiscal year 1976.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In that budget, I will propose legislation to restrain the growth of a number of existing programs."
1975,Ford,Republican,"I have also concluded that no new spending programs can be initiated this year, except for energy."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Further, I will not hesitate to veto any new spending programs adopted by the Congress."
1975,Ford,Republican,"As an additional step toward putting the Federal Government's house in order, I recommend a 5-percent limit on Federal pay increases in 1975."
1975,Ford,Republican,"In all Government programs tied to the Consumer Price Index--including social security, civil service and military retirement pay, and food stamps--I also propose a 1-year maximum increase of 5 percent."
1975,Ford,Republican,"None of these recommended ceiling limitations, over which Congress has final authority, are easy to propose, because in most cases they involve anticipated payments to many, many deserving people."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Nonetheless, it must be done."
1975,Ford,Republican,"I must emphasize that I am not asking to eliminate, to reduce, to freeze these payments."
1975,Ford,Republican,I am merely recommending that we slow down the rate at which these payments increase and these programs grow.
1975,Ford,Republican,Only a reduction in the growth of spending can keep Federal borrowing down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rates.
1975,Ford,Republican,Only a reduction in spending can make it possible for the Federal Reserve System to avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore balance to our economy.
1975,Ford,Republican,A major reduction in the growth of Federal spending can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about our economy and put us on the way to curing our economic ills.
1975,Ford,Republican,"If we don't act to slow down the rate of increase in Federal spending, the United States Treasury will be legally obligated to spend more than $360 billion in fiscal year 1976, even if no new programs are enacted."
1975,Ford,Republican,"These are not matters of conjecture or prediction, but again, a matter of simple arithmetic."
1975,Ford,Republican,The size of these numbers and their implications for our everyday life and the health of our economic system are shocking.
1975,Ford,Republican,I submitted to the last Congress a list of budget deferrals and rescissions.
1975,Ford,Republican,There will be more cuts recommended in the budget that I will submit.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Even so, the level of outlays for fiscal year 1976 is still much, much too high."
1975,Ford,Republican,Not only is it too high for this year but the decisions we make now will inevitably have a major and growing impact on expenditure levels in future years.
1975,Ford,Republican,"I think this is a very fundamental issue that we, the Congress and I, must jointly solve."
1975,Ford,Republican,Economic disruptions we and others are experiencing stem in part from the fact that the world price of petroleum has quadrupled in the last year.
1975,Ford,Republican,"But in all honesty, we cannot put all of the blame on the oil-exporting nations."
1975,Ford,Republican,"We, the United States, are not blameless."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Our growing dependence upon foreign sources has been adding to our vulnerability for years and years, and we did nothing to prepare ourselves for such an event as the embargo of 1973."
1975,Ford,Republican,"During the 1960's, this country had a surplus capacity of crude oil which we were able to make available to our trading partners whenever there was a disruption of supply."
1975,Ford,Republican,This surplus capacity enabled us to influence both supplies and prices of crude oil throughout the world.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Our excess capacity neutralized any effort at establishing an effective cartel, and thus the rest of the world was assured of adequate supplies of oil at reasonable prices."
1975,Ford,Republican,"By 1970, our surplus capacity had vanished, and as a consequence, the latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Europe and Japan, both heavily dependent on imported oil, now struggle to keep their economies in balance."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Even the United States, our country, which is far more self-sufficient than most other industrial countries, has been put under serious pressure."
1975,Ford,Republican,I am proposing a program which will begin to restore our country's surplus capacity in total energy.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In this way, we will be able to assure ourselves reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability for other major consuming nations."
1975,Ford,Republican,"But this Nation and, in fact, the world must face the prospect of energy difficulties between now and 1985."
1975,Ford,Republican,This program will impose burdens on all of us with the aim of reducing our consumption of energy and increasing our production.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Great attention has been paid to the considerations of fairness, and I can assure you that the burdens will not fall more harshly on those less able to bear them."
1975,Ford,Republican,I am recommending a plan to make us invulnerable to cutoffs of foreign oil.
1975,Ford,Republican,"It will require sacrifices, but it--and this is most important--it will work."
1975,Ford,Republican,"I have set the following national energy goals to assure that our future is as secure and as productive as our past: First, we must reduce oil imports by 1 million barrels per day by the end of this year and by 2 million barrels per day by the end of 1977."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Second, we must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign suppliers by 1985."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Third, we must develop our energy technology and resources so that the United States has the ability to supply a significant share of the energy needs of the free world by the end of this century."
1975,Ford,Republican,"To attain these objectives, we need immediate action to cut imports."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Unfortunately, in the short term there are only a limited number of actions which can increase domestic supply."
1975,Ford,Republican,I will press for all of them.
1975,Ford,Republican,"I urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial production at the Elk Hills, California, Naval Petroleum Reserve."
1975,Ford,Republican,"In order that we make greater use of domestic coal resources, I am submitting amendments to the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act which will greatly increase the number of powerplants that can be promptly converted to coal."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Obviously, voluntary conservation continues to be essential, but tougher programs are needed--and needed now."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Therefore, I am using Presidential powers to raise the fee on all imported crude oil and petroleum products."
1975,Ford,Republican,"The crude oil fee level will be increased $1 per barrel on February 1, by $2 per barrel on March 1, and by $3 per barrel on April 1."
1975,Ford,Republican,I will take actions to reduce undue hardships on any geographical region.
1975,Ford,Republican,The foregoing are interim administrative actions.
1975,Ford,Republican,They will be rescinded when broader but necessary legislation is enacted.
1975,Ford,Republican,"To that end, I am requesting the Congress to act within 90 days on a more comprehensive energy tax program."
1975,Ford,Republican,It includes: excise taxes and import fees totaling $2 per barrel on product imports and on all crude oil; deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax.
1975,Ford,Republican,I plan to take Presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic crude oil on April 1.
1975,Ford,Republican,I urge the Congress to enact a windfall profits tax by that date to ensure that oil producers do not profit unduly.
1975,Ford,Republican,"The sooner Congress acts, the more effective the oil conservation program will be and the quicker the Federal revenues can be returned to our people."
1975,Ford,Republican,"I am prepared to use Presidential authority to limit imports, as necessary, to guarantee success."
1975,Ford,Republican,"I want you to know that before deciding on my energy conservation program, I considered rationing and higher gasoline taxes as alternatives."
1975,Ford,Republican,"In my judgment, neither would achieve the desired results and both would produce unacceptable inequities."
1975,Ford,Republican,"A massive program must be initiated to increase energy supply to cut demand, and provide new standby emergency programs to achieve the independence we want by 1985."
1975,Ford,Republican,The largest part of increased oil production must come from new frontier areas on the Outer Continental Shelf and from the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4 in Alaska.
1975,Ford,Republican,"It is the intent of this Administration to move ahead with exploration, leasing, and production on those frontier areas of the Outer Continental Shelf where the environmental risks are acceptable."
1975,Ford,Republican,Use of our most abundant domestic resource--coal--is severely limited.
1975,Ford,Republican,We must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concerns with coal.
1975,Ford,Republican,I am submitting Clean Air [Act] amendments which will allow greater coal use without sacrificing clean air goals.
1975,Ford,Republican,I vetoed the strip mining legislation passed by the last Congress.
1975,Ford,Republican,"With appropriate changes, I will sign a revised version when it comes to the White House."
1975,Ford,Republican,I am proposing a number of actions to energize our nuclear power program.
1975,Ford,Republican,I will submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing [licensing] and the rapid selection of sites.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In recent months, utilities have cancelled or postponed over 60 percent of planned nuclear expansion and 30 percent of planned additions to non-nuclear capacity."
1975,Ford,Republican,Financing problems for that industry are worsening.
1975,Ford,Republican,I am therefore recommending that the 1-year investment tax credit of 12 percent be extended an additional 2 years to specifically speed the construction of powerplants that do not use natural gas or oil.
1975,Ford,Republican,I am also submitting proposals for selective reform of State utility commission regulations.
1975,Ford,Republican,"To provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in the face of world price uncertainty, I will request legislation to authorize and require tariffs, import quotas, or price floors to protect our energy prices at levels which will achieve energy independence."
1975,Ford,Republican,Increasing energy supplies is not enough.
1975,Ford,Republican,We must take additional steps to cut long-term consumption.
1975,Ford,Republican,"I therefore propose to the Congress: legislation to make thermal efficiency standards mandatory for all new buildings in the United States; a new tax credit of up to $150 for those homeowners who install insulation equipment; the establishment of an energy conservation program to help low-income families purchase insulation supplies; legislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standards for 5 years, which will enable us to improve automobile gas mileage by 40 percent by 1980."
1975,Ford,Republican,"These proposals and actions, cumulatively, can reduce our dependence on foreign energy supplies from 3 to 5 million barrels per day by 1985."
1975,Ford,Republican,"To make the United States invulnerable to foreign disruption, I propose standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of 1 billion barrels of oil for domestic needs and 300 million barrels for national defense purposes."
1975,Ford,Republican,I will ask for the funds needed for energy research and development activities.
1975,Ford,Republican,I have established a goal of 1 million barrels of synthetic fuels and shale oil production per day by 1985 together with an incentive program to achieve it.
1975,Ford,Republican,I have a very deep belief in America's capabilities.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Within the next 10 years, my program envisions: 200 major nuclear powerplants; 250 major new coal mines; 150 major coal-fired powerplants; 30 major new [oil] refineries; 20 major new synthetic fuel plants; the drilling of many thousands of new oil wells; the insulation of 18 million homes; and the manufacturing and the sale of millions of new automobiles, trucks, and buses that use much less fuel."
1975,Ford,Republican,I happen to believe that we can do it.
1975,Ford,Republican,In another crisis--the one in 1942--President Franklin D.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Roosevelt said this country would build 60,000 [50,000] military aircraft."
1975,Ford,Republican,"By 1943, production in that program had reached 125,000 aircraft annually."
1975,Ford,Republican,They did it then.
1975,Ford,Republican,We can do it now.
1975,Ford,Republican,"If the Congress and the American people will work with me to attain these targets, they will be achieved and will be surpassed."
1975,Ford,Republican,"From adversity, let us seize opportunity."
1975,Ford,Republican,Revenues of some $30 billion from higher energy taxes designed to encourage conservation must be refunded to the American people in a manner which corrects distortions in our tax system wrought by inflation.
1975,Ford,Republican,"People have been pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation, with consequent reduction in their actual spending power."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Business taxes are similarly distorted because inflation exaggerates reported profits, resulting in excessive taxes."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Accordingly, I propose that future individual income taxes be reduced by $16.5 billion."
1975,Ford,Republican,This will be done by raising the low-income allowance and reducing tax rates.
1975,Ford,Republican,This continuing tax cut will primarily benefit lower- and middle-income taxpayers.
1975,Ford,Republican,"For example, a typical family of four with a gross income of $5,600 now pays $185 in Federal income taxes."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Under this tax cut plan, they would pay nothing."
1975,Ford,Republican,"A family of four with a gross income of $12,500 now pays $1,260 in Federal taxes."
1975,Ford,Republican,My proposal reduces that total by $300.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Families grossing $20,000 would receive a reduction of $210."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Those with the very lowest incomes, who can least afford higher costs, must also be compensated."
1975,Ford,Republican,I propose a payment of $80 to every person 18 years of age and older in that very limited category.
1975,Ford,Republican,State and local governments will receive $2 billion in additional revenue sharing to offset their increased energy costs.
1975,Ford,Republican,"To offset inflationary distortions and to generate more economic activity, the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 48 percent to 42 percent."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Now let me turn, if I might, to the international dimension of the present crisis."
1975,Ford,Republican,At no time in our peacetime history has the state of the Nation depended more heavily on the state of the world.
1975,Ford,Republican,"And seldom, if ever, has the state of the world depended more heavily on the state of our Nation."
1975,Ford,Republican,The economic distress is global.
1975,Ford,Republican,We will not solve it at home unless we help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad.
1975,Ford,Republican,"World trade and monetary structure provides markets, energy, food, and vital raw materials--for all nations."
1975,Ford,Republican,This international system is now in jeopardy.
1975,Ford,Republican,This Nation can be proud of significant achievements in recent years in solving problems and crises.
1975,Ford,Republican,"The Berlin agreement, the SALT agreements, our new relationship with China, the unprecedented efforts in the Middle East are immensely encouraging."
1975,Ford,Republican,But the world is not free from crisis.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In a world of 150 nations, where nuclear technology is proliferating and regional conflicts continue, international security cannot be taken for granted."
1975,Ford,Republican,"So, let there be no mistake about it: International cooperation is a vital factor of our lives today."
1975,Ford,Republican,This is not a moment for the American people to turn inward.
1975,Ford,Republican,"More than ever before, our own well-being depends on America's determination and America's leadership in the whole wide world."
1975,Ford,Republican,"We are a great Nation--spiritually, politically, militarily, diplomatically, and economically."
1975,Ford,Republican,"America's commitment to international security has sustained the safety of allies and friends in many areas-- in the Middle East, in Europe, and in Asia."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Our turning away would unleash new instabilities, new dangers around the globe, which, in turn, would threaten our own security."
1975,Ford,Republican,"At the end of World War II, we turned a similar challenge into an historic opportunity and, I might add, an historic achievement."
1975,Ford,Republican,An old order was in disarray; political and economic institutions were shattered.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In that period, this Nation and its partners built new institutions, new mechanisms of mutual support and cooperation."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Today, as then, we face an historic opportunity."
1975,Ford,Republican,"If we act imaginatively and boldly, as we acted then, this period will in retrospect be seen as one of the great creative moments of our Nation's history."
1975,Ford,Republican,The whole world is watching to see how we respond.
1975,Ford,Republican,A resurgent American economy would do more to restore the confidence of the world in its own future than anything else we can do.
1975,Ford,Republican,The program that this Congress passes can demonstrate to the world that we have started to put our own house in order.
1975,Ford,Republican,"If we can show that this Nation is able and willing to help other nations meet the common challenge, it can demonstrate that the United States will fulfill its responsibilities as a leader among nations."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Quite frankly, at stake is the future of industrialized democracies, which have perceived their destiny in common and sustained it in common for 30 years."
1975,Ford,Republican,The developing nations are also at a turning point.
1975,Ford,Republican,The poorest nations see their hopes of feeding their hungry and developing their societies shattered by the economic crisis.
1975,Ford,Republican,The long-term economic future for the producers of raw materials also depends on cooperative solutions.
1975,Ford,Republican,Our relations with the Communist countries are a basic factor of the world environment.
1975,Ford,Republican,We must seek to build a long-term basis for coexistence.
1975,Ford,Republican,We will stand by our principles.
1975,Ford,Republican,We will stand by our interests.
1975,Ford,Republican,We will act firmly when challenged.
1975,Ford,Republican,The kind of a world we want depends on a broad policy of creating mutual incentives for restraint and for cooperation.
1975,Ford,Republican,"As we move forward to meet our global challenges and opportunities, we must have the tools to do the job."
1975,Ford,Republican,Our military forces are strong and ready.
1975,Ford,Republican,"This military strength deters aggression against our allies, stabilizes our relations with former adversaries, and protects our homeland."
1975,Ford,Republican,"Fully adequate conventional and strategic forces cost many, many billions, but these dollars are sound insurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world."
1975,Ford,Republican,Military strength alone is not sufficient.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Effective diplomacy is also essential in preventing conflict, in building world understanding."
1975,Ford,Republican,The Vladivostok negotiations with the Soviet Union represent a major step in moderating strategic arms competition.
1975,Ford,Republican,"My recent discussions with the leaders of the Atlantic community, Japan, and South Korea have contributed to meeting the common challenge."
1975,Ford,Republican,But we have serious problems before us that require cooperation between the President and the Congress.
1975,Ford,Republican,"By the Constitution and tradition, the execution of foreign policy is the responsibility of the President."
1975,Ford,Republican,"In recent years, under the stress of the Vietnam war, legislative restrictions on the President's ability to execute foreign policy and military decisions have proliferated."
1975,Ford,Republican,"As a Member of the Congress, I opposed some and I approved others."
1975,Ford,Republican,"As President, I welcome the advice and cooperation of the House and the Senate."
1975,Ford,Republican,"But if our foreign policy is to be successful, we cannot rigidly restrict in legislation the ability of the President to act."
1975,Ford,Republican,The conduct of negotiations is ill-suited to such limitations.
1975,Ford,Republican,"Legislative restrictions, intended for the best motives and purposes, can have the opposite result, as we have seen most recently in our trade relations with the Soviet Union."
1975,Ford,Republican,"For my part, I pledge this Administration will act in the closest consultation with the Congress as we face delicate situations and troubled times throughout the globe."
1975,Ford,Republican,"When I became President only 5 months ago, I promised the last Congress a policy of communication, conciliation, compromise, and cooperation."
1975,Ford,Republican,I renew that pledge to the new Members of this Congress.
1975,Ford,Republican,Let me sum it up.
1975,Ford,Republican,"America needs a new direction, which I have sought to chart here today--a change of course which will: put the unemployed back to work; increase real income and production; restrain the growth of Federal Government spending; achieve energy independence; and advance the cause of world understanding."
1975,Ford,Republican,We have the ability.
1975,Ford,Republican,We have the know-how.
1975,Ford,Republican,"In partnership with the American people, we will achieve these objectives."
1975,Ford,Republican,"As our 200th anniversary approaches, we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to rebuild our political and economic strength."
1975,Ford,Republican,Let us make America once again and for centuries more to come what it has so long been--a stronghold and a beacon-light of liberty for the whole world.
1975,Ford,Republican,Thank you.
1976,Ford,Republican,PRESIDENT GERALD R.
1976,Ford,Republican,"FORD'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS REPORTING ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 19, 1976 Mr."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Vice President, Members of the 94th Congress, and distinguished guests: As we begin our Bicentennial, America is still one of the youngest nations in recorded history."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Long before our forefathers came to these shores, men and women had been struggling on this planet to forge a better life for themselves and their families."
1976,Ford,Republican,"In man's long, upward march from savagery and slavery--throughout the nearly 2,000 years of the Christian calendar, the nearly 6,000 years of Jewish reckoning--there have been many deep, terrifying valleys, but also many bright and towering peaks."
1976,Ford,Republican,One peak stands highest in the ranges of human history.
1976,Ford,Republican,One example shines forth of a people uniting to produce abundance and to share the good life fairly and with freedom.
1976,Ford,Republican,One union holds out the promise of justice and opportunity for every citizen: That union is the United States of America.
1976,Ford,Republican,We have not remade paradise on Earth.
1976,Ford,Republican,We know perfection will not be found here.
1976,Ford,Republican,But think for a minute how far we have come in 200 years.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We came from many roots, and we have many branches."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Yet all Americans across the eight generations that separate us from the stirring deeds of 1776, those who know no other homeland and those who just found refuge among our shores, say in unison: I am proud of America, and I am proud to be an American."
1976,Ford,Republican,Life will be a little better here for my children than for me.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I believe this not because I am told to believe it, but because life has been better for me than it was for my father and my mother."
1976,Ford,Republican,"I know it will be better for my children because my hands, my brains, my voice, and my vote can help make it happen."
1976,Ford,Republican,It has happened here in America.
1976,Ford,Republican,It has happened to you and to me.
1976,Ford,Republican,Government exists to create and preserve conditions in which people can translate their ideas into practical reality.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In the best of times, much is lost in translation."
1976,Ford,Republican,But we try.
1976,Ford,Republican,Sometimes we have tried and failed.
1976,Ford,Republican,Always we have had the best of intentions.
1976,Ford,Republican,"But in the recent past, we sometimes forgot the sound principles that guided us through most of our history."
1976,Ford,Republican,We wanted to accomplish great things and solve age-old problems.
1976,Ford,Republican,And we became overconfident of our abilities.
1976,Ford,Republican,We tried to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We thought we could transform the country through massive national programs, but often the programs did not work."
1976,Ford,Republican,Too often they only made things worse.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In our rush to accomplish great deeds quickly, we trampled on sound principles of restraint and endangered the rights of individuals."
1976,Ford,Republican,We unbalanced our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of Federal expenditures and borrowing.
1976,Ford,Republican,And we were not totally honest with ourselves about how much these programs would cost and how we would pay for them.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Finally, we shifted our emphasis from defense to domestic problems while our adversaries continued a massive buildup of arms."
1976,Ford,Republican,The time has now come for a fundamentally different approach--for a new realism that is true to the great principles upon which this Nation was founded.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We must introduce a new balance to our economy--a balance that favors not only sound, active government but also a much more vigorous, healthy economy that can create new jobs and hold down prices."
1976,Ford,Republican,We must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government--a balance that favors greater individual freedom and self-reliance.
1976,Ford,Republican,We must strike a new balance in our system of federalism--a balance that favors greater responsibility and freedom for the leaders of our State and local governments.
1976,Ford,Republican,We must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic programs and spending on defense--a balance that ensures we will fully meet our obligation to the needy while also protecting our security in a world that is still hostile to freedom.
1976,Ford,Republican,"And in all that we do, we must be more honest with the American people, promising them no more than we can deliver and delivering all that we promise."
1976,Ford,Republican,The genius of America has been its incredible ability to improve the lives of its citizens through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity.
1976,Ford,Republican,"History and experience tells us that moral progress cannot come in comfortable and in complacent times, but out of trial and out of confusion."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Tom Paine aroused the troubled Americans of 1776 to stand up to the times that try men's souls because the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph."
1976,Ford,Republican,Just a year ago I reported that the state of the Union was not good.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Tonight, I report that the state of our Union is better--in many ways a lot better--but still not good enough."
1976,Ford,Republican,"To paraphrase Tom Paine, 1975 was not a year for summer soldiers and sunshine patriots."
1976,Ford,Republican,It was a year of fears and alarms and of dire forecasts-- most of which never happened and won't happen.
1976,Ford,Republican,"As you recall, the year 1975 opened with rancor and with bitterness."
1976,Ford,Republican,Political misdeeds of the past had neither been forgotten nor forgiven.
1976,Ford,Republican,"The longest, most divisive war in our history was winding toward an unhappy conclusion."
1976,Ford,Republican,Many feared that the end of that foreign war of men and machines meant the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and reprisal.
1976,Ford,Republican,Friends and adversaries abroad were asking whether America had lost its nerve.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Finally, our economy was ravaged by inflation--inflation that was plunging us into the worse recession in four decades."
1976,Ford,Republican,"At the same time, Americans became increasingly alienated from big institutions."
1976,Ford,Republican,"They were steadily losing confidence, not just in big government but in big business, big labor, and big education, among others."
1976,Ford,Republican,Ours was a troubled land.
1976,Ford,Republican,"And so, 1975 was a year of hard decisions, difficult compromises, and a new realism that taught us something important about America."
1976,Ford,Republican,"It brought back a needed measure of common sense, steadfastness, and self-discipline."
1976,Ford,Republican,Americans did not panic or demand instant but useless cures.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In all sectors, people met their difficult problems with the restraint and with responsibility worthy of their great heritage."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Add up the separate pieces of progress in 1975, subtract the setbacks, and the sum total shows that we are not only headed in a new direction, a direction which I proposed 12 months ago, but it turned out to be the right direction."
1976,Ford,Republican,"It is the right direction because it follows the truly revolutionary American concept of 1776, which holds that in a free society the making of public policy and successful problemsolving involves much more than government."
1976,Ford,Republican,"It involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government, private institutions, and individual citizens."
1976,Ford,Republican,Common sense tells me to stick to that steady course.
1976,Ford,Republican,Take the state of our economy.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Last January, most things were rapidly getting worse."
1976,Ford,Republican,"This January, most things are slowly but surely getting better."
1976,Ford,Republican,The worst recession since World War II turned around in April.
1976,Ford,Republican,The best cost-of-living news of the past year is that double-digit inflation of 12 percent or higher was cut almost in half.
1976,Ford,Republican,The worst--unemployment remains far too high.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Today, nearly 1,700,000 more Americans are working than at the bottom of the recession."
1976,Ford,Republican,"At year's end, people were again being hired much faster than they were being laid off."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Yet, let's be honest."
1976,Ford,Republican,Many Americans have not yet felt these changes in their daily lives.
1976,Ford,Republican,"They still see prices going up far too fast, and they still know the fear of unemployment."
1976,Ford,Republican,We are also a growing nation.
1976,Ford,Republican,We need more and more jobs every year.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Today's economy has produced over 85 million jobs for Americans, but we need a lot more jobs, especially for the young."
1976,Ford,Republican,My first objective is to have sound economic growth without inflation.
1976,Ford,Republican,We all know from recent experience what runaway inflation does to ruin every other worthy purpose.
1976,Ford,Republican,We are slowing it.
1976,Ford,Republican,We must stop it cold.
1976,Ford,Republican,"For many Americans, the way to a healthy, noninflationary economy has become increasingly apparent."
1976,Ford,Republican,The Government must stop spending so much and stop borrowing so much of our money.
1976,Ford,Republican,More money must remain in private hands where it will do the most good.
1976,Ford,Republican,"To hold down the cost of living, we must hold down the cost of government."
1976,Ford,Republican,"In the past decade, the Federal budget has been growing at an average rate of over 10 percent a year."
1976,Ford,Republican,The budget I am submitting Wednesday cuts this rate of growth in half.
1976,Ford,Republican,I have kept my promise to submit a budget for the next fiscal year of $395 billion.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In fact, it is $394.2 billion."
1976,Ford,Republican,"By holding down the growth of Federal spending, we can afford additional tax cuts and return to the people who pay taxes more decisionmaking power over their own lives."
1976,Ford,Republican,Last month I signed legislation to extend the 1975 tax reductions for the first 6 months of this year.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I now propose that effective July 1, 1976, we give our taxpayers a tax cut of approximately $10 billion more than Congress agreed to in December."
1976,Ford,Republican,"My broader tax reduction would mean that for a family of four making $15,000 a year, there will be $227 more in take-home pay annually."
1976,Ford,Republican,Hardworking Americans caught in the middle can really use that kind of extra cash.
1976,Ford,Republican,My recommendations for a firm restraint on the growth of Federal spending and for greater tax reduction are simple and straightforward.
1976,Ford,Republican,"For every dollar saved in cutting the growth in the Federal budget, we can have an added dollar of Federal tax reduction."
1976,Ford,Republican,We can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of Federal spending.
1976,Ford,Republican,One test of a healthy economy is a job for every American who wants to work.
1976,Ford,Republican,Government--our kind of government--cannot create that many jobs.
1976,Ford,Republican,But the Federal Government can create conditions and incentives for private business and industry to make more and more jobs.
1976,Ford,Republican,Five out of six jobs in this country are in private business and in industry.
1976,Ford,Republican,Common sense tells us this is the place to look for more jobs and to find them faster.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I mean real, rewarding, permanent jobs."
1976,Ford,Republican,To achieve this we must offer the American people greater incentives to invest in the future.
1976,Ford,Republican,My tax proposals are a major step in that direction.
1976,Ford,Republican,"To supplement these proposals, I ask that Congress enact changes in Federal tax laws that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new equipment."
1976,Ford,Republican,My recommendations will concentrate this job-creation tax incentive in areas where the unemployment rate now runs over 7 percent.
1976,Ford,Republican,Legislation to get this started must be approved at the earliest possible date.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Within the strict budget total that I will recommend for the coming year, I will ask for additional housing assistance for 500,000 families."
1976,Ford,Republican,"These programs will expand housing opportunities, spur construction, and help to house moderate- and low-income families."
1976,Ford,Republican,We had a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975.
1976,Ford,Republican,"But with lower interest rates and available mortgage money, we can have a healthy recovery in 1976."
1976,Ford,Republican,A necessary condition of a healthy economy is freedom from the petty tyranny of massive government regulation.
1976,Ford,Republican,We are wasting literally millions of working hours costing billions of taxpayers' and consumers' dollars because of bureaucratic redtape.
1976,Ford,Republican,"The American farmer, who now feeds 215 million Americans, but also millions worldwide, has shown how much more he can produce without the shackles of government control."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Now, we badly need reforms in other key areas in our economy: the airlines, trucking, railroads, and financial institutions."
1976,Ford,Republican,"I have submitted concrete plans in each of these areas, not to help this or that industry, but to foster competition and to bring prices down for the consumer."
1976,Ford,Republican,"This administration, in addition, will strictly enforce the Federal antitrust laws for the very same purposes."
1976,Ford,Republican,Taking a longer look ail and gas is still declining.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Our dependence on foreign oil at high prices is still too great, draining jobs and dollars away from our own economy at the rate of $125 per year for every American."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Last month, I signed a compromise national energy bill which enacts a part of my comprehensive energy independence program."
1976,Ford,Republican,"This legislation was late, not the complete answer to energy independence, but still a start in the right direction."
1976,Ford,Republican,I again urge the Congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my energy proposals to make America invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel.
1976,Ford,Republican,"My proposals, as all of you know, would reduce domestic natural gas shortages; allow production from Federal petroleum reserves; stimulate effective conservation, including revitalization of our railroads and the expansion of our urban transportation systems; develop more and cleaner energy from our vast coal resources; expedite clean and safe nuclear power production; create a new national energy independence authority to stimulate vital energy investment; and accelerate development of technology to capture energy from the Sun and the Earth for this and future generations."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Also, I ask, for the sake of future generations, that we preserve the family farm and family-owned small business."
1976,Ford,Republican,Both strengthen America and give stability to our economy.
1976,Ford,Republican,I will propose estate tax changes so that family businesses and family farms can be handed down from generation to generation without having to be sold to pay taxes.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I propose tax changes to encourage people to invest in America's future, and their own, through a plan that gives moderate-income families income tax benefits if they make long-term investments in common stock in American companies."
1976,Ford,Republican,The Federal Government must and will respond to clear-cut national needs--for this and future generations.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Hospital and medical services in America are among the best in the world, but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a family's lifetime savings."
1976,Ford,Republican,Increasing health costs are of deep concern to all and a powerful force pushing up the cost of living.
1976,Ford,Republican,The burden of catastrophic illness can be borne by very few in our society.
1976,Ford,Republican,We must eliminate this fear from every family.
1976,Ford,Republican,I propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody covered by Medicare.
1976,Ford,Republican,"To finance this added protection, fees for short-term care will go up somewhat, but nobody after reaching age 65 will have to pay more than $500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care, nor more than $250 for 1 year's doctor bills."
1976,Ford,Republican,We cannot realistically afford federally dictated national health insurance providing full coverage for all 215 million Americans.
1976,Ford,Republican,The experience of other countries raises questions about the quality as well as the cost of such plans.
1976,Ford,Republican,But I do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer more middle-income families high quality health services at prices they can afford and shield them also from their catastrophic illnesses.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Using resources now available, I propose improving the Medicare and other Federal health programs to help those who really need protection-- older people and the poor."
1976,Ford,Republican,"To help States and local governments give better health care to the poor, I propose that we combine 16 existing Federal programs, including Medicaid, into a single $10 billion Federal grant."
1976,Ford,Republican,Funds would be divided among States under a new formula which provides a larger share of Federal money to those States that have a larger share of low-income families.
1976,Ford,Republican,I will take further steps to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for those who have served in our Armed Forces.
1976,Ford,Republican,Now let me speak about social security.
1976,Ford,Republican,Our Federal social security system for people who have worked and contributed to it for all their lives is a vital part of our economic system.
1976,Ford,Republican,Its value is no longer debatable.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In my budget for fiscal year 1977, I am recommending that the full cost-of-living increases in the social security benefits be paid during the coming year."
1976,Ford,Republican,But I am concerned about the integrity of our Social Security Trust Fund that enables people--those retired and those still working who will retire--to count on this source of retirement income.
1976,Ford,Republican,Younger workers watch their deductions rise and wonder if they will be adequately protected in the future.
1976,Ford,Republican,We must meet this challenge head on.
1976,Ford,Republican,Simple arithmetic warns all of us that the Social Security Trust Fund is headed for trouble.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Unless we act soon to make sure the fund takes in as much as it pays out, there will be no security for old or for young."
1976,Ford,Republican,"I must, therefore, recommend a three-tenths of 1 percent increase in both employer and employee social security taxes effective January 1, 1977."
1976,Ford,Republican,This will cost each covered employee less than 1 extra dollar a week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund.
1976,Ford,Republican,"As we rebuild our economy, we have a continuing responsibility to provide a temporary cushion to the unemployed."
1976,Ford,Republican,"At my request, the Congress enacted two extensions and two expansions in unemployment insurance which helped those who were jobless during 1975."
1976,Ford,Republican,These programs will continue in 1976.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In my fiscal year 1977 budget, I am also requesting funds to continue proven job training and employment opportunity programs for millions of other Americans."
1976,Ford,Republican,Compassion and a sense of community--two of America's greatest strengths throughout our history--tell us we must take care of our neighbors who cannot take care of themselves.
1976,Ford,Republican,The host of Federal programs in this field reflect our generosity as a people.
1976,Ford,Republican,"But everyone realizes that when it comes to welfare, government at all levels is not doing the job well."
1976,Ford,Republican,Too many of our welfare programs are inequitable and invite abuse.
1976,Ford,Republican,Too many of our welfare programs have problems from beginning to end.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Worse, we are wasting badly needed resources without reaching many of the truly needy."
1976,Ford,Republican,Complex welfare programs cannot be reformed overnight.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Surely we cannot simply dump welfare into the laps of the 50 States, their local taxpayers, or their private charities, and just walk away from it."
1976,Ford,Republican,Nor is it the right time for massive and sweeping changes while we are still recovering from the recession.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Nevertheless, there are still plenty of improvements that we can make."
1976,Ford,Republican,I will ask Congress for Presidential authority to tighten up the rules for eligibility and benefits.
1976,Ford,Republican,Last year I twice sought long overdue reform of the scandal-riddled food stamp program.
1976,Ford,Republican,This year I say again: Let's give food stamps to those most in need.
1976,Ford,Republican,Let's not give any to those who don't need them.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Protecting the life and property of the citizen at home is the responsibility of all public officials, but is primarily the job of local and State law enforcement authorities."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Americans have always found the very thought of a Federal police force repugnant, and so do I."
1976,Ford,Republican,But there are proper ways in which we can help to insure domestic tranquility as the Constitution charges us.
1976,Ford,Republican,My recommendations on how to control violent crime were submitted to the Congress last June with strong emphasis on protecting the innocent victims of crime.
1976,Ford,Republican,"To keep a convicted criminal from committing more crimes, we must put him in prison so he cannot harm more law-abiding citizens."
1976,Ford,Republican,"To be effective, this punishment must be swift and it must be certain."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Too often, criminals are not sent to prison after conviction but are allowed to return to the streets."
1976,Ford,Republican,Some judges are reluctant to send convicted criminals to prison because of inadequate facilities.
1976,Ford,Republican,"To alleviate this problem at the Federal level, my new budget proposes the construction of four new Federal facilities."
1976,Ford,Republican,"To speed Federal justice, I propose an increase this year in the United States attorneys prosecuting Federal crimes and the reinforcement of the number of United States marshals."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Additional Federal judges are needed, as recommended by me and the Judicial Conference."
1976,Ford,Republican,Another major threat to every American's person and property is the criminal carrying a handgun.
1976,Ford,Republican,"The way to cut down on the criminal use of guns is not to take guns away from the law-abiding citizen, but to impose mandatory sentences for crimes in which a gun is used, make it harder to obtain cheap guns for criminal purposes, and concentrate gun control enforcement in high-crime areas."
1976,Ford,Republican,My budget recommends 500 additional Federal agents in the 11 largest metropolitan high-crime areas to help local authorities stop criminals from selling and using handguns.
1976,Ford,Republican,The sale of hard drugs is tragically on the increase again.
1976,Ford,Republican,I have directed all agencies of the Federal Government to step up law enforcement efforts against those who deal in drugs.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In 1975, I am glad to report, Federal agents seized substantially more heroin coming into our country than in 1974."
1976,Ford,Republican,"As President, I have talked personally with the leaders of Mexico, Colombia, and Turkey to urge greater efforts by their Governments to control effectively the production and shipment of hard drugs."
1976,Ford,Republican,I recommended months ago that the Congress enact mandatory fixed sentences for persons convicted of Federal crimes involving the sale of hard drugs.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Hard drugs, we all know, degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of their users."
1976,Ford,Republican,It is unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the Federal Government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Under the Constitution, the greatest responsibility for curbing crime lies with State and local authorities."
1976,Ford,Republican,They are the frontline fighters in the war against crime.
1976,Ford,Republican,There are definite ways in which the Federal Government can help them.
1976,Ford,Republican,I will propose in the new budget that Congress authorize almost $7 billion over the next 5 years to assist State and local governments to protect the safety and property of all their citizens.
1976,Ford,Republican,"As President, I pledge the strict enforcement of Federal laws and--by example, support, and leadership--to help State and local authorities enforce their laws."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Together, we must protect the victims of crime and ensure domestic tranquility."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Last year I strongly recommended a 5-year extension of the existing revenue sharing legislation, which thus far has provided $23 1/2 billion to help State and local units of government solve problems at home."
1976,Ford,Republican,This program has been effective with decisionmaking transferred from the Federal Government to locally elected officials.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Congress must act this year, or State and local units of government will have to drop programs or raise local taxes."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Including my health care program reforms, I propose to consolidate some 59 separate Federal programs and provide flexible Federal dollar grants to help States, cities, and local agencies in such important areas as education, child nutrition, and social services."
1976,Ford,Republican,This flexible system will do the job better and do it closer to home.
1976,Ford,Republican,The protection of the lives and property of Americans from foreign enemies is one of my primary responsibilities as President.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In a world of instant communications and intercontinental ballistic missiles, in a world economy that is global and interdependent, our relations with other nations become more, not less, important to the lives of Americans."
1976,Ford,Republican,America has had a unique role in the world since the day of our independence 200 years ago.
1976,Ford,Republican,"And ever since the end of World War II, we have borne--successfully--a heavy responsibility for ensuring a stable world order and hope for human progress."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Today, the state of our foreign policy is sound and strong."
1976,Ford,Republican,"We are at peace, and I will do all in my power to keep it that way."
1976,Ford,Republican,Our military forces are capable and ready.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Our military power is without equal, and I intend to keep it that way."
1976,Ford,Republican,Our principal alliances with the industrial democracies of the Atlantic community and Japan have never been more solid.
1976,Ford,Republican,A further agreement to limit the strategic arms race may be achieved.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We have an improving relationship with China, the world's most populous nation."
1976,Ford,Republican,The key elements for peace among the nations of the Middle East now exist.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Our traditional friendships in Latin America, Africa, and Asia continue."
1976,Ford,Republican,We have taken the role of leadership in launching a serious and hopeful dialog between the industrial world and the developing world.
1976,Ford,Republican,We have helped to achieve significant reform of the international monetary system.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We should be proud of what America, what our country, has accomplished in these areas, and I believe the American people are."
1976,Ford,Republican,"The American people have heard too much about how terrible our mistakes, how evil our deeds, and how misguided our purposes."
1976,Ford,Republican,The American people know better.
1976,Ford,Republican,The truth is we are the world's greatest democracy.
1976,Ford,Republican,We remain the symbol of man's aspiration for liberty and well-being.
1976,Ford,Republican,We are the embodiment of hope for progress.
1976,Ford,Republican,I say it is time we quit downgrading ourselves as a nation.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Of course, it is our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistakes."
1976,Ford,Republican,It is our duty to see that they never happen again.
1976,Ford,Republican,But our greater duty is to look to the future.
1976,Ford,Republican,The world's troubles will not go away.
1976,Ford,Republican,The American people want strong and effective international and defense policies.
1976,Ford,Republican,"In our constitutional system, these policies should reflect consultation and accommodation between the President and the Congress."
1976,Ford,Republican,"But in the final analysis, as the framers of our Constitution knew from hard experience, the foreign relations of the United States can be conducted effectively only if there is strong central direction that allows flexibility of action."
1976,Ford,Republican,That responsibility clearly rests with the President.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I pledge to the American people policies which seek a secure, just, and peaceful world."
1976,Ford,Republican,I pledge to the Congress to work with you to that end.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We must not face a future in which we can no longer help our friends, such as Angola, even in limited and carefully controlled ways."
1976,Ford,Republican,We must not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Some hasty actions of the Congress during the past year--most recently in respect to Angola--were, in my view, very shortsighted."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Unfortunately, they are still very much on the minds of our allies and our adversaries."
1976,Ford,Republican,A strong defense posture gives weight to our values and our views in international negotiations.
1976,Ford,Republican,It assures the vigor of our alliances.
1976,Ford,Republican,And it sustains our efforts to promote settlements of international conflicts.
1976,Ford,Republican,Only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arms.
1976,Ford,Republican,Only a balanced agreement will serve our interests and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation.
1976,Ford,Republican,The defense budget I will submit to the Congress for fiscal year 1977 will show an essential increase over the current year.
1976,Ford,Republican,"It provides for real growth in purchasing power over this year's defense budget, which includes the cost of the all-volunteer force."
1976,Ford,Republican,We are continuing to make economies to enhance the efficiency of our military forces.
1976,Ford,Republican,But the budget I will submit represents the necessity of American strength for the real world in which we live.
1976,Ford,Republican,"As conflict and rivalry persist in the world, our United States intelligence capabilities must be the best in the world."
1976,Ford,Republican,The crippling of our foreign intelligence services increases the danger of American involvement in direct armed conflict.
1976,Ford,Republican,Our adversaries are encouraged to attempt new adventures while our own ability to monitor events and to influence events short of military action is undermined.
1976,Ford,Republican,"Without effective intelligence capability, the United States stands blindfolded and hobbled."
1976,Ford,Republican,"In the near future, I will take actions to reform and strengthen our intelligence community."
1976,Ford,Republican,I ask for your positive cooperation.
1976,Ford,Republican,"It is time to go beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective, responsible, and responsive intelligence capability."
1976,Ford,Republican,Tonight I have spoken about our problems at home and abroad.
1976,Ford,Republican,I have recommended policies that will meet the challenge of our third century.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I have no doubt that our Union will endure, better, stronger, and with more individual freedom."
1976,Ford,Republican,"We can see forward only dimly--1 year, 5 years, a generation perhaps."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Like our forefathers, we know that if we meet the challenges of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction, if we remain true to our Constitution and to our ideals, then we can know that the future will be better than the past."
1976,Ford,Republican,"I see America today crossing a threshold, not just because it is our Bicentennial but because we have been tested in adversity."
1976,Ford,Republican,We have taken a new look at what we want to be and what we want our Nation to become.
1976,Ford,Republican,"I see America resurgent, certain once again that life will be better for our children than it is for us, seeking strength that cannot be counted in megatons and riches that cannot be eroded by inflation."
1976,Ford,Republican,I see these United States of America moving forward as before toward a more perfect Union where the government serves and the people rule.
1976,Ford,Republican,"We will not make this happen simply by making speeches, good or bad, yours or mine, but by hard work and hard decisions made with courage and with common sense."
1976,Ford,Republican,"I have heard many inspiring Presidential speeches, but the words I remember best were spoken by Dwight D."
1976,Ford,Republican,"Eisenhower. ""America is not good because it is great,"" the President said. ""America is great because it is good."" President Eisenhower was raised in a poor but religious home in the heart of America."
1976,Ford,Republican,"His simple words echoed President Lincoln's eloquent testament that ""right makes might."" And Lincoln in turn evoked the silent image of George Washington kneeling in prayer at Valley Forge."
1976,Ford,Republican,"So, all these magic memories which link eight generations of Americans are summed up in the inscription just above me."
1976,Ford,Republican,"How many times have we seen it? ""In God We Trust."" Let us engrave it now in each of our hearts as we begin our Bicentennial."
1977,Ford,Republican,PRESIDENT GERALD R.
1977,Ford,Republican,"FORD'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS REPORTING ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 12, 1977 Mr."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Vice President, Members of the 95th Congress, and distinguished guests: In accordance with the Constitution, I come before you once again to report on the state of the Union."
1977,Ford,Republican,"This report will be my last--maybe--[laughter]--but for the Union it is only the first of such reports in our third century of independence, the close of which none of us will ever see."
1977,Ford,Republican,"We can be confident, however, that 100 years from now a freely elected President will come before a freely elected Congress chosen to renew our great Republic's pledge to the Government of the people, by the people, and for the people."
1977,Ford,Republican,"For my part I pray the third century we are beginning will bring to all Americans, our children and their children's children, a greater measure of individual equality, opportunity, and justice, a greater abundance of spiritual and material blessings, and a higher quality of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
1977,Ford,Republican,"The state of the Union is a measurement of the many elements of which it is composed--a political union of diverse States, an economic union of varying interests, an intellectual union of common convictions, and a moral union of immutable ideals."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Taken in sum, I can report that the state of the Union is good."
1977,Ford,Republican,"There is room for improvement, as always, but today we have a more perfect Union than when my stewardship began."
1977,Ford,Republican,"As a people we discovered that our Bicentennial was much more than a celebration of the past; it became a joyous reaffirmation of all that it means to be Americans, a confirmation before all the world of the vitality and durability of our free institutions."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I am proud to have been privileged to preside over the affairs of our Federal Government during these eventful years when we proved, as I said in my first words upon assuming office, that ""our Constitution works; our great Republic is a Government of laws and not of men."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Here the people rule."" The people have spoken; they have chosen a new President and a new Congress to work their will."
1977,Ford,Republican,I congratulate you--particularly the new Members--as sincerely as I did President-elect Carter.
1977,Ford,Republican,In a few days it will be his duty to outline for you his priorities and legislative recommendations.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Tonight I will not infringe on that responsibility, but rather wish him the very best in all that is good for our country."
1977,Ford,Republican,"During the period of my own service in this Capitol and in the White House, I can recall many orderly transitions of governmental responsibility--of problems as well as of position, of burdens as well as of power."
1977,Ford,Republican,The genius of the American system is that we do this so naturally and so normally.
1977,Ford,Republican,"There are no soldiers marching in the street except in the Inaugural Parade; no public demonstrations except for some of the dancers at the Inaugural Ball; the opposition party doesn't go underground, but goes on functioning vigorously in the Congress and in the country; and our vigilant press goes right on probing and publishing our faults and our follies, confirming the wisdom of the framers of the first amendment."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Because of the transfer of authority in our form of government affects the state of the Union and of the world, I am happy to report to you that the current transition is proceeding very well."
1977,Ford,Republican,I was determined that it should; I wanted the new President to get off on an easier start than I had.
1977,Ford,Republican,"When I became President on August 9, 1974, our Nation was deeply divided and tormented."
1977,Ford,Republican,In rapid succession the Vice President and the President had resigned in disgrace.
1977,Ford,Republican,"We were still struggling with the after-effects of a long, unpopular, and bloody war in Southeast Asia."
1977,Ford,Republican,The economy was unstable and racing toward the worst recession in 40 years.
1977,Ford,Republican,People were losing jobs.
1977,Ford,Republican,The cost of living was soaring.
1977,Ford,Republican,The Congress and the Chief Executive were at loggerheads.
1977,Ford,Republican,The integrity of our constitutional process and other institutions was being questioned.
1977,Ford,Republican,"For more than 15 years domestic spending had soared as Federal programs multiplied, and the expense escalated annually."
1977,Ford,Republican,During the same period our national security needs were steadily shortchanged.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In the grave situation which prevailed in August 1974, our will to maintain our international leadership was in doubt."
1977,Ford,Republican,I asked for your prayers and went to work.
1977,Ford,Republican,In January 1975 I reported to the Congress that the state of the Union was not good.
1977,Ford,Republican,I proposed urgent action to improve the economy and to achieve energy independence in 10 years.
1977,Ford,Republican,I reassured America's allies and sought to reduce the danger of confrontation with potential adversaries.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I pledged a new direction for America. 1975 was a year of difficult decisions, but Americans responded with realism, common sense, and self-discipline."
1977,Ford,Republican,"By January 1976 we were headed in a new direction, which I hold to be the right direction for a free society."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It was guided by the belief that successful problemsolving requires more than Federal action alone, that it involves a full partnership among all branches and all levels of government and public policies which nurture and promote the creative energies of private enterprises, institutions, and individual citizens."
1977,Ford,Republican,A year ago I reported that the state of the Union was better--in many ways a lot better--but still not good enough.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Common sense told me to stick to the steady course we were on, to continue to restrain the inflationary growth of government, to reduce taxes as well as spending, to return local decisions to local officials, to provide for long-range sufficiency in energy and national security needs."
1977,Ford,Republican,I resisted the immense pressures of an election year to open the floodgates of Federal money and the temptation to promise more than I could deliver.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I told it as it was to the American people and demonstrated to the world that in our spirited political competition, as in this chamber, Americans can disagree without being disagreeable."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Now, after 30 months as your President, I can say that while we still have a way to go, I am proud of the long way we have come together."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I am proud of the part I have had in rebuilding confidence in the Presidency, confidence in our free system, and confidence in our future."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Once again, Americans believe in themselves, in their leaders, and in the promise that tomorrow holds for their children."
1977,Ford,Republican,I am proud that today America is at peace.
1977,Ford,Republican,None of our sons are fighting and dying in battle anywhere in the world.
1977,Ford,Republican,And the chance for peace among all nations is improved by our determination to honor our vital commitments in defense of peace and freedom.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I am proud that the United States has strong defenses, strong alliances, and a sound and courageous foreign policy."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Our alliances with major partners, the great industrial democracies of Western Europe, Japan, and Canada, have never been more solid."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Consultations on mutual security, defense, and East-West relations have grown closer."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Collaboration has branched out into new fields such as energy, economic policy, and relations with the Third World."
1977,Ford,Republican,"We have used many avenues for cooperation, including summit meetings held among major allied countries."
1977,Ford,Republican,"The friendship of the democracies is deeper, warmer, and more effective than at any time in 30 years."
1977,Ford,Republican,We are maintaining stability in the strategic nuclear balance and pushing back the specter of nuclear war.
1977,Ford,Republican,A decisive step forward was taken in the Vladivostok Accord which I negotiated with General Secretary Brezhnev--joint recognition that an equal ceiling should be placed on the number of strategic weapons on each side.
1977,Ford,Republican,"With resolve and wisdom on the part of both nations, a good agreement is well within reach this year."
1977,Ford,Republican,The framework for peace in the Middle East has been built.
1977,Ford,Republican,Hopes for future progress in the Middle East were stirred by the historic agreements we reached and the trust and confidence that we formed.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Thanks to American leadership, the prospects for peace in the Middle East are brighter than they have been in three decades."
1977,Ford,Republican,The Arab states and Israel continue to look to us to lead them from confrontation and war to a new era of accommodation and peace.
1977,Ford,Republican,"We have no alternative but to persevere, and I am sure we will."
1977,Ford,Republican,"The opportunities for a final settlement are great, and the price of failure is a return to the bloodshed and hatred that for too long have brought tragedy to all of the peoples of this area and repeatedly edged the world to the brink of war."
1977,Ford,Republican,Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is proving its importance and its durability.
1977,Ford,Republican,We are finding more and more common ground between our two countries on basic questions of international affairs.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In my two trips to Asia as President, we have reaffirmed America's continuing vital interest in the peace and security of Asia and the Pacific Basin, established a new partnership with Japan, confirmed our dedication to the security of Korea, and reinforced our ties with the free nations of Southeast Asia."
1977,Ford,Republican,An historic dialog has begun between industrial nations and developing nations.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Most proposals on the table are the initiatives of the United States, including those on food, energy, technology, trade, investment, and commodities."
1977,Ford,Republican,We are well launched on this process of shaping positive and reliable economic relations between rich nations and poor nations over the long term.
1977,Ford,Republican,We have made progress in trade negotiations and avoided protectionism during recession.
1977,Ford,Republican,We strengthened the international monetary system.
1977,Ford,Republican,During the past 2 years the free world's most important economic powers have already brought about important changes that serve both developed and developing economies.
1977,Ford,Republican,"The momentum already achieved must be nurtured and strengthened, for the prosperity of the rich and poor depends upon it."
1977,Ford,Republican,"In Latin America, our relations have taken on a new maturity and a sense of common enterprise."
1977,Ford,Republican,"In Africa the quest for peace, racial justice, and economic progress is at a crucial point."
1977,Ford,Republican,"The United States, in close cooperation with the United Kingdom, is actively engaged in this historic process."
1977,Ford,Republican,Will change come about by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention?
1977,Ford,Republican,"Or will it come about by negotiated and fair solutions, ensuring majority rule, minority rights, and economic advance?"
1977,Ford,Republican,"America is committed to the side of peace and justice and to the principle that Africa should shape its own future, free of outside intervention."
1977,Ford,Republican,American leadership has helped to stimulate new international efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to shape a comprehensive treaty governing the use of oceans.
1977,Ford,Republican,I am gratified by these accomplishments.
1977,Ford,Republican,They constitute a record of broad success for America and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind.
1977,Ford,Republican,This administration leaves to its successor a world in better condition than we found.
1977,Ford,Republican,"We leave, as well, a solid foundation for progress on a range of issues that are vital to the well-being of America."
1977,Ford,Republican,What has been achieved in the field of foreign affairs and what can be accomplished by the new administration demonstrate the genius of Americans working together for the common good.
1977,Ford,Republican,"It is this, our remarkable ability to work together, that has made us a unique nation."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It is Congress, the President, and the people striving for a better world."
1977,Ford,Republican,I know all patriotic Americans want this Nation's foreign policy to succeed.
1977,Ford,Republican,I urge members of my party in this Congress to give the new President loyal support in this area.
1977,Ford,Republican,I express the hope that this new Congress will reexamine its constitutional role in international affairs.
1977,Ford,Republican,"The exclusive right to declare war, the duty to advise and consent on the part of the Senate, the power of the purse on the part of the House are ample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously guarded."
1977,Ford,Republican,"But because we may have been too careless of these powers in the past does not justify congressional intrusion into, or obstruction of, the proper exercise of Presidential responsibilities now or in the future."
1977,Ford,Republican,There can be only one Commander in Chief.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In these times crises cannot be managed and wars cannot be waged by committee, nor can peace be pursued solely by parliamentary debate."
1977,Ford,Republican,"To the ears of the world, the President speaks for the Nation."
1977,Ford,Republican,"While he is, of course, ultimately accountable to the Congress, the courts, and the people, he and his emissaries must not be handicapped in advance in their relations with foreign governments as has sometimes happened in the past."
1977,Ford,Republican,At home I am encouraged by the Nation's recovery from the recession and our steady return to sound economic growth.
1977,Ford,Republican,"It is now continuing after the recent period of uncertainty, which is part of the price we pay for free elections."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Our most pressing need today and the future is more jobs-- productive, permanent jobs created by a thriving economy."
1977,Ford,Republican,We must revise our tax system both to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the investment necessary for the creation of productive jobs for all Americans who want to work.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Earlier this month I proposed a permanent income tax reduction of $10 billion below current levels, including raising the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I also recommended a series of measures to stimulate investment, such as accelerated depreciation for new plants and equipment in areas of high unemployment, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 48 to 46 percent, and eliminating the present double taxation of dividends."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I strongly urge the Congress to pass these measures to help create the productive, permanent jobs in the private economy that are so essential for our future."
1977,Ford,Republican,All the basic trends are good; we are not on the brink of another recession or economic disaster.
1977,Ford,Republican,"If we follow prudent policies that encourage productive investment and discourage destructive inflation, we will come out on top, and I am sure we will."
1977,Ford,Republican,We have successfully cut inflation by more than half.
1977,Ford,Republican,"When I took office, the Consumer Price Index was rising at 12.2 percent a year."
1977,Ford,Republican,During 1976 the rate of inflation was 5 percent.
1977,Ford,Republican,We have created more jobs--over 4 million more jobs today than in the spring of 1975.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Throughout this Nation today we have over 88 million people in useful, productive jobs--more than at any other time in our Nation's history."
1977,Ford,Republican,But there are still too many Americans unemployed.
1977,Ford,Republican,This is the greatest regret that I have as I leave office.
1977,Ford,Republican,"We brought about with the Congress, after much delay, the renewal of the general revenue sharing."
1977,Ford,Republican,We expanded community development and Federal manpower programs.
1977,Ford,Republican,We began a significant urban mass transit program.
1977,Ford,Republican,Federal programs today provide more funds for our States and local governments than ever before--$70 billion for the current fiscal year.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Through these programs and others that provide aid directly to individuals, we have kept faith with our tradition of compassionate help for those who need it."
1977,Ford,Republican,As we begin our third century we can be proud of the progress that we have made in meeting human needs for all of our citizens.
1977,Ford,Republican,We have cut the growth of crime by nearly 90 percent.
1977,Ford,Republican,Two years ago crime was increasing at the rate of 18 percent annually.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In the first three quarters of 1976, that growth rate had been cut to 2 percent."
1977,Ford,Republican,"But crime, and the fear of crime, remains one of the most serious problems facing our citizens."
1977,Ford,Republican,"We have had some successes, and there have been some disappointments."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Bluntly, I must remind you that we have not made satisfactory progress toward achieving energy independence."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Energy is absolutely vital to the defense of our country, to the strength of our economy, and to the quality of our lives."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Two years ago I proposed to the Congress the first comprehensive national energy program--a specific and coordinated set of measures that would end our vulnerability to embargo, blockade, or arbitrary price increases and would mobilize U.S. technology and resources to supply a significant share of the free world's energy after 1985."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Of the major energy proposals I submitted 2 years ago, only half, belatedly, became law."
1977,Ford,Republican,In 1973 we were dependent upon foreign oil imports for 36 percent of our needs.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Today, we are 40-percent dependent, and we'll pay out $34 billion for foreign oil this year."
1977,Ford,Republican,Such vulnerability at present or in the future is intolerable and must be ended.
1977,Ford,Republican,The answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today reminds me of the old argument about whether the tank is half full or half empty.
1977,Ford,Republican,The pessimist will say we have half failed to achieve our 10-year energy goals; the optimist will say that we have half succeeded.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I am always an optimist, but we must make up for lost time."
1977,Ford,Republican,We have laid a solid foundation for completing the enormous task which confronts us.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I have signed into law five major energy bills which contain significant measures for conservation, resource development, stockpiling, and standby authorities."
1977,Ford,Republican,"We have moved forward to develop the naval petroleum reserves; to build a 500-million barrel strategic petroleum stockpile; to phase out unnecessary Government allocation and price controls; to develop a lasting relationship with other oil consuming nations; to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in automobiles, buildings, and industry; and to expand research on new technology and renewable resources such as wind power, geothermal and solar energy."
1977,Ford,Republican,"All these actions, significant as they are for the long term, are only the beginning."
1977,Ford,Republican,I recently submitted to the Congress my proposals to reorganize the Federal energy structure and the hard choices which remain if we are serious about reducing our dependence upon foreign energy.
1977,Ford,Republican,These include programs to reverse our declining production of natural gas and increase incentives for domestic crude oil production.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I proposed to minimize environmental uncertainties affecting coal development, expand nuclear power generation, and create an energy independence authority to provide government financial assistance for vital energy programs where private capital is not available."
1977,Ford,Republican,We must explore every reasonable prospect for meeting our energy needs when our current domestic reserves of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the next decade.
1977,Ford,Republican,I urgently ask Congress and the new administration to move quickly on these issues.
1977,Ford,Republican,"This Nation has the resources and the capability to achieve our energy goals if its Government has the will to proceed, and I think we do."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I have been disappointed by inability to complete many of the meaningful organizational reforms which I contemplated for the Federal Government, although a start has been made."
1977,Ford,Republican,"For example, the Federal judicial system has long served as a model for other courts."
1977,Ford,Republican,But today it is threatened by a shortage of qualified Federal judges and an explosion of litigation claiming Federal jurisdiction.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I commend to the new administration and the Congress the recent report and recommendations of the Department of Justice, undertaken at my request, on ""the needs of the Federal Courts."" I especially endorse its proposals for a new commission on the judicial appointment process."
1977,Ford,Republican,"While the judicial branch of our Government may require reinforcement, the budgets and payrolls of the other branches remain staggering."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I cannot help but observe that while the White House staff and the Executive Office of the President have been reduced and the total number of civilians in the executive branch contained during the 1970's, the legislative branch has increased substantially although the membership of the Congress remains at 535."
1977,Ford,Republican,Congress now costs the taxpayers more than a million dollars per Member; the whole legislative budget has passed the billion dollar mark.
1977,Ford,Republican,"I set out to reduce the growth in the size and spending of the Federal Government, but no President can accomplish this alone."
1977,Ford,Republican,"The Congress sidetracked most of my requests for authority to consolidate overlapping programs and agencies, to return more decisionmaking and responsibility to State and local governments through block grants instead of rigid categorical programs, and to eliminate unnecessary redtape and outrageously complex regulations."
1977,Ford,Republican,"We have made some progress in cutting back the expansion of government and its intrusion into individual lives, but believe me, there is much more to be done--and you and I know it."
1977,Ford,Republican,It can only be done by tough and temporarily painful surgery by a Congress as prepared as the President to face up to this very real political problem.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Again, I wish my successor, working with a substantial majority of his own party, the best of success in reforming the costly and cumbersome machinery of the Federal Government."
1977,Ford,Republican,The task of self-government is never finished.
1977,Ford,Republican,The problems are great; the opportunities are greater.
1977,Ford,Republican,America's first goal is and always will be peace with honor.
1977,Ford,Republican,America must remain first in keeping peace in the world.
1977,Ford,Republican,We can remain first in peace only if we are never second in defense.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In presenting the state of the Union to the Congress and to the American people, I have a special obligation as Commander in Chief to report on our national defense."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Our survival as a free and independent people requires, above all, strong military forces that are well equipped and highly trained to perform their assigned mission."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I am particularly gratified to report that over the past 2 1/2 years, we have been able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in real resources this country was devoting to national defense."
1977,Ford,Republican,This was an immediate problem I faced in 1974.
1977,Ford,Republican,The evidence was unmistakable that the Soviet Union had been steadily increasing the resources it applied to building its military strength.
1977,Ford,Republican,During this same period the United States real defense spending declined.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In my three budgets we not only arrested that dangerous decline, but we have established the positive trend which is essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world."
1977,Ford,Republican,"The Vietnam war, both materially and psychologically, affected our overall defense posture."
1977,Ford,Republican,The dangerous antimilitary sentiment discouraged defense spending and unfairly disparaged the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces.
1977,Ford,Republican,"The challenge that now confronts this country is whether we have the national will and determination to continue this essential defense effort over the long term, as it must be continued."
1977,Ford,Republican,"We can no longer afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter; indeed, we have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budgets and to examine the nature of the problem we will face over the next generation."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I am the first recent President able to address long-term, basic issues without the burden of Vietnam."
1977,Ford,Republican,The war in Indo-china consumed enormous resources at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority we once enjoyed was disappearing.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In past years, as a result of decisions by the United States, our strategic forces leveled off, yet the Soviet Union continued a steady, constant buildup of its own forces, committing a high percentage of its national economic effort to defense."
1977,Ford,Republican,The United States can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against us or even a situation where the American people or our allies believe the balance is shifting against us.
1977,Ford,Republican,The United States would risk the most serious political consequences if the world came to believe that our adversaries have a decisive margin of superiority.
1977,Ford,Republican,To maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the 1980's and beyond.
1977,Ford,Republican,The sophistication of modern weapons requires that we make decisions now if we are to ensure our security 10 years from now.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Therefore, I have consistently advocated and strongly urged that we pursue three critical strategic programs: the Trident missile launching submarine; the B-1 bomber, with its superior capability to penetrate modern air defenses; and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that will be better able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastating retaliatory strike."
1977,Ford,Republican,"In an era where the strategic nuclear forces are in rough equilibrium, the risks of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more perilous."
1977,Ford,Republican,"A major, long-term objective, therefore, is to maintain capabilities to deal with, and thereby deter, conventional challenges and crises, particularly in Europe."
1977,Ford,Republican,We cannot rely solely on strategic forces to guarantee our security or to deter all types of aggression.
1977,Ford,Republican,"We must have superior naval and marine forces to maintain freedom of the seas, strong multipurpose tactical air forces, and mobile, modern ground forces."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Accordingly, I have directed a long-term effort to improve our worldwide capabilities to deal with regional crises."
1977,Ford,Republican,I have submitted a 5-year naval building program indispensable to the Nation's maritime strategy.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Because the security of Europe and the integrity of NATO remain the cornerstone of American defense policy, I have initiated a special, long-term program to ensure the capacity of the Alliance to deter or defeat aggression in Europe."
1977,Ford,Republican,As I leave office I can report that our national defense is effectively deterring conflict today.
1977,Ford,Republican,Our Armed Forces are capable of carrying out the variety of missions assigned to them.
1977,Ford,Republican,Programs are underway which will assure we can deter war in the years ahead.
1977,Ford,Republican,But I also must warn that it will require a sustained effort over a period of years to maintain these capabilities.
1977,Ford,Republican,"We must have the wisdom, the stamina, and the courage to prepare today for the perils of tomorrow, and I believe we will."
1977,Ford,Republican,"As I look to the future--and I assure you I intend to go on doing that for a good many years--I can say with confidence that the state of the Union is good, but we must go on making it better and better."
1977,Ford,Republican,"This gathering symbolizes the constitutional foundation which makes continued progress possible, synchronizing the skills of three independent branches of Government, reserving fundamental sovereignty to the people of this great land."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It is only as the temporary representatives and servants of the people that we meet here, we bring no hereditary status or gift of infallibility, and none follows us from this place."
1977,Ford,Republican,"Like President Washington, like the more fortunate of his successors, I look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude."
1977,Ford,Republican,"To me, being a citizen of the United States of America is the greatest honor and privilege in this world."
1977,Ford,Republican,"From the opportunities which fate and my fellow citizens have given me, as a Member of the House, as Vice President and President of the Senate, and as President of all the people, I have come to understand and place the highest value on the checks and balances which our founders imposed on government through the separation of powers among co-equal legislative, executive, and judicial branches."
1977,Ford,Republican,"This often results in difficulty and delay, as I well know, but it also places supreme authority under God, beyond any one person, any one branch, any majority great or small, or any one party."
1977,Ford,Republican,The Constitution is the bedrock of all our freedoms.
1977,Ford,Republican,"Guard and cherish it, keep honor and order in your own house, and the Republic will endure."
1977,Ford,Republican,It is not easy to end these remarks.
1977,Ford,Republican,"In this Chamber, along with some of you, I have experienced many, many of the highlights of my life."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It was here that I stood 28 years ago with my freshman colleagues, as Speaker Sam Rayburn administered the oath."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I see some of you now-- Charlie Bennett, Dick Bolling, Carl Perkins, Pete Rodino, Harley Staggers, Tom Steed, Sid Yates, Clem Zablocki--and I remember those who have gone to their rest."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It was here we waged many, many a lively battle--won some, lost some, but always remaining friends."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It was here, surrounded by such friends, that the distinguished Chief Justice swore me in as Vice President on December 6, 1973."
1977,Ford,Republican,"It was here I returned 8 months later as your President to ask not for a honeymoon, but for a good marriage."
1977,Ford,Republican,"I will always treasure those memories and your many, many kindnesses."
1977,Ford,Republican,I thank you for them all.
1977,Ford,Republican,"My fellow Americans, I once asked you for your prayers, and now I give you mine: May God guide this wonderful country, its people, and those they have chosen to lead them."
1977,Ford,Republican,"May our third century be illuminated by liberty and blessed with brotherhood, so that we and all who come after us may be the humble servants of thy peace."
1977,Ford,Republican,Amen.
1977,Ford,Republican,Good night.
1977,Ford,Republican,God bless you.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER'S ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION Two years ago today we had the first caucus in Iowa, and one year ago tomorrow, I walked from here to the White House to take up the duties of President of the United States."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I didn't know it then when I walked, but I've been trying to save energy ever since."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I return tonight to fulfill one of those duties of the Constitution: to give to the Congress, and to the Nation, information on the state of the Union."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Militarily, politically, economically, and in spirit, the state of our Union is sound."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We are a great country, a strong country, a vital and dynamic country, and so we will remain."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We are a confident people and a hardworking people, a decent and a compassionate people, and so we will remain."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I want to speak to you tonight about where we are and where we must go, about what we have done and what we must do."
1978,Carter,Democratic,And I want to pledge to you my best efforts and ask you to pledge yours.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Each generation of Americans has to face circumstances not of its own choosing, but by which its character is measured and its spirit is tested."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"There are times of emergency, when a nation and its leaders must bring their energies to bear on a single urgent task."
1978,Carter,Democratic,That was the duty Abraham Lincoln faced when our land was torn apart by conflict in the War Between the States.
1978,Carter,Democratic,That was the duty faced by Franklin Roosevelt when he led America out of an economic depression and again when he led America to victory in war.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"There are other times when there is no single overwhelming crisis, yet profound national interests are at stake."
1978,Carter,Democratic,At such times the risk of inaction can be equally great.
1978,Carter,Democratic,It becomes the task of leaders to call forth the vast and restless energies of our people to build for the future.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"That is what Harry Truman did in the years after the Second World War, when we helped Europe and Japan rebuild themselves and secured an international order that has protected freedom from aggression."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We live in such times now, and we face such duties."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We've come through a long period of turmoil and doubt, but we've once again found our moral course, and with a new spirit, we are striving to express our best instincts to the rest of the world."
1978,Carter,Democratic,There is all across our land a growing sense of peace and a sense of common purpose.
1978,Carter,Democratic,This sense of unity cannot be expressed in programs or in legislation or in dollars.
1978,Carter,Democratic,It's an achievement that belongs to every individual American.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"This unity ties together, and it towers over all our efforts here in Washington, and it serves as an inspiring beacon for all of us who are elected to serve."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"This new atmosphere demands a new spirit, a partnership between those of us who lead and those who elect."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The foundations of this partnership are truth, the courage to face hard decisions, concern for one another and the common good over special interests, and a basic faith and trust in the wisdom and strength and judgment of the American people."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"For the first time in a generation, we are not haunted by a major international crisis or by domestic turmoil, and we now have a rare and a priceless opportunity to address persistent problems and burdens which come to us as a nation, quietly and steadily getting worse over the years."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"As President, I've had to ask you, the Members of Congress, and you, the American people, to come to grips with some of the most difficult and hard questions facing our society."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We must make a maximum effort, because if we do not aim for the best, we are very likely to achieve little."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I see no benefit to the country if we delay, because the problems will only get worse."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We need patience and good will, but we really need to realize that there is a limit to the role and the function of government."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Government cannot solve our problems, it can't set our goals, it cannot define our vision."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Government cannot eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or reduce inflation or save our cities or cure illiteracy or provide energy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And government cannot mandate goodness.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Only a true partnership between government and the people can ever hope to reach these goals.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Those of us who govern can sometimes inspire, and we can identify needs and marshal resources, but we simply cannot be the managers of everything and everybody."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We here in Washington must move away from crisis management, and we must establish clear goals for the future, immediate and the distant future, which will let us work together and not in conflict."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Never again should we neglect a growing crisis like the shortage of energy, where further delay will only lead to more harsh and painful solutions."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Every day we spend more than $120 million for foreign oil.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"This slows our economic growth, it lowers the value of the dollar overseas, and it aggravates unemployment and inflation here at home."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now we know what we must do, increase production."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We must cut down on waste.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And we must use more of those fuels which are plentiful and more permanent.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We must be fair to people, and we must not disrupt our Nation's economy and our budget."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now, that sounds simple."
1978,Carter,Democratic,But I recognize the difficulties involved.
1978,Carter,Democratic,I know that it is not easy for the Congress to act.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"But the fact remains that on the energy legislation, we have failed the American people."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Almost 5 years after the oil embargo dramatized the problem for us all, we still do not have a national energy program."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Not much longer can we tolerate this stalemate.
1978,Carter,Democratic,It undermines our national interest both at home and abroad.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We must succeed, and I believe we will."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Our main task at home this year, with energy a central element, is the Nation's economy."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We must continue the recovery and further cut unemployment and inflation.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Last year was a good one for the United States.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We reached all of our major economic goals for 1977.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Four million new jobs were created, an alltime record, and the number of unemployed dropped by more than a million."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Unemployment right now is the lowest it has been since 1974, and not since World War II has such a high percentage of American people been employed."
1978,Carter,Democratic,The rate of inflation went down.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"There was a good growth in business profits and investments, the source of more jobs for our workers, and a higher standard of living for all our people."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"After taxes and inflation, there was a healthy increase in workers' wages."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"And this year, our country will have the first $2 trillion economy in the history of the world."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now, we are proud of this progress the first year, but we must do even better in the future."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We still have serious problems on which all of us must work together.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Our trade deficit is too large.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Inflation is still too high, and too many Americans still do not have a job."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now, I didn't have any simple answers for all these problems."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"But we have developed an economic policy that is working, because it's simple, balanced, and fair."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"It's based on four principles: First, the economy must keep on expanding to produce new jobs and better income, which our people need."
1978,Carter,Democratic,The fruits of growth must be widely shared.
1978,Carter,Democratic,More jobs must be made available to those who have been bypassed until now.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And the tax system must be made fairer and simpler.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Secondly, private business and not the Government must lead the expansion in the future."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Third, we must lower the rate of inflation and keep it down."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Inflation slows down economic growth, and it's the most cruel to the poor and also to the elderly and others who live on fixed incomes."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"And fourth, we must contribute to the strength of the world economy."
1978,Carter,Democratic,I will announce detailed proposals for improving our tax system later this week.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We can make our tax laws fairer, we can make them simpler and easier to understand, and at the same time, we can, and we will, reduce the tax burden on American citizens by $25 billion."
1978,Carter,Democratic,The tax reforms and the tax reductions go together.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Only with the long overdue reforms will the full tax cut be advisable.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Almost $17 billion in income tax cuts will go to individuals.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Ninety-six percent of all American taxpayers will see their taxes go down.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"For a typical family of four, this means an annual saving of more than $250 a year, or a tax reduction of about 20 percent."
1978,Carter,Democratic,A further $2 billion cut in excise taxes will give more relief and also contribute directly to lowering the rate of inflation.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And we will also provide strong additional incentives for business investment and growth through substantial cuts in the corporate tax rates and improvement in the investment tax credit.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now, these tax proposals will increase opportunity everywhere in the Nation."
1978,Carter,Democratic,But additional jobs for the disadvantaged deserve special attention.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We've already passed laws to assure equal access to the voting booth and to restaurants and to schools, to housing, and laws to permit access to jobs."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"But job opportunity, the chance to earn a decent living, is also a basic human right, which we cannot and will not ignore."
1978,Carter,Democratic,A major priority for our Nation is the final elimination of the barriers that restrict the opportunities available to women and also to black people and Hispanics and other minorities.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've come a long way toward that goal.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But there is still much to do.
1978,Carter,Democratic,What we inherited from the past must not be permitted to shackle us in the future.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I'll be asking you for a substantial increase in funds for public jobs for our young people, and I also am recommending that the Congress continue the public service employment programs at more than twice the level of a year ago."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"When welfare reform is completed, we will have more than a million additional jobs so that those on welfare who are able to work can work."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"However, again, we know that in our free society, private business is still the best source of new jobs."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Therefore, I will propose a new program to encourage businesses to hire young and disadvantaged Americans."
1978,Carter,Democratic,These young people only need skills and a chance in order to take their place in our economic system.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Let's give them the chance they need.
1978,Carter,Democratic,A major step in the right direction would be the early passage of a greatly improved Humphrey-Hawkins bill.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"My budget for 1979 addresses these national needs, but it is lean and tight."
1978,Carter,Democratic,I have cut waste wherever possible.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I am proposing an increase of less than 2 percent after adjusting for inflation, the smallest increase in the Federal budget in 4 years."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Lately, Federal spending has taken a steadily increasing portion of what Americans produce."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Our new budget reverses that trend, and later I hope to bring the Government's toll down even further."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"And with your help, we'll do that."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In time of high employment and a strong economy, deficit spending should not be a feature of our budget."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"As the economy continues to gain strength and as our unemployment rates continue to fall, revenues will grow."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"With careful planning, efficient management, and proper restraint on spending, we can move rapidly toward a balanced budget, and we will."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Next year the budget deficit will be only slightly less than this year.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But one-third of the deficit is due to the necessary tax cuts that I've proposed.
1978,Carter,Democratic,This year the right choice is to reduce the burden on taxpayers and provide more jobs for our people.
1978,Carter,Democratic,The third element in our program is a renewed attack on inflation.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've learned the hard way that high unemployment will not prevent or cure inflation.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Government can help us by stimulating private investment and by maintaining a responsible economic policy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Through a new top-level review process, we will do a better job of reducing Government regulation that drives up costs and drives up prices."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"But again, Government alone cannot bring down the rate of inflation."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"When a level of high inflation is expected to continue, then companies raise prices to protect their profit margins against prospective increases in wages and other costs, while workers demand higher wages as protection against expected price increases."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"It's like an escalation in the arms race, and understandably, no one wants to disarm alone."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now, no one firm or a group of workers can halt this process."
1978,Carter,Democratic,It's an effort that we must all make together.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I'm therefore asking government, business, labor, and other groups to join in a voluntary program to moderate inflation by holding wage and price increases in each sector of the economy during 1978 below the average increases of the last 2 years."
1978,Carter,Democratic,I do not believe in wage and price controls.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"A sincere commitment to voluntary constraint provides a way, perhaps the only way, to fight inflation without Government interference."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"As I came into the Capitol tonight, I saw the farmers, my fellow farmers, standing out in the snow."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I'm familiar with their problem, and I know from Congress' action that you are too."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"When I was running Carters Warehouse, we had spread on our own farms 5-10-15 fertilizer for about $40 a ton."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The last time I was home, the price was about $100 a ton."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The cost of nitrogen has gone up 150 percent, and the price of products that farmers sell has either stayed the same or gone down a little."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Now, this past year in 1977, you, the Congress, and I together passed a new agricultural act."
1978,Carter,Democratic,It went into effect October 1.
1978,Carter,Democratic,It'll have its first impact on the 1978 crops.
1978,Carter,Democratic,It will help a great deal.
1978,Carter,Democratic,It'll add $6 1/2 billion or more to help the farmers with their price supports and target prices.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Last year we had the highest level of exports of farm products in the history of our country, $24 billion."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We expect to have more this year.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We'll be working together.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But I think it's incumbent on us to monitor very carefully the farm situation and continue to work harmoniously with the farmers of our country.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"What's best for the farmers, the farm families, in the long run is also best for the consumers of our country."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Economic success at home is also the key to success in our international economic policy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"An effective energy program, strong investment and productivity, and controlled inflation will provide [improve] our trade balance and balance it, and it will help to protect the integrity of the dollar overseas."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"By working closely with our friends abroad, we can promote the economic health of the whole world, with fair and balanced agreements lowering the barriers to trade."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Despite the inevitable pressures that build up when the world economy suffers from high unemployment, we must firmly resist the demands for self-defeating protectionism."
1978,Carter,Democratic,But free trade must also be fair trade.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And I am determined to protect American industry and American workers against foreign trade practices which are unfair or illegal.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In a separate written message to Congress, I've outlined other domestic initiatives, such as welfare reform, consumer protection, basic education skills, urban policy, reform of our labor laws, and national health care later on this year."
1978,Carter,Democratic,I will not repeat these tonight.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But there are several other points that I would like to make directly to you.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"During these past years, Americans have seen our Government grow far from us."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"For some citizens, the Government has almost become like a foreign country, so strange and distant that we've often had to deal with it through trained ambassadors who have sometimes become too powerful and too influential, lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists."
1978,Carter,Democratic,This cannot go on.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We must have what Abraham Lincoln wanted, a government for the people."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've made progress toward that kind of government.
1978,Carter,Democratic,You've given me the authority I requested to reorganize the Federal bureaucracy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And I am using that authority.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've already begun a series of reorganization plans which will be completed over a period of 3 years.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We have also proposed abolishing almost 500 Federal advisory and other commissions and boards.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But I know that the American people are still sick and tired of Federal paperwork and redtape.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Bit by bit we are chopping down the thicket of unnecessary Federal regulations by which Government too often interferes in our personal lives and our personal business.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've cut the public's Federal paperwork load by more than 12 percent in less than a year.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And we are not through cutting.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've made a good start on turning the gobbledygook of Federal regulations into plain English that people can understand.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But we know that we still have a long way to go.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've brought together parts of 11 Government agencies to create a new Department of Energy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,And now it's time to take another major step by creating a separate Department of Education.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But even the best organized Government will only be as effective as the people who carry out its policies.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"For this reason, I consider civil service reform to be absolutely vital."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Worked out with the civil servants themselves, this reorganization plan will restore the merit principle to a system which has grown into a bureaucratic maze."
1978,Carter,Democratic,It will provide greater management flexibility and better rewards for better performance without compromising job security.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Then and only then can we have a government that is efficient, open, and truly worthy of our people's understanding and respect."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"I have promised that we will have such a government, and I intend to keep that promise."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In our foreign policy, the separation of people from government has been in the past a source of weakness and error."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In a democratic system like ours, foreign policy decisions must be able to stand the test of public examination and public debate."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"If we make a mistake in this administration, it will be on the side of frankness and openness with the American people."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In our modern world, when the deaths of literally millions of people can result from a few terrifying seconds of destruction, the path of national strength and security is identical to the path of peace."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Tonight, I am happy to report that because we are strong, our Nation is at peace with the world."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We are a confident nation.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We've restored a moral basis for our foreign policy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,The very heart of our identity as a nation is our firm commitment to human rights.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We stand for human rights because we believe that government has as a purpose to promote the well-being of its citizens.
1978,Carter,Democratic,This is true in our domestic policy; it's also true in our foreign policy.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The world must know that in support of human rights, the United States will stand firm."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We expect no quick or easy results, but there has been significant movement toward greater freedom and humanity in several parts of the world."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Thousands of political prisoners have been freed.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The leaders of the world, even our ideological adversaries, now see that their attitude toward fundamental human rights affects their standing in the international community, and it affects their relations with the United States."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"To serve the interests of every American, our foreign policy has three major goals."
1978,Carter,Democratic,The first and prime concern is and will remain the security of our country.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Security is based on our national will, and security is based on the strength of our Armed Forces."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We have the will, and militarily we are very strong."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Security also comes through the strength of our alliances.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We have reconfirmed our commitment to the defense of Europe, and this year we will demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthening our military capabilities there."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Security can also be enhanced by agreements with potential adversaries which reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintaining our own relative strategic capability.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In areas of peaceful competition with the Soviet Union, we will continue to more than hold our own."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"At the same time, we are negotiating with quiet confidence, without haste, with careful determination, to ease the tensions between us and to ensure greater stability and security."
1978,Carter,Democratic,The strategic arms limitation talks have been long and difficult.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We want a mutual limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant nuclear arsenals of both nations, and then we want actual reductions in strategic arms as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"If these talks result in an agreement this year, and I trust they will, I pledge to you that the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of the world's strategic balance and the security of the United States."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"For 30 years, concerted but unsuccessful efforts have been made to ban the testing of atomic explosives, both military weapons and peaceful nuclear devices."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We are hard at work with Great Britain and the Soviet Union on an agreement which will stop testing and will protect our national security and provide for adequate verification of compliance.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We are now making, I believe, good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We are also working vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world which do not now have them and to reduce the deadly global traffic in conventional arms sales.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Our stand for peace is suspect if we are also the principal arms merchant of the world.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"So, we've decided to cut down our arms transfers abroad on a year-by-year basis and to work with other major arms exporters to encourage their similar constraint."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Every American has a stake in our second major goal, a world at peace."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In a nuclear age, each of us is threatened when peace is not secured everywhere."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We are trying to promote harmony in those parts of the world where major differences exist among other nations and threaten international peace.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In the Middle East, we are contributing our good offices to maintain the momentum of the current negotiations and to keep open the lines of communication among the Middle Eastern leaders."
1978,Carter,Democratic,The whole world has a great stake in the success of these efforts.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"This is a precious opportunity for a historic settlement of a longstanding conflict, an opportunity which may never come again in our lifetime."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Our role has been difficult and sometimes thankless and controversial.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"But it has been constructive and it has been necessary, and it will continue."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Our third major foreign policy goal is one that touches the life of every American citizen every day, world economic growth and stability."
1978,Carter,Democratic,This requires strong economic performance by the industrialized democracies like ourselves and progress in resolving the global energy crisis.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Last fall, with the help of others, we succeeded in our vigorous efforts to maintain the stability of the price of oil."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"But as many foreign leaders have emphasized to me personally and, I am sure, to you, the greatest future contribution that America can make to the world economy would be an effective energy conservation program here at home."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We will not hesitate to take the actions needed to protect the integrity of the American dollar.
1978,Carter,Democratic,We are trying to develop a more just international system.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"And in this spirit, we are supporting the struggle for human development in Africa, in Asia, and in Latin America."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Finally, the world is watching to see how we act on one of our most important and controversial items of business, approval of the Panama Canal treaties."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The treaties now before the Senate are the result of the work of four administrations, two Democratic, two Republican."
1978,Carter,Democratic,They guarantee that the canal will be open always for unrestricted use by the ships of the world.
1978,Carter,Democratic,Our ships have the right to go to the head of the line for priority of passage in times of emergency or need.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We retain the permanent right to defend the canal with our own military forces, if necessary, to guarantee its openness and its neutrality."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The treaties are to the clear advantage of ourselves, the Panamanians, and the other users of the canal."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Ratifying the Panama Canal treaties will demonstrate our good faith to the world, discourage the spread of hostile ideologies in this hemisphere, and directly contribute to the economic well-being and the security of the United States."
1978,Carter,Democratic,I have to say that that's very welcome applause.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"There were two moments on my recent journey which, for me, confirmed the final aims of our foreign policy and what it always must be."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"One was in a little village in India, where I met a people as passionately attached to their rights and liberties as we are, but whose children have a far smaller chance for good health or food or education or human fulfillment than a child born in this country."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"The other moment was in Warsaw, capital of a nation twice devastated by war in this century."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"There, people have rebuilt the city which war's destruction took from them."
1978,Carter,Democratic,But what was new only emphasized clearly what was lost.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"What I saw in those two places crystalized for me the purposes of our own Nation's policy: to ensure economic justice, to advance human rights, to resolve conflicts without violence, and to proclaim in our great democracy our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human beings everywhere."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We Americans have a great deal of work to do together.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"In the end, how well we do that work will depend on the spirit in which we approach it."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We must seek fresh answers, unhindered by the stale prescriptions of the past."
1978,Carter,Democratic,It has been said that our best years are behind us.
1978,Carter,Democratic,But I say again that America's best is still ahead.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We have emerged from bitter experiences chastened but proud, confident once again, ready to face challenges once again, and united once again."
1978,Carter,Democratic,We come together tonight at a solemn time.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Last week the Senate lost a good and honest man, Lee Metcalf of Montana."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"And today, the flag of the United States flew at half-mast from this Capitol and from American installations and ships all over the world, in mourning for Senator Hubert Humphrey."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Because he exemplified so well the joy and the zest of living, his death reminds us not so much of our own mortality, but of the possibilities offered to us by life."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"He always looked to the future with a special American kind of confidence, of hope and enthusiasm."
1978,Carter,Democratic,And the best way that we can honor him is by following his example.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Our task, to use the words of Senator Humphrey, is ""reconciliation, rebuilding, and rebirth."" Reconciliation of private needs and interests into a higher purpose."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Rebuilding the old dreams of justice and liberty, and country and community."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Rebirth of our faith in the common good.
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Each of us here tonight, and all who are listening in your homes, must rededicate ourselves to serving the common good."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"We are a community, a beloved community, all of us."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"Our individual fates are linked, our futures intertwined."
1978,Carter,Democratic,"And if we act in that knowledge and in that spirit, together, as the Bible says, we can move mountains."
1978,Carter,Democratic,Thank you very much.
1979,Carter,Democratic,PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER'S ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION Tonight I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union--how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Our children who will be born this year will come of age in the 21st century.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"What kind of society, what kind of world are we building for them?"
1979,Carter,Democratic,Will we ourselves be at peace?
1979,Carter,Democratic,Will our children enjoy a better quality of life?
1979,Carter,Democratic,Will a strong and united America still be a force for freedom and prosperity around the world?
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Tonight, there is every sign that the state of our Union is sound."
1979,Carter,Democratic,Our economy offers greater prosperity for more of our people than ever before.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Real per capita income and real business profits have risen substantially in the last 2 years.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Farm exports are setting an all-time record each year, and farm income last year, net farm income, was up more than 25 percent."
1979,Carter,Democratic,Our liberties are secure.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Our military defenses are strong and growing stronger.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And more importantly, tonight, America--our beloved country--is at peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Our earliest national commitments, modified and reshaped by succeeding generations, have served us well."
1979,Carter,Democratic,But the problems that we face today are different from those that confronted earlier generations of Americans.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"They are more subtle, more complex, and more interrelated."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"At home, we are recognizing ever more clearly that government alone cannot solve these problems."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And abroad, few of them can be solved by the United States alone."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"But Americans as a united people, working with our allies and friends, have never been afraid to face problems and to solve problems, either here or abroad."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The challenge to us is to build a new and firmer foundation for the future--for a sound economy, for a more effective government, for more political trust, and for a stable peace--so that the America our children inherit will be even stronger and even better than it is today."
1979,Carter,Democratic,We cannot resort to simplistic or extreme solutions which substitute myths for common sense.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In our economy, it is a myth that we must choose endlessly between inflation and recession."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Together, we build the foundation for a strong economy, with lower inflation, without contriving either a recession with its high unemployment or unworkable, mandatory government controls."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In our government, it is a myth that we must choose between compassion and competence."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Together, we build the foundation for a government that works, and works for people."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In our relations with our potential adversaries, it is a myth that we must choose between confrontation and capitulation."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Together, we build the foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Together, we've already begun to build the foundation for confidence in our economic system."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"During the last 2 years, in bringing our economy out of the deepest recession since the 1930's, we've created 7,100,000 new jobs."
1979,Carter,Democratic,The unemployment rate has gone down 25 percent.
1979,Carter,Democratic,And now we must redouble our fight against the persistent inflation that has wracked our country for more than a decade.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"That's our important domestic issue, and we must do it together."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We know that inflation is a burden for all Americans, but it's a disaster for the poor, the sick, and the old."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"No American family should be forced to choose among food, warmth, health care, or decent housing because the cost of any of these basic necessities has climbed out of reach."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Three months ago, I outlined to the Nation a balanced anti-inflation program that couples responsible government restraint with responsible wage and price restraint."
1979,Carter,Democratic,It's based upon my knowledge that there is a more powerful force than government compulsion--the force created by the cooperative efforts of millions of Americans working toward a common goal.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Business and labor have been increasingly supportive.
1979,Carter,Democratic,It's imperative that we in government do our part.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We must stop excessive government growth, and we must control government spending habits."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"I've sent to this Congress a stringent but a fair budget, one that, since I ran for President in 1976, will have cut the Federal deficit in half."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And as a percentage of our gross national product, the deficit will have dropped by almost 75 percent."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"This Congress had a good record last year, and I now ask the 96th Congress to continue this partnership in holding the line on excess Federal spending."
1979,Carter,Democratic,It will not be easy.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"But we must be strong, and we must be persistent."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"This budget is a clear message that, with the help of you and the American people, I am determined, as President, to bring inflation under control."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The 1980 budget provides enough spending restraint to begin unwinding inflation, but enough support for our country to keep American workers productive and to encourage the investments that provide new jobs."
1979,Carter,Democratic,We will continue to mobilize our Nation's resources to reduce our trade deficit substantially this year and to maintain the strength of the American dollar.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We've demonstrated in this restrained budget that we can build on the gains of the past 2 years to provide additional support to educate disadvantaged children, to care for the elderly, to provide nutrition and legal services for the poor, and to strengthen the economic base of our urban communities and, also, our rural areas."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"This year, we will take our first steps to develop a national health plan."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We must never accept a permanent group of unemployed Americans, with no hope and no stake in building our society."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"For those left out of the economy because of discrimination, a lack of skills, or poverty, we must maintain high levels of training, and we must continue to provide jobs."
1979,Carter,Democratic,A responsible budget is not our only weapon to control inflation.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We must act now to protect all Americans from health care costs that are rising $1 million per hour, 24 hours a day, doubling every 5 years."
1979,Carter,Democratic,We must take control of the largest contributor to that inflation: skyrocketing hospital costs.
1979,Carter,Democratic,There will be no clearer test of the commitment of this Congress to the anti-inflation fight than the legislation that I will submit again this year to hold down inflation in hospital care.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Over the next 5 years, my proposals will save Americans a total of $60 billion, of which $25 billion will be savings to the American taxpayer in the Federal budget itself."
1979,Carter,Democratic,The American people have waited long enough.
1979,Carter,Democratic,This year we must act on hospital cost containment.
1979,Carter,Democratic,We must also fight inflation by improvements and better enforcement of our antitrust laws and by reducing government obstacles to competition in the private sector.
1979,Carter,Democratic,We must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our economy.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Through deregulation of the airline industry we've increased profits, cut prices for all Americans, and begun--for one of the few times in the history of our Nation--to actually dismantle a major Federal bureaucracy."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"This year, we must begin the effort to reform our regulatory processes for the railroad, bus, and the trucking industries."
1979,Carter,Democratic,America has the greatest economic system in the world.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Let's reduce government interference and give it a chance to work.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"I call on Congress to take other anti-inflation action--to expand our exports to protect American jobs threatened by unfair trade, to conserve energy, to increase production and to speed development of solar power, and to reassess our Nation's technological superiority."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"American workers who enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our gratitude, but they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance proposal that I have already made to the Congress."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"To be successful, we must change our attitudes as well as our policies."
1979,Carter,Democratic,We cannot afford to live beyond our means.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We cannot afford to create programs that we can neither manage nor finance, or to waste our natural resources, and we cannot tolerate mismanagement and fraud."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Above all, we must meet the challenges of inflation as a united people."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"With the support of the American people, government in recent decades has helped to dismantle racial barriers, has provided assistance for the jobless and the retired, has fed the hungry, has protected the safety, health, and bargaining rights of American workers, and has helped to preserve our natural heritage."
1979,Carter,Democratic,But it's not enough to have created a lot of government programs.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Now we must make the good programs more effective and improve or weed out those which are wasteful or unnecessary.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"With the support of the Congress, we've begun to reorganize and to get control of the bureaucracy."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We are reforming the civil service system, so that we can recognize and reward those who do a good job and correct or remove those who do not."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"This year, we must extend major reorganization efforts to education, to economic development, and to the management of our natural resources."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We need to enact a sunshine [sunset] law that when government programs have outlived their value, they will automatically be terminated."
1979,Carter,Democratic,There's no such thing as an effective and a noncontroversial reorganization and reform.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"But we know that honest, effective government is essential to restore public faith in our public action."
1979,Carter,Democratic,None of us can be satisfied when two-thirds of the American citizens chose not to vote last year in a national election.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Too many Americans feel powerless against the influence of private lobbying groups and the unbelievable flood of private campaign money which threatens our electoral process.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"This year, we must regain the public's faith by requiring limited financial funds from public funds for congressional election campaigns."
1979,Carter,Democratic,House bill 1 provides for this public financing of campaigns.
1979,Carter,Democratic,And I look forward with a great deal of anticipation to signing it at an early date.
1979,Carter,Democratic,A strong economy and an effective government will restore confidence in America.
1979,Carter,Democratic,But the path of the future must be charted in peace.
1979,Carter,Democratic,We must continue to build a new and a firm foundation for a stable world community.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We are building that new foundation from a position of national strength--the strength of our own defenses, the strength of our friendships with other nations, and of our oldest American ideals."
1979,Carter,Democratic,America's military power is a major force for security and stability in the world.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We must maintain our strategic capability and continue the progress of the last 2 years with our NATO Allies, with whom we have increased our readiness, modernized our equipment, and strengthened our defense forces in Europe."
1979,Carter,Democratic,I urge you to support the strong defense budget which I have proposed to the Congress.
1979,Carter,Democratic,But our national security in this complicated age requires more than just military might.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In less than a lifetime, world population has more than doubled, colonial empires have disappeared, and a hundred new nations have been born, and migration to the world's cities have all awakened new yearnings for economic justice and human rights among people everywhere."
1979,Carter,Democratic,This demand for justice and human rights is a wave of the future.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In such a world, the choice is not which super power will dominate the world."
1979,Carter,Democratic,None can and none will.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The choice instead is between a world of anarchy and destruction, or a world of cooperation and peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In such a world, we seek not to stifle inevitable change, but to influence its course in helpful and constructive ways that enhance our values, our national interests, and the cause of peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Towering over this volatile, changing world, like a thundercloud on a summer day, looms the awesome power of nuclear weapons."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We will continue to help shape the forces of change, to anticipate emerging problems of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms sales, and to use our great strength parts of the world before they erupt and spread."
1979,Carter,Democratic,We have no desire to be the world's policeman.
1979,Carter,Democratic,But America does want to be the world's peacemaker.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We are building the foundation for truly global cooperation, not only with Western and industrialized nations but with the developing countries as well."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Our ties with Japan and our European allies are stronger than ever, and so are our friendly relations with the people of Latin America, Africa, and the Western Pacific and Asia."
1979,Carter,Democratic,We've won new respect in this hemisphere with the Panama Canal treaties.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We've gained new trust with the developing world through our opposition to racism, our commitment to human rights, and our support for majority rule in Africa."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The multilateral trade negotiations are now reaching a successful conclusion, and congressional approval is essential to the economic well-being of our own country and of the world."
1979,Carter,Democratic,This will be one of our top priorities in 1979.
1979,Carter,Democratic,We are entering a hopeful era in our relations with one-fourth of the world's people who live in China.
1979,Carter,Democratic,The presence of Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping next week will help to inaugurate that new era.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And with prompt congressional action on authorizing legislation, we will continue our commitment to a prosperous, peaceful, and secure life for the people of Taiwan."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"I'm grateful that in the past year, as in the year before, no American has died in combat anywhere in the world."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And in Iran, Nicaragua, Cyprus, Namibia, and Rhodesia, our country is working for peaceful solutions to dangerous conflicts."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In the Middle East, under the most difficult circumstances, we have sought to help ancient enemies lay aside deep-seated differences that have produced four bitter wars in our lifetime."
1979,Carter,Democratic,Our firm commitment to Israel's survival and security is rooted in our deepest convictions and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our own Nation of a stable Middle East.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"To promote peace and reconciliation in the region, we must retain the trust and the confidence both of Israel and also of the Arab nations that are sincerely searching for peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"I am determined, as President, to use the full, beneficial influence of our country so that the precious opportunity for lasting peace between Israel and Egypt will not be lost."
1979,Carter,Democratic,The new foundation of international cooperation that we seek excludes no nation.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Cooperation with the Soviet Union serves the cause of peace, for in this nuclear age, world peace must include peace between the super powers--and it must mean the control of nuclear arms."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Ten years ago, the United States and the Soviet Union made the historic decision to open the strategic arms limitations talks, or SALT."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The purpose of SALT, then as now, is not to gain a unilateral advantage for either nation, but to protect the security of both nations, to reverse the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arms race, to preserve a stable balance of nuclear forces, and to demonstrate to a concerned world that we are determined to help preserve the peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,The first SALT agreement was concluded in 1972.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And since then, during 6 years of negotiation by both Republican and Democratic leaders, nearly all issues of SALT II have been resolved."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"If the Soviet Union continues to negotiate in good faith, a responsible SALT agreement will be reached."
1979,Carter,Democratic,It's important that the American people understand the nature of the SALT process.
1979,Carter,Democratic,SALT II is not based on sentiment; it's based on self-interest-- of the United States and of the Soviet Union.
1979,Carter,Democratic,Both nations share a powerful common interest in reducing the threat of a nuclear war.
1979,Carter,Democratic,I will sign no agreement which does not enhance our national security.
1979,Carter,Democratic,SALT II does not rely on trust; it will be verifiable.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We have very sophisticated, proven means, including our satellites, to determine for ourselves whether or not the Soviet Union is meeting its treaty obligations."
1979,Carter,Democratic,I will sign no agreement which cannot be verified.
1979,Carter,Democratic,The American nuclear deterrent will remain strong after SALT II.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"For example, just one of our relatively invulnerable Poseidon submarines--comprising less than 2 percent of our total nuclear force of submarines, aircraft, and land-based missiles--carries enough warheads to destroy every large- and medium-sized city in the Soviet Union."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Our deterrent is ovewhelming, and I will sign no agreement unless our deterrent force will remain overwhelming."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"A SALT agreement, of course, cannot substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense, nor will it end the danger of nuclear war."
1979,Carter,Democratic,But it will certainly reduce that danger.
1979,Carter,Democratic,It will strengthen our efforts to ban nuclear tests and to stop the spread of atomic weapons to other nations.
1979,Carter,Democratic,And it can begin the process of negotiating new agreements which will further limit nuclear arms.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The path of arms control, backed by a strong defense, the path our Nation and every President has walked for 30 years, can lead to a world of law and of international negotiation and consultation in which all peoples might live in peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"In this year 1979, nothing is more important than that the Congress and the people of the United States resolve to continue with me on that path of nuclear arms control and world peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,This is paramount.
1979,Carter,Democratic,I've outlined some of the changes that have transformed the world and which are continuing as we meet here tonight.
1979,Carter,Democratic,But we in America need not fear change.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The values on which our Nation was founded: individual liberty, self-determination, the potential for human fulfillment in freedom, all of these endure."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We find these democratic principles praised, even in books smuggled out of totalitarian nations and on wallposters in lands which we thought were closed to our influence."
1979,Carter,Democratic,Our country has regained its special place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human rights.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"And that is a commitment that we must keep at home, as well as abroad."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The civil rights revolution freed all Americans, black and white, but its full promise still remains unrealized."
1979,Carter,Democratic,I will continue to work with all my strength for equal opportunity for all Americans--and for affirmative action for those who carry the extra burden of past denial of equal opportunity.
1979,Carter,Democratic,We remain committed to improving our labor laws to better protect the rights of American workers.
1979,Carter,Democratic,And our Nation must make it clear that the legal rights of women as citizens are guaranteed under the laws of our land by ratifying the equal rights amendment.
1979,Carter,Democratic,"As long as I'm President, at home and around the world America's examples and America's influence will be marshaled to advance the cause of human rights."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"To establish those values, two centuries ago a bold generation of Americans risked their property, their position, and life itself."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"We are their heirs, and they are sending us a message across the centuries."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The words they made so vivid are now growing faintly indistinct, because they are not heard often enough."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"They are words like ""justice,"" ""equality,"" ""unity,"" ""truth,"" ""sacrifice,"" ""liberty,"" ""faith,"" and ""love."" These words remind us that the duty of our generation of Americans is to renew our Nation's faith, not focused just against foreign threats but against the threats of selfishness, cynicism, and apathy."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"The new foundation I've discussed tonight can help us build a nation and a world where every child is nurtured and can look to the future with hope, where the resources now wasted on war can be turned towards meeting human needs, where all people have enough to eat, a decent home, and protection against disease."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"It can help us build a nation and a world where all people are free to seek the truth and to add to human understanding, so that all of us may live our lives in peace."
1979,Carter,Democratic,"Tonight, I ask you, the Members of the Congress, to join me in building that new foundation, a better foundation, for our beloved country and our world."
1979,Carter,Democratic,Thank you very much.
1980,Carter,Democratic,PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER'S ADDRESS TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION This last few months has not been an easy time for any of us.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"As we meet tonight, it has never been more clear that the state of our Union depends on the state of the world."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"And tonight, as throughout our own generation, freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our Union."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"The 1980's have been born in turmoil, strife, and change."
1980,Carter,Democratic,This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and our skills.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"At this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan."
1980,Carter,Democratic,These two acts--one of international terrorism and one of military aggression--present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Together, we will meet these threats to peace."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"I'm determined that the United States will remain the strongest of all nations, but our power will never be used to initiate a threat to the security of any nation or to the rights of any human being."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We seek to be and to remain secure--a nation at peace in a stable world.
1980,Carter,Democratic,But to be secure we must face the world as it is.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Three basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Each of these factors is important in its own right.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Each interacts with the others.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"All must be faced together, squarely and courageously."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us."
1980,Carter,Democratic,And we will not fail.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"In response to the abhorrent act in Iran, our Nation has never been aroused and unified so greatly in peacetime."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Our position is clear.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The United States will not yield to blackmail.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We continue to pursue these specific goals: first, to protect the present and long-range interests of the United States; secondly, to preserve the lives of the American hostages and to secure, as quickly as possible, their safe release, if possible, to avoid bloodshed which might further endanger the lives of our fellow citizens; to enlist the help of other nations in condemning this act of violence, which is shocking and violates the moral and the legal standards of a civilized world; and also to convince and to persuade the Iranian leaders that the real danger to their nation lies in the north, in the Soviet Union and from the Soviet troops now in Afghanistan, and that the unwarranted Iranian quarrel with the United States hampers their response to this far greater danger to them."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"If the American hostages are harmed, a severe price will be paid."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We will never rest until every one of the American hostages are released.
1980,Carter,Democratic,But now we face a broader and more fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the Soviet Union.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Now, as during the last 3 1/2 decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Since the end of the Second World War, America has led other nations in meeting the challenge of mounting Soviet power."
1980,Carter,Democratic,This has not been a simple or a static relationship.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Between us there has been cooperation, there has been competition, and at times there has been confrontation."
1980,Carter,Democratic,In the 1940's we took the lead in creating the Atlantic Alliance in response to the Soviet Union's suppression and then consolidation of its East European empire and the resulting threat of the Warsaw Pact to Western Europe.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"In the 1950's we helped to contain further Soviet challenges in Korea and in the Middle East, and we rearmed to assure the continuation of that containment."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"In the 1960's we met the Soviet challenges in Berlin, and we faced the Cuban missile crisis."
1980,Carter,Democratic,And we sought to engage the Soviet Union in the important task of moving beyond the cold war and away from confrontation.
1980,Carter,Democratic,And in the 1970's three American Presidents negotiated with the Soviet leaders in attempts to halt the growth of the nuclear arms race.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We sought to establish rules of behavior that would reduce the risks of conflict, and we searched for areas of cooperation that could make our relations reciprocal and productive, not only for the sake of our two nations but for the security and peace of the entire world."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"In all these actions, we have maintained two commitments: to be ready to meet any challenge by Soviet military power, and to develop ways to resolve disputes and to keep the peace."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Preventing nuclear war is the foremost responsibility of the two superpowers.
1980,Carter,Democratic,That's why we've negotiated the strategic arms limitation treaties--SALT I and SALT II.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Especially now, in a time of great tension, observing the mutual constraints imposed by the terms of these treaties will be in the best interest of both countries and will help to preserve world peace."
1980,Carter,Democratic,I will consult very closely with the Congress on this matter as we strive to control nuclear weapons.
1980,Carter,Democratic,That effort to control nuclear weapons will not be abandoned.
1980,Carter,Democratic,We superpowers also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use of our great military force.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The integrity and the independence of weaker nations must not be threatened.
1980,Carter,Democratic,They must know that in our presence they are secure.
1980,Carter,Democratic,But now the Soviet Union has taken a radical and an aggressive new step.
1980,Carter,Democratic,It's using its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The implications of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The vast majority of nations on Earth have condemned this latest Soviet attempt to extend its colonial domination of others and have demanded the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The Moslem world is especially and justifiably outraged by this aggression against an Islamic people.
1980,Carter,Democratic,No action of a world power has ever been so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemned.
1980,Carter,Democratic,But verbal condemnation is not enough.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The Soviet Union must pay a concrete price for their aggression.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"While this invasion continues, we and the other nations of the world cannot conduct business as usual with the Soviet Union."
1980,Carter,Democratic,That's why the United States has imposed stiff economic penalties on the Soviet Union.
1980,Carter,Democratic,I will not issue any permits for Soviet ships to fish in the coastal waters of the United States.
1980,Carter,Democratic,I've cut Soviet access to high-technology equipment and to agricultural products.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"I've limited other commerce with the Soviet Union, and I've asked our allies and friends to join with us in restraining their own trade with the Soviets and not to replace our own embargoed items."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"And I have notified the Olympic Committee that with Soviet invading forces in Afghanistan, neither the American people nor I will support sending an Olympic team to Moscow."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"The Soviet Union is going to have to answer some basic questions: Will it help promote a more stable international environment in which its own legitimate, peaceful concerns can be pursued?"
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Or will it continue to expand its military power far beyond its genuine security needs, and use that power for colonial conquest?"
1980,Carter,Democratic,The Soviet Union must realize that its decision to use military force in Afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it values.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The region which is now threatened by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of great strategic importance: It contains more than two-thirds of the world's exportable oil.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"The Soviet effort to dominate Afghanistan has brought Soviet military forces to within 300 miles of the Indian Ocean and close to the Straits of Hormuz, a waterway through which most of the world's oil must flow."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"The Soviet Union is now attempting to consolidate a strategic position, therefore, that poses a grave threat to the free movement of Middle East oil."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"This situation demands careful thought, steady nerves, and resolute action, not only for this year but for many years to come."
1980,Carter,Democratic,It demands collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian Gulf and in Southwest Asia.
1980,Carter,Democratic,It demands the participation of all those who rely on oil from the Middle East and who are concerned with global peace and stability.
1980,Carter,Democratic,And it demands consultation and close cooperation with countries in the area which might be threatened.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Meeting this challenge will take national will, diplomatic and political wisdom, economic sacrifice, and, of course, military capability."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We must call on the best that is in us to preserve the security of this crucial region.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"During the past 3 years, you have joined with me to improve our own security and the prospects for peace, not only in the vital oil-producing area of the Persian Gulf region but around the world."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We've increased annually our real commitment for defense, and we will sustain this increase of effort throughout the Five Year Defense Program."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"It's imperative that Congress approve this strong defense budget for 1981, encompassing a 5-percent real growth in authorizations, without any reduction."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We are also improving our capability to deploy U.S. military forces rapidly to distant areas.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We've helped to strengthen NATO and our other alliances, and recently we and other NATO members have decided to develop and to deploy modernized, intermediate-range nuclear forces to meet an unwarranted and increased threat from the nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We are working with our allies to prevent conflict in the Middle East.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel is a notable achievement which represents a strategic asset for America and which also enhances prospects for regional and world peace.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We are now engaged in further negotiations to provide full autonomy for the people of the West Bank and Gaza, to resolve the Palestinian issue in all its aspects, and to preserve the peace and security of Israel."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Let no one doubt our commitment to the security of Israel.
1980,Carter,Democratic,In a few days we will observe an historic event when Israel makes another major withdrawal from the Sinai and when Ambassadors will be exchanged between Israel and Egypt.
1980,Carter,Democratic,We've also expanded our own sphere of friendship.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Our deep commitment to human rights and to meeting human needs has improved our relationship with much of the Third World.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Our decision to normalize relations with the People's Republic of China will help to preserve peace and stability in Asia and in the Western Pacific.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We've increased and strengthened our naval presence in the Indian Ocean, and we are now making arrangements for key naval and air facilities to be used by our forces in the region of northeast Africa and the Persian Gulf."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We've reconfirmed our 1959 agreement to help Pakistan preserve its independence and its integrity.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The United States will take action consistent with our own laws to assist Pakistan in resisting any outside aggression.
1980,Carter,Democratic,And I'm asking the Congress specifically to reaffirm this agreement.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"I'm also working, along with the leaders of other nations, to provide additional military and economic aid for Pakistan."
1980,Carter,Democratic,That request will come to you in just a few days.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Finally, we are prepared to work with other countries in the region to share a cooperative security framework that respects differing values and political beliefs, yet which enhances the independence, security, and prosperity of all."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"All these efforts combined emphasize our dedication to defend and preserve the vital interests of the region and of the nation which we represent and those of our allies--in Europe and the Pacific, and also in the parts of the world which have such great strategic importance to us, stretching especially through the Middle East and Southwest Asia."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"With your help, I will pursue these efforts with vigor and with determination."
1980,Carter,Democratic,You and I will act as necessary to protect and to preserve our Nation's security.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The men and women of America's Armed Forces are on duty tonight in many parts of the world.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"I'm proud of the job they are doing, and I know you share that pride."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"I believe that our volunteer forces are adequate for current defense needs, and I hope that it will not become necessary to impose a draft."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"However, we must be prepared for that possibility."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"For this reason, I have determined that the Selective Service System must now be revitalized."
1980,Carter,Democratic,I will send legislation and budget proposals to the Congress next month so that we can begin registration and then meet future mobilization needs rapidly if they arise.
1980,Carter,Democratic,We also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the legal authority and accountability of our intelligence agencies.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We will guarantee that abuses do not recur, but we must tighten our controls on sensitive intelligence information, and we need to remove unwarranted restraints on America's ability to collect intelligence."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"The decade ahead will be a time of rapid change, as nations everywhere seek to deal with new problems and age-old tensions."
1980,Carter,Democratic,But America need have no fear.
1980,Carter,Democratic,We can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to our values and actively engaged in promoting world peace.
1980,Carter,Democratic,We will continue to work as we have for peace in the Middle East and southern Africa.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We will continue to build our ties with developing nations, respecting and helping to strengthen their national independence which they have struggled so hard to achieve."
1980,Carter,Democratic,And we will continue to support the growth of democracy and the protection of human rights.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"In repressive regimes, popular frustrations often have no outlet except through violence."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"But when peoples and their governments can approach their problems together through open, democratic methods, the basis for stability and peace is far more solid and far more enduring."
1980,Carter,Democratic,That is why our support for human rights in other countries is in our own national interest as well as part of our own national character.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Peace--a peace that preserves freedom--remains America's first goal.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"In the coming years, as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace."
1980,Carter,Democratic,But to be strong abroad we must be strong at home.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"And in order to be strong, we must continue to face up to the difficult issues that confront us as a nation today."
1980,Carter,Democratic,The crises in Iran and Afghanistan have dramatized a very important lesson: Our excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger to our Nation's security.
1980,Carter,Democratic,The need has never been more urgent.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"At long last, we must have a clear, comprehensive energy policy for the United States."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"As you well know, I have been working with the Congress in a concentrated and persistent way over the past 3 years to meet this need."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We have made progress together.
1980,Carter,Democratic,But Congress must act promptly now to complete final action on this vital energy legislation.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Our Nation will then have a major conservation effort, important initiatives to develop solar power, realistic pricing based on the true value of oil, strong incentives for the production of coal and other fossil fuels in the United States, and our Nation's most massive peacetime investment in the development of synthetic fuels."
1980,Carter,Democratic,The American people are making progress in energy conservation.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Last year we reduced overall petroleum consumption by 8 percent and gasoline consumption by 5 percent below what it was the year before.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Now we must do more.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"After consultation with the Governors, we will set gasoline conservation goals for each of the 50 States, and I will make them mandatory if these goals are not met."
1980,Carter,Democratic,I've established an import ceiling for 1980 of 8.2 million barrels a day--well below the level of foreign oil purchases in 1977.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"I expect our imports to be much lower than this, but the ceiling will be enforced by an oil import fee if necessary."
1980,Carter,Democratic,I'm prepared to lower these imports still further if the other oil-consuming countries will join us in a fair and mutual reduction.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"If we have a serious shortage, I will not hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline rationing immediately."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"The single biggest factor in the inflation rate last year, the increase in the inflation rate last year, was from one cause: the skyrocketing prices of OPEC oil."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We must take whatever actions are necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oil--and at the same time reduce inflation.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"As individuals and as families, few of us can produce energy by ourselves."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"But all of us can conserve energy--every one of us, every day of our lives."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Tonight I call on you--in fact, all the people of America--to help our Nation."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Conserve energy.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Eliminate waste.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Make 1980 indeed a year of energy conservation.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Of course, we must take other actions to strengthen our Nation's economy."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"First, we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the Federal budget."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Second, as we continue to work with business to hold down prices, we'll build also on the historic national accord with organized labor to restrain pay increases in a fair fight against inflation."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Third, we will continue our successful efforts to cut paperwork and to dismantle unnecessary Government regulation."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Fourth, we will continue our progress in providing jobs for America, concentrating on a major new program to provide training and work for our young people, especially minority youth."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"It has been said that ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste."" We will give our young people new hope for jobs and a better life in the 1980's."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"And fifth, we must use the decade of the 1980's to attack the basic structural weaknesses and problems in our economy through measures to increase productivity, savings, and investment."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"With these energy and economic policies, we will make America even stronger at home in this decade--just as our foreign and defense policies will make us stronger and safer throughout the world."
1980,Carter,Democratic,We will never abandon our struggle for a just and a decent society here at home.
1980,Carter,Democratic,That's the heart of America--and it's the source of our ability to inspire other people to defend their own rights abroad.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Our material resources, great as they are, are limited."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Our problems are too complex for simple slogans or for quick solutions.
1980,Carter,Democratic,We cannot solve them without effort and sacrifice.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Walter Lippmann once reminded us, ""You took the good things for granted."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Now you must earn them again.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"For every right that you cherish, you have a duty which you must fulfill."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"For every good which you wish to preserve, you will have to sacrifice your comfort and your ease."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"There is nothing for nothing any longer."" Our challenges are formidable."
1980,Carter,Democratic,But there's a new spirit of unity and resolve in our country.
1980,Carter,Democratic,"We move into the 1980's with confidence and hope and a bright vision of the America we want: an America strong and free, an America at peace, an America with equal rights for all citizens-- and for women, guaranteed in the United States Constitution--an America with jobs and good health and good education for every citizen, an America with a clean and bountiful life in our cities and on our farms, an America that helps to feed the world, an America secure in filling its own energy needs, an America of justice, tolerance, and compassion."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"For this vision to come true, we must sacrifice, but this national commitment will be an exciting enterprise that will unify our people."
1980,Carter,Democratic,"Together as one people, let us work to build our strength at home, and together as one indivisible union, let us seek peace and security throughout the world."
1980,Carter,Democratic,Together let us make of this time of challenge and danger a decade of national resolve and of brave achievement.
1980,Carter,Democratic,Thank you very much.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE PROGRAM FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY February 18, 1981 Mr."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Only a month ago I was your guest in this historic building, and I pledged to you my cooperation in doing what is right for this Nation that we all love so much."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"I'm here tonight to reaffirm that pledge and to ask that we share in restoring the promise that is offered to every citizen by this, the last, best hope of man on Earth."
1981,Reagan,Republican,All of us are aware of the punishing inflation which has for the first time in 60 years held to double-digit figures for 2 years in a row.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Interest rates have reached absurd levels of more that 20 percent and over 15 percent for those who would borrow to buy a home.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"All across this land one can see newly built homes standing vacant, unsold because of mortgage interest rates."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Almost 8 million Americans are out of work.
1981,Reagan,Republican,These are people who want to be productive.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"But as the months go by, despair dominates their lives."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The threats of layoff and unemployment hang over other millions, and all who work are frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"One worker in a Midwest city put it to me this way: He said, ""I'm bringing home more dollars than I ever believed I could possibly earn, but I seem to be getting worse off."" And he is."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Not only have hourly earnings of the American worker, after adjusting for inflation, declined 5 percent over the past 5 years, but in these 5 years, Federal personal taxes for the average family have increased 67 percent."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We can no longer procrastinate and hope that things will get better.
1981,Reagan,Republican,They will not.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Unless we act forcefully -- and now -- the economy will get worse.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Can we, who man the ship of state, deny it is somewhat out of control?"
1981,Reagan,Republican,Our national debt is approaching $1 trillion.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"A few weeks ago I called such a figure, a trillion dollars, incomprehensible, and I've been trying ever since to think of a way to illustrate how big a trillion really is."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And the best I could come up with is that if you had a stack of thousand-dollar bills in your hand only 4 inches high, you'd be a millionaire."
1981,Reagan,Republican,A trillion dollars would be a stack of thousand-dollar bills 67 miles high.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The interest on the public debt this year we know will be over $90 billion, and unless we change the proposed spending for the fiscal year beginning October 1st, we'll add another almost $80 billion to the debt."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Adding to our troubles is a mass of regulations imposed on the shopkeeper, the farmer, the craftsman, professionals, and major industry that is estimated to add $100 billion to the price of the things we buy, and it reduces our ability to produce."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The rate of increase in American productivity, once one of the highest in the world, is among the lowest of all major industrial nations."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Indeed, it has actually declined in the last 3 years."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, I've painted a pretty grim picture, but I think I've painted it accurately."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"It is within our power to change this picture, and we can act with hope."
1981,Reagan,Republican,There's nothing wrong with our internal strengths.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"There has been no breakdown of the human, technological, and natural resources upon which the economy is built."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Based on this confidence in a system which has never failed us, but which we have failed through a lack of confidence and sometimes through a belief that we could fine-tune the economy and get it tuned to our liking, I am proposing a comprehensive four-point program."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, let me outline in detail some of the principal parts of this program."
1981,Reagan,Republican,You'll each be provided with a completely detailed copy of the entire program.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This plan is aimed at reducing the growth in government spending and taxing, reforming and eliminating regulations which are unnecessary and unproductive or counterproductive, and encouraging a consistent monetary policy aimed at maintaining the value of the currency."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"If enacted in full, this program can help America create 13 million new jobs, nearly 3 million more than we would have without these measures."
1981,Reagan,Republican,It will also help us to gain control of inflation.
1981,Reagan,Republican,It's important to note that we're only reducing the rate of increase in taxing and spending.
1981,Reagan,Republican,We're not attempting to cut either spending or taxing levels below that which we presently have.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This plan will get our economy moving again, [create] productivity growth, and thus create the jobs that our people must have."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And I'm asking that you join me in reducing direct Federal spending by $41.4 billion in fiscal year 1982, and this goes along with another $7.7 billion in user fees and off-budget savings for a total of $49.1 billion."
1981,Reagan,Republican,And this will still allow an increase of $40.8 billion over 1981 spending.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, I know that exaggerated and inaccurate stories about these cuts have disturbed many people, particularly those dependent on grant and benefit programs for their basic needs."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Some of you have heard from constituents, I know, afraid that social security checks, for example, were going to be taken away from them."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I regret the fear that these unfounded stories have caused, and I welcome this opportunity to set things straight."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We will continue to fulfill the obligations that spring from our national conscience.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Those who, through no fault of their own, must depend on the rest of us -- the poverty stricken, the disabled, the elderly, all those with true need -- can rest assured that the social safety net of programs they depend on are exempt from any cuts."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The full retirement benefits of the more than 31 million social security recipients will be continued, along with an annual cost-of-living increase."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Medicare will not be cut, nor will supplemental income for the blind, the aged, and the disabled."
1981,Reagan,Republican,And funding will continue for veterans pensions.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"School breakfasts and lunches for the children of low-income families will continue, as will nutrition and other special services for the aging."
1981,Reagan,Republican,There will be no cut in Project Head Start or summer youth jobs.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"All in all, nearly $216 billion worth of programs providing help for tens of millions of Americans will be fully funded."
1981,Reagan,Republican,But government will not continue to subsidize individuals or particular business interests where real need cannot be demonstrated.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And while we will reduce some subsidies to regional and local governments, we will at the same time convert a number of categorical grant programs into block grants to reduce wasteful administrative overhead and to give local governments and States more flexibility and control."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We call for an end in duplication to Federal programs and reform of those which are not cost-effective.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, already some have protested that there must be no reduction in aid to schools."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Well, let me point out that Federal aid to education amounts to only 8 percent of the total educational funding, and for this 8 percent, the Federal Government has insisted on tremendously disproportionate share of control over our schools."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Whatever reductions we've proposed in that 8 percent will amount to very little in the total cost of education.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"They will, however, restore more authority to States and local school districts."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Historically, the American people have supported by voluntary contributions more artistic and cultural activities than all the other countries in the world put together."
1981,Reagan,Republican,I wholeheartedly support this approach and believe that Americans will continue their generosity.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Therefore, I'm proposing a savings of $85 million in the Federal subsidies now going to the arts and humanities."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"There are a number of subsidies to business and industry that I believe are unnecessary, not because the activities being subsidized aren't of value, but because the marketplace contains incentives enough to warrant continuing these activities without a government subsidy."
1981,Reagan,Republican,One such subsidy is the Department of Energy's synthetic fuels program.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We will continue support of research leading to development of new technologies and more independence from foreign oil, but we can save at least $3.2 billion by leaving to private industry the building of plants to make liquid or gas fuels from coal."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We're asking that another major industry -- business subsidy I should say, the Export-Import Bank loan authority, be reduced by one-third in 1982."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We're doing this because the primary beneficiaries of taxpayer funds in this case are the exporting companies themselves -- most of them profitable corporations.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This brings me to a number of other lending programs in which government makes low-interest loans, some of them at an interest rate as low as 2 percent."
1981,Reagan,Republican,What has not been very well understood is that the Treasury Department has no money of its own to lend; it has to go into the private capital market and borrow the money.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"So, in this time of excessive interest rates, the government finds itself borrowing at an interest rate several times as high as the interest it gets back from those it lends the money to."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And this difference, of course, is paid by your constituents -- the taxpayers."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"They get hit again if they try to borrow, because government borrowing contributes to raising all interest rates."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"By terminating the Economic Development Administration, we can save hundreds of millions of dollars in 1982 and billions more over the next few years."
1981,Reagan,Republican,There's a lack of consistent and convincing evidence that EDA and its Regional Commissions have been effective in creating new jobs.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"They have been effective in creating an array of planners, grantsmen, and professional middlemen."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We believe we can do better just by the expansion of the economy and the job creation which will come from our economic program.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The Food Stamp program will be restored to its original purpose, to assist those without resources to purchase sufficient nutritional food."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We will, however, save $1.8 billion in fiscal year 1982 by removing from eligibility those who are not in real need or who are abusing the program."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"But even with this reduction, the program will be budgeted for more than $10 billion."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We will tighten welfare and give more attention to outside sources of income when determining the amount of welfare that an individual is allowed.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This, plus strong and effective work requirements, will save $520 million in the next year."
1981,Reagan,Republican,I stated a moment ago our intention to keep the school breakfast and lunch programs for those in true need.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"But by cutting back on meals for children of families who can afford to pay, the savings will be $1.6 billion in the fiscal year 1982."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, let me just touch on a few other areas which are typical of the kind of reductions we've included in this economic package."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The Trade Adjustment Assistance program provides benefits for workers who are unemployed when foreign imports reduce the market for various American products, causing shutdown of plants and layoff of workers."
1981,Reagan,Republican,The purpose is to help these workers find jobs in growing sectors of our economy.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"There's nothing wrong with that, but because these benefits are paid out on top of normal unemployment benefits, we wind up paying greater benefits to those who lose their jobs because of foreign competition than we do to their friends and neighbors who are laid off due to domestic competition."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Anyone must agree that this is unfair.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Putting these two programs on the same footing will save $1.15 billion in just 1 year.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Earlier I made mention of changing categorical grants to States and local governments into block grants.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, we know of course that the categorical grant programs burden local and State governments with a mass of Federal regulations and Federal paperwork."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Ineffective targeting, wasteful administrative overhead -- all can be eliminated by shifting the resources and decisionmaking authority to local and State government."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This will also consolidate programs which are scattered throughout the Federal bureaucracy, bringing government closer to the people and saving $23.9 billion over the next 5 years."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Our program for economic renewal deals with a number of programs which at present are not cost-effective.
1981,Reagan,Republican,An example is Medicaid.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Right now Washington provides the States with unlimited matching payments for their expenditures; at the same time, we here in Washington pretty much dictate how the States are going to manage those programs."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We want to put a cap on how much the Federal Government will contribute, but at the same time allow the States much more flexibility in managing and structuring the programs."
1981,Reagan,Republican,I know from our experience in California that such flexibility could have led to far more cost-effective reforms.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, this will bring a savings of $1 billion next year."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The space program has been and is important to America, and we plan to continue it."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We believe, however, that a reordering of priorities to focus on the most important and cost-effective NASA programs can result in a savings of a quarter of a million dollars."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, coming down from space to the mailbox, the Postal Service has been consistently unable to live within its operating budget."
1981,Reagan,Republican,It is still dependent on large Federal subsidies.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We propose reducing those subsidies by $632 million in 1982 to press the Postal Service into becoming more effective, and in subsequent years the savings will continue to add up."
1981,Reagan,Republican,The Economic Regulatory Administration in the Department of Energy has programs to force companies to convert to specific fuels.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"It has the authority to administer a gas rationing plan, and prior to decontrol it ran the oil price control program."
1981,Reagan,Republican,With these and other regulations gone we can save several hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"I'm sure there's one department you've been waiting for me to mention, the Department of Defense."
1981,Reagan,Republican,It's the only department in our entire program that will actually be increased over the present budgeted figure.
1981,Reagan,Republican,But even here there was no exemption.
1981,Reagan,Republican,The Department of Defense came up with a number of cuts which reduce the budget increase needed to restore our military balance.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"These measures will save $2.9 billion in 1982 outlays, and by 1986 a total of $28.2 billion will have been saved -- or perhaps I should say, will have been made available for the necessary things that we must do."
1981,Reagan,Republican,The aim will be to provide the most effective defense for the lowest possible cost.
1981,Reagan,Republican,I believe that my duty as President requires that I recommend increases in defense spending over the coming years.
1981,Reagan,Republican,I know that you're all aware -- but I think it bears saying again -- that since 1970 the Soviet Union has invested $300 billion more in its military forces than we have.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"As a result of its massive military buildup, the Soviets have made a significant numerical advantage in strategic nuclear delivery systems, tactical aircraft, submarines, artillery, and anti-aircraft defense."
1981,Reagan,Republican,To allow this imbalance to continue is a threat to our national security.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Notwithstanding our economic straits, making the financial changes beginning now is far less costly than waiting and having to attempt a crash program several years from now."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We remain committed to the goal of arms limitation through negotiation.
1981,Reagan,Republican,I hope we can persuade our adversaries to come to realistic balanced and verifiable agreements.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"But, as we negotiate, our security must be fully protected by a balanced and realistic defense program."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, let me say a word here about the general problem of waste and fraud in the Federal Government."
1981,Reagan,Republican,One government estimate indicated that fraud alone may account for anywhere from 1 to 10 percent -- as much as $25 billion of Federal expenditures for social programs.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"If the tax dollars that are wasted or mismanaged are added to this fraud total, the staggering dimensions of this problem begin to emerge."
1981,Reagan,Republican,The Office of Management and Budget is now putting together an interagency task force to attack waste and fraud.
1981,Reagan,Republican,We're also planning to appoint as Inspectors General highly trained professionals who will spare no effort to do this job.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"No administration can promise to immediately stop a trend that has grown in recent years as quickly as government expenditures themselves, but let me say this: Waste and fraud in the Federal Government is exactly what I've called it before -- an unrelenting national scandal, a scandal we're bound and determined to do something about."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Marching in lockstep with the whole program of reductions in spending is the equally important program of reduced tax rates.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Both are essential if we're to have economic recovery.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"It's time to create new jobs, to build and rebuild industry, and to give the American people room to do what they do best."
1981,Reagan,Republican,And that can only be done with a tax program which provides incentive to increase productivity for both workers and industry.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Our proposal is for a 10-percent across-the-board cut every year for 3 years in the tax rates for all individual income taxpayers, making a total cut in the tax-cut rates of 30 percent."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This 3-year reduction will also apply to the tax on unearned income, leading toward an eventual elimination of the present differential between the tax on earned and unearned income."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, I would have hoped that we could be retroactive with this."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"But as it stands, the effective starting date for these 10-percent personal income tax rate reductions will call for as of July 1st of this year."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Again, let me remind you that while this 30-percent reduction will leave the taxpayers with $500 billion more in their pockets over the next 5 years, it's actually only a reduction in the tax increase already built into the system."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Unlike some past ""tax reforms,"" this is not merely a shift of wealth between different sets of taxpayers."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This proposal for an equal reduction in everyone's tax rates will expand our national prosperity, enlarge national incomes, and increase opportunities for all Americans."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Some will argue, I know, that reducing tax rates now will be inflationary."
1981,Reagan,Republican,A solid body of economic experts does not agree.
1981,Reagan,Republican,And tax cuts adopted over the past three-fourths of a century indicate these economic experts are right.
1981,Reagan,Republican,They will not be inflationary.
1981,Reagan,Republican,I've had advice that in 1985 our real production in goods and services will grow by 20 percent and be $300 billion higher than it is today.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The average worker's wage will rise in real purchasing power 8 percent, and this is in after-tax dollars."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And this, of course, is predicated on a complete program of tax cuts and spending reductions being implemented."
1981,Reagan,Republican,The other part of the tax package is aimed directly at providing business and industry with the capital needed to modernize and engage in more research and development.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This will involve an increase in depreciation allowances, and this part of our tax proposal will be retroactive to January 1st."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The present depreciation system is obsolete, needlessly complex, and economically counterproductive."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Very simply, it bases the depreciation of plant machinery and vehicles and tools on their original cost, with no recognition of how inflation has increased their replacement cost."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We're proposing a much shorter write-off time than is presently allowed -- a 5-year-write-off for machinery, 3 years for vehicles and trucks, and a 10-year write-off for plant."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"In fiscal year 1982 under this plan, business would acquire nearly $10 billion for investment; by 1985, the figure would be nearly 45 billion."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"These changes are essential to provide the new investment which is needed to create millions of new jobs between now and 1985 [1986], and to make America competitive once again in the world market."
1981,Reagan,Republican,These won't be make-work jobs.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"They are productive jobs, jobs with a future."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"I'm well aware that there are many other desirable and needed tax changes, such as indexing the income tax brackets to protect taxpayers against inflation; the unjust discrimination against married couples if both are working and earning; tuition tax credits; the unfairness of the inheritance tax, especially to the family-owned farm and the family-owned business; and a number of others."
1981,Reagan,Republican,But our program for economic recovery is so urgently needed to begin to bring down inflation that I'm asking you to act on this plan first and with great urgency.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And then, I pledge I will join with you in seeking these additional tax changes at the earliest date possible."
1981,Reagan,Republican,American society experienced a virtual explosion in government regulation during the past decade.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Between 1970 and 1979, expenditures for the major regulatory agencies quadrupled."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The number of pages published annually in the Federal Register nearly tripled, and the number of pages in the Code of Federal Regulations increased by nearly two-thirds."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The result has been higher prices, higher unemployment, and lower productivity growth."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Overregulation causes small and independent business men and women, as well as large businesses to defer or terminate plans for expansion."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And since they're responsible for most of the new jobs, those new jobs just aren't created."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, we have no intention of dismantling the regulatory agencies, especially those necessary to protect environment and assure the public health and safety."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"However, we must come to grips with inefficient and burdensome regulations, eliminate those we can and reform the others."
1981,Reagan,Republican,I have asked Vice President Bush to head a Cabinet-level Task Force on Regulatory Relief.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Second, I asked each member of my Cabinet to postpone the effective dates of the hundreds of new regulations which have not yet been implemented."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Third, in coordination with the Task Force, many of the agency heads have already taken prompt action to review and rescind existing burdensome regulations."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And finally, just yesterday I signed an Executive order that for the first time provides for effective and coordinated management of the regulatory process."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Much has been accomplished, but it's only a beginning."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We will eliminate those regulations that are unproductive and unnecessary by Executive order where possible and cooperate fully with you on those that require legislation.
1981,Reagan,Republican,The final aspect of our plan requires a national monetary policy which does not allow money growth to increase consistently faster than the growth of goods and services.
1981,Reagan,Republican,In order to curb inflation we need to slow the growth in our money supply.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Now, we fully recognize the independence of the Federal Reserve System and will do nothing to interfere with or undermine that independence."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We will consult regularly with the Federal Reserve Board on all aspects of our economic program and will vigorously pursue budget policies that'll make their job easier in reducing monetary growth.
1981,Reagan,Republican,A successful program to achieve stable and and moderate growth patterns in the money supply will keep both inflation and interest rates down and restore vigor to our financial institutions and markets.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This, then, is our proposal -- America's new beginning: a program for economic recovery."
1981,Reagan,Republican,I don't want it to be simply the plan of my administration.
1981,Reagan,Republican,I'm here tonight to ask you to join me in making it our plan.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Together we can embark on this road -- -- [applause].
1981,Reagan,Republican,Thank you very much.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"I should have arranged to quit right here. [Laughter] Well, together we can embark on this road, not to make things easy, but to make things better."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Our social, political, and cultural, as well as our economic institutions, can no longer absorb the repeated shocks that have been dealt them over the past decades."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Can we do the job?
1981,Reagan,Republican,The answer is yes.
1981,Reagan,Republican,But we must begin now.
1981,Reagan,Republican,We're in control here.
1981,Reagan,Republican,There's nothing wrong with America that together we can't fix.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"I'm sure there'll be some who raise the old familiar cry, ""Don't touch my program; cut somewhere else."" I hope I've made it plain that our approach has been evenhanded, that only the programs for the truly deserving needy remain untouched."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The question is, are we simply going to go down the same path we've gone down before, carving out one special program here, another special program there?"
1981,Reagan,Republican,I don't think that's what the American people expect of us.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"More important, I don't think that's what they want."
1981,Reagan,Republican,They're ready to return to the source of our strength.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The substance and prosperity of our nation is built by wages brought home from the factories and the mills, the farms, and the shops."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"They are the services provided in 10,000 corners of America; the interest on the thrift of our people and the returns for their risk-taking."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"The production of America is the possession of those who build, serve, create, and produce."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"For too long now, we've removed from our people the decisions on how to dispose of what they created."
1981,Reagan,Republican,We've strayed from first principles.
1981,Reagan,Republican,We must alter our course.
1981,Reagan,Republican,The taxing power of government must be used to provide revenues for legitimate government purposes.
1981,Reagan,Republican,It must not be used to regulate the the economy or bring about social change.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We've tried that, and surely we must be able to see it doesn't work."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Spending by government must be limited to those functions which are the proper province of government.
1981,Reagan,Republican,We can no longer afford things simply because we think of them.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Next year we can reduce the budget by $41.4 billion, without harm to government's legitimate purposes or to our responsibility to all who need our benevolence."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"This, plus the reduction in tax rates, will help bring an end to inflation."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"In the health and social services area alone, the plan we're proposing will substantially reduce the need for 465 pages of law, 1,400 pages of regulations, 5,000 Federal employees who presently administer 7,600 separate grants in about 25,000 separate locations."
1981,Reagan,Republican,Over 7 million man and woman hours of work by State and local officials are required to fill out government forms.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"I would direct a question to those who have indicated already an unwillingness to accept such a plan: Have they an alternative which offers a greater chance of balancing the budget, reducing and eliminating inflation, stimulating the creation of jobs, and reducing the tax burden?"
1981,Reagan,Republican,"And, if they haven't, are they suggesting we can continue on the present course without coming to a day of reckoning?"
1981,Reagan,Republican,"If we don't do this, inflation and the growing tax burden will put an end to everything we believe in and our dreams for the future."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We don't have an option of living with inflation and its attendant tragedy, millions of productive people willing and able to work but unable to find a buyer for their work in the job market."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"We have an alternative, and that is the program for economic recovery."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"True, it'll take time for the favorable effects of our proposal to be felt."
1981,Reagan,Republican,"So, we must begin now."
1981,Reagan,Republican,The people are watching and waiting.
1981,Reagan,Republican,They don't demand miracles.
1981,Reagan,Republican,They do expect us to act.
1981,Reagan,Republican,Let us act together.
1981,Reagan,Republican,"Thank you, and good night."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS REPORTING ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 26, 1982 Mr."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Today marks my first State of the Union address to you, a constitutional duty as old as our Republic itself."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"President Washington began this tradition in 1790 after reminding the Nation that the destiny of self-government and the ""preservation of the sacred fire of liberty"" is ""finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people."" For our friends in the press, who place a high premium on accuracy, let me say: I did not actually hear George Washington say that. [Laughter] But it is a matter of historic record. [Laughter] But from this podium, Winston Churchill asked the free world to stand together against the onslaught of aggression."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke of a day of infamy and summoned a nation to arms.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Douglas MacArthur made an unforgettable farewell to a country he loved and served so well.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Dwight Eisenhower reminded us that peace was purchased only at the price of strength.
1982,Reagan,Republican,And John F.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Kennedy spoke of the burden and glory that is freedom.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"When I visited this Chamber last year as a newcomer to Washington, critical of past policies which I believed had failed, I proposed a new spirit of partnership between this Congress and this administration and between Washington and our State and local governments."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In forging this new partnership for America, we could achieve the oldest hopes of our Republic -- prosperity for our nation, peace for the world, and the blessings of individual liberty for our children and, someday, for all of humanity."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"It's my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have made in our relations with other nations, on the foundation we've carefully laid for our economic recovery, and finally, on a bold and spirited initiative that I believe can change the face of American government and make it again the servant of the people."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Seldom have the stakes been higher for America.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"What we do and say here will make all the difference to autoworkers in Detroit, lumberjacks in the Northwest, steelworkers in Steubenville who are in the unemployment lines; to black teenagers in Newark and Chicago; to hard-pressed farmers and small businessmen; and to millions of everyday Americans who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their children."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"To understand the state of the Union, we must look not only at where we are and where we're going but where we've been."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The situation at this time last year was truly ominous.
1982,Reagan,Republican,The last decade has seen a series of recessions.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"There was a recession in 1970, in 1974, and again in the spring of 1980."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Each time, unemployment increased and inflation soon turned up again."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We coined the word ""stagflation"" to describe this."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Government's response to these recessions was to pump up the money supply and increase spending.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In the last 6 months of 1980, as an example, the money supply increased at the fastest rate in postwar history -- 13 percent."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Inflation remained in double digits, and government spending increased at an annual rate of 17 percent."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Interest rates reached a staggering 21\1/2\ percent.
1982,Reagan,Republican,There were 8 million unemployed.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Late in 1981 we sank into the present recession, largely because continued high interest rates hurt the auto industry and construction."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And there was a drop in productivity, and the already high unemployment increased."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"This time, however, things are different."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We have an economic program in place, completely different from the artificial quick fixes of the past."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"It calls for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending, and already that rate has been cut nearly in half."
1982,Reagan,Republican,But reduced spending alone isn't enough.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We've just implemented the first and smallest phase of a 3-year tax-rate reduction designed to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Already interest rates are down to 15\3/4\ percent, but they must still go lower."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Inflation is down from 12.4 percent to 8.9, and for the month of December it was running at an annualized rate of 5.2 percent."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"If we had not acted as we did, things would be far worse for all Americans than they are today."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Inflation, taxes, and interest rates would all be higher."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"A year ago, Americans' faith in their governmental process was steadily declining."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Six out of 10 Americans were saying they were pessimistic about their future.
1982,Reagan,Republican,A new kind of defeatism was heard.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Some said our domestic problems were uncontrollable, that we had to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment."
1982,Reagan,Republican,There were also pessimistic predictions about the relationship between our administration and this Congress.
1982,Reagan,Republican,It was said we could never work together.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Well, those predictions were wrong."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The record is clear, and I believe that history will remember this as an era of American renewal, remember this administration as an administration of change, and remember this Congress as a Congress of destiny."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we not only cut the increase in government spending nearly in half, we brought about the largest tax reductions and the most sweeping changes in our tax structure since the beginning of this century."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And because we indexed future taxes to the rate of inflation, we took away government's built-in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to grow larger at the expense of American workers."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Together, after 50 years of taking power away from the hands of the people in their States and local communities, we have started returning power and resources to them."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we have cut the growth of new Federal regulations nearly in half."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In 1981 there were 23,000 fewer pages in the Federal Register, which lists new regulations, than there were in 1980."
1982,Reagan,Republican,By deregulating oil we've come closer to achieving energy independence and helped bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we have created an effective Federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In just 6 months it has saved the taxpayers more than $2 billion, and it's only getting started."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Together we've begun to mobilize the private sector, not to duplicate wasteful and discredited government programs, but to bring thousands of Americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of America's social problems."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Together we've begun to restore that margin of military safety that ensures peace.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Our country's uniform is being worn once again with pride.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Together we have made a New Beginning, but we have only begun."
1982,Reagan,Republican,No one pretends that the way ahead will be easy.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In my Inaugural Address last year, I warned that the ""ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away . . . because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had it in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom."" The economy will face difficult moments in the months ahead."
1982,Reagan,Republican,But the program for economic recovery that is in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the latter half of this year.
1982,Reagan,Republican,And that is why I can report to you tonight that in the near future the state of the Union and the economy will be better -- much better -- if we summon the strength to continue on the course that we've charted.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And so, the question: If the fundamentals are in place, what now?"
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Well, two things."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"First, we must understand what's happening at the moment to the economy."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our current problems are not the product of the recovery program that's only just now getting underway, as some would have you believe; they are the inheritance of decades of tax and tax and spend and spend."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Second, because our economic problems are deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fixes, we must stick to our carefully integrated plan for recovery."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"That plan is based on four commonsense fundamentals: continued reduction of the growth in Federal spending; preserving the individual and business tax reductions that will stimulate saving and investment; removing unnecessary Federal regulations to spark productivity; and maintaining a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy, the latter a responsibility of the Federal Reserve System."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The only alternative being offered to this economic program is a return to the policies that gave us a trillion-dollar debt, runaway inflation, runaway interest rates and unemployment."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The doubters would have us turn back the clock with tax increases that would offset the personal tax-rate reductions already passed by this Congress.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Raise present taxes to cut future deficits, they tell us."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I don't believe we should buy that argument."
1982,Reagan,Republican,There are too many imponderables for anyone to predict deficits or surpluses several years ahead with any degree of accuracy.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The budget in place, when I took office, had been projected as balanced."
1982,Reagan,Republican,It turned out to have one of the biggest deficits in history.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Another example of the imponderables that can make deficit projections highly questionable -- a change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some $25 billion.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"As it now stands, our forecast, which we're required by law to make, will show major deficits starting at less than a hundred billion dollars and declining, but still too high."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"More important, we're making progress with the three keys to reducing deficits: economic growth, lower interest rates, and spending control."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The policies we have in place will reduce the deficit steadily, surely, and in time, completely."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Higher taxes would not mean lower deficits.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"If they did, how would we explain that tax revenues more than doubled just since 1976; yet in that same 6-year period we ran the largest series of deficits in our history."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In 1980 tax revenues increased by $54 billion, and in 1980 we had one of our alltime biggest deficits."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Raising taxes won't balance the budget; it will encourage more government spending and less private investment.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Raising taxes will slow economic growth, reduce production, and destroy future jobs, making it more difficult for those without jobs to find them and more likely that those who now have jobs could lose them."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"So, I will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the backs of the American taxpayers."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"I will seek no tax increases this year, and I have no intention of retreating from our basic program of tax relief."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"I promise to bring the American people -- to bring their tax rates down and to keep them down, to provide them incentives to rebuild our economy, to save, to invest in America's future."
1982,Reagan,Republican,I will stand by my word.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight I'm urging the American people: Seize these new opportunities to produce, to save, to invest, and together we'll make this economy a mighty engine of freedom, hope, and prosperity again."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Now, the budget deficit this year will exceed our earlier expectations."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The recession did that.
1982,Reagan,Republican,It lowered revenues and increased costs.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"To some extent, we're also victims of our own success."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We've brought inflation down faster than we thought we could, and in doing this, we've deprived government of those hidden revenues that occur when inflation pushes people into higher income tax brackets."
1982,Reagan,Republican,And the continued high interest rates last year cost the government about $5 billion more than anticipated.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more waste, and we will continue our efforts to reduce the number of employees in the Federal work force by 75,000."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The budget plan I submit to you on February 8th will realize major savings by dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education and by eliminating ineffective subsidies for business.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We'll continue to redirect our resources to our two highest budget priorities -- a strong national defense to keep America free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social programs for those who have contributed and those who are in need.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Contrary to some of the wild charges you may have heard, this administration has not and will not turn its back on America's elderly or America's poor."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Under the new budget, funding for social insurance programs will be more than double the amount spent only 6 years ago."
1982,Reagan,Republican,But it would be foolish to pretend that these or any programs cannot be made more efficient and economical.
1982,Reagan,Republican,The entitlement programs that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goals and many deserving recipients.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We will protect them.
1982,Reagan,Republican,But there's only one way to see to it that these programs really help those whom they were designed to help.
1982,Reagan,Republican,And that is to bring their spiraling costs under control.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Today we face the absurd situation of a Federal budget with three-quarters of its expenditures routinely referred to as ""uncontrollable."" And a large part of this goes to entitlement programs."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Committee after committee of this Congress has heard witness after witness describe many of these programs as poorly administered and rife with waste and fraud.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Virtually every American who shops in a local supermarket is aware of the daily abuses that take place in the food stamp program, which has grown by 16,000 percent in the last 15 years."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Another example is Medicare and Medicaid -- programs with worthy goals but whose costs have increased from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion, more than 5 times as much, in just 10 years."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Waste and fraud are serious problems.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Back in 1980 Federal investigators testified before one of your committees that ""corruption has permeated virtually every area of the Medicare and Medicaid health care industry."" One official said many of the people who are cheating the system were ""very confident that nothing was going to happen to them."" Well, something is going to happen."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Not only the taxpayers are defrauded; the people with real dependency on these programs are deprived of what they need, because available resources are going not to the needy, but to the greedy."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The time has come to control the uncontrollable.
1982,Reagan,Republican,In August we made a start.
1982,Reagan,Republican,I signed a bill to reduce the growth of these programs by $44 billion over the next 3 years while at the same time preserving essential services for the truly needy.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Shortly you will receive from me a message on further reforms we intend to install -- some new, but others long recommended by your own congressional committees."
1982,Reagan,Republican,I ask you to help make these savings for the American taxpayer.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The savings we propose in entitlement programs will total some $63 billion over 4 years and will, without affecting social security, go a long way toward bringing Federal spending under control."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"But don't be fooled by those who proclaim that spending cuts will deprive the elderly, the needy, and the helpless."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The Federal Government will still subsidize 95 million meals every day.
1982,Reagan,Republican,That's one out of seven of all the meals served in America.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Head Start, senior nutrition programs, and child welfare programs will not be cut from the levels we proposed last year."
1982,Reagan,Republican,More than one-half billion dollars has been proposed for minority business assistance.
1982,Reagan,Republican,And research at the National Institute of Health will be increased by over $100 million.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"While meeting all these needs, we intend to plug unwarranted tax loopholes and strengthen the law which requires all large corporations to pay a minimum tax."
1982,Reagan,Republican,I am confident the economic program we've put into operation will protect the needy while it triggers a recovery that will benefit all Americans.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"It will stimulate the economy, result in increased savings and provide capital for expansion, mortgages for homebuilding, and jobs for the unemployed."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Now that the essentials of that program are in place, our next major undertaking must be a program -- just as bold, just as innovative -- to make government again accountable to the people, to make our system of federalism work again."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our citizens feel they've lost control of even the most basic decisions made about the essential services of government, such as schools, welfare, roads, and even garbage collection."
1982,Reagan,Republican,And they're right.
1982,Reagan,Republican,A maze of interlocking jurisdictions and levels of government confronts average citizens in trying to solve even the simplest of problems.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"They don't know where to turn for answers, who to hold accountable, who to praise, who to blame, who to vote for or against."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The main reason for this is the overpowering growth of Federal grants-in-aid programs during the past few decades.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In 1960 the Federal Government had 132 categorical grant programs, costing $7 billion."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"When I took office, there were approximately 500, costing nearly a hundred billion dollars -- 13 programs for energy, 36 for pollution control, 66 for social services, 90 for education."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And here in the Congress, it takes at least 166 committees just to try to keep track of them."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"You know and I know that neither the President nor the Congress can properly oversee this jungle of grants-in-aid; indeed, the growth of these grants has led to the distortion in the vital functions of government."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"As one Democratic Governor put it recently: The National Government should be worrying about ""arms control, not potholes."" The growth in these Federal programs has -- in the words of one intergovernmental commission -- made the Federal Government ""more pervasive, more intrusive, more unmanageable, more ineffective and costly, and above all, more [un]accountable."" Let's solve this problem with a single, bold stroke: the return of some $47 billion in Federal programs to State and local government, together with the means to finance them and a transition period of nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption."
1982,Reagan,Republican,I will shortly send this Congress a message describing this program.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"I want to emphasize, however, that its full details will have been worked out only after close consultation with congressional, State, and local officials."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Starting in fiscal 1984, the Federal Government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly growing Medicaid program to go along with its existing responsibility for Medicare."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"As part of a financially equal swap, the States will simultaneously take full responsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"This will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need, because it'll be designed and administered closer to the grassroots and the people it serves."
1982,Reagan,Republican,In 1984 the Federal Government will apply the full proceeds from certain excise taxes to a grassroots trust fund that will belong in fair shares to the 50 States.
1982,Reagan,Republican,The total amount flowing into this fund will be $28 billion a year.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Over the next 4 years the States can use this money in either of two ways.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"If they want to continue receiving Federal grants in such areas as transportation, education, and social services, they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grants."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Or to the extent they choose to forgo the Federal grant programs, they can use their trust fund money on their own for those or other purposes."
1982,Reagan,Republican,There will be a mandatory pass-through of part of these funds to local governments.
1982,Reagan,Republican,By 1988 the States will be in complete control of over 40 Federal grant programs.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The trust fund will start to phase out, eventually to disappear, and the excise taxes will be turned over to the States."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"They can then preserve, lower, or raise taxes on their own and fund and manage these programs as they see fit."
1982,Reagan,Republican,In a single stroke we will be accomplishing a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiraling costs at the Federal level while we ensure these programs will be more responsive to both the people they're meant to help and the people who pay for them.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of State and local governments, we're proposing legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban areas in the 1980's and '90's."
1982,Reagan,Republican,This legislation will permit States and localities to apply to the Federal Government for designation as urban enterprise zones.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"A broad range of special economic incentives in the zones will help attract new business, new jobs, new opportunity to America's inner cities and rural towns."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Some will say our mission is to save free enterprise.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I say we must free enterprise so that together we can save America."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Some will also say our States and local communities are not up to the challenge of a new and creative partnership.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Well, that might have been true 20 years ago before reforms like reapportionment and the Voting Rights Act, the 10-year extension of which I strongly support."
1982,Reagan,Republican,It's no longer true today.
1982,Reagan,Republican,This administration has faith in State and local governments and the constitutional balance envisioned by the Founding Fathers.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We also believe in the integrity, decency, and sound, good sense of grassroots Americans."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Our faith in the American people is reflected in another major endeavor.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our private sector initiatives task force is seeking out successful community models of school, church, business, union, foundation, and civic programs that help community needs."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Such groups are almost invariably far more efficient than government in running social programs.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We're not asking them to replace discarded and often discredited government programs dollar for dollar, service for service."
1982,Reagan,Republican,We just want to help them perform the good works they choose and help others to profit by their example.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Three hundred and eighty-five thousand corporations and private organizations are already working on social programs ranging from drug rehabilitation to job training, and thousands more Americans have written us asking how they can help."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The volunteer spirit is still alive and well in America.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our nation's long journey towards civil rights for all our citizens -- once a source of discord, now a source of pride -- must continue with no backsliding or slowing down."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We must and shall see that those basic laws that guarantee equal rights are preserved and, when necessary, strengthened."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Our concern for equal rights for women is firm and unshakable.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We launched a new Task Force on Legal Equity for Women and a Fifty States Project that will examine State laws for discriminatory language.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And for the first time in our history, a woman sits on the highest court in the land."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"So, too, the problem of crime -- one as real and deadly serious as any in America today."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"It demands that we seek transformation of our legal system, which overly protects the rights of criminals while it leaves society and the innocent victims of crime without justice."
1982,Reagan,Republican,We look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase jobs while continuing to improve the quality of our air.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We're encouraged by the bipartisan initiative of the House and are hopeful of further progress as the Senate continues its deliberations.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"So far, I've concentrated largely, now, on domestic matters."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"To view the state of the Union in perspective, we must not ignore the rest of the world."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"There isn't time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social -- or foreign policy, I should say, a subject I intend to address in detail in the near future."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"A few words, however, are in order on the progress we've made over the past year, reestablishing respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenges and goals that we will approach in the year ahead."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"At Ottawa and Cancun, I met with leaders of the major industrial powers and developing nations."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Now, some of those I met with were a little surprised that I didn't apologize for America's wealth."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Instead, I spoke of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help them realize their aspirations for economic development and political freedom."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"I believe lasting friendships were made, and the foundation was laid for future cooperation."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In the vital region of the Caribbean Basin, we're developing a program of aid, trade, and investment incentives to promote self-sustaining growth and a better, more secure life for our neighbors to the south."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Toward those who would export terrorism and subversion in the Caribbean and elsewhere, especially Cuba and Libya, we will act with firmness."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our foreign policy is a policy of strength, fairness, and balance."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"By restoring America's military credibility, by pursuing peace at the negotiating table wherever both sides are willing to sit down in good faith, and by regaining the respect of America's allies and adversaries alike, we have strengthened our country's position as a force for peace and progress in the world."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"When action is called for, we're taking it."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our sanctions against the military dictatorship that has attempted to crush human rights in Poland -- and against the Soviet regime behind that military dictatorship -- clearly demonstrated to the world that America will not conduct ""business as usual"" with the forces of oppression."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"If the events in Poland continue to deteriorate, further measures will follow."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Now, let me also note that private American groups have taken the lead in making January 30th a day of solidarity with the people of Poland."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"So, too, the European Parliament has called for March 21st to be an international day of support for Afghanistan."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I urge all peace-loving peoples to join together on those days, to raise their voices, to speak and pray for freedom."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Meanwhile, we're working for reduction of arms and military activities, as I announced in my address to the Nation last November 18th."
1982,Reagan,Republican,We have proposed to the Soviet Union a far-reaching agenda for mutual reduction of military forces and have already initiated negotiations with them in Geneva on intermediate-range nuclear forces.
1982,Reagan,Republican,In those talks it is essential that we negotiate from a position of strength.
1982,Reagan,Republican,There must be a real incentive for the Soviets to take these talks seriously.
1982,Reagan,Republican,This requires that we rebuild our defenses.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In the last decade, while we sought the moderation of Soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation, the Soviets engaged in an unrelenting buildup of their military forces."
1982,Reagan,Republican,The protection of our national security has required that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military forces.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"We have not neglected to strengthen our traditional alliances in Europe and Asia, or to develop key relationships with our partners in the Middle East and other countries."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Building a more peaceful world requires a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"When radical forces threaten our friends, when economic misfortune creates conditions of instability, when strategically vital parts of the world fall under the shadow of Soviet power, our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence."
1982,Reagan,Republican,That's why we've laid such stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Your recent passage of the Foreign Assistance Act sent a signal to the world that America will not shrink from making the investments necessary for both peace and security.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Our foreign policy must be rooted in realism, not naivete or self-delusion."
1982,Reagan,Republican,A recognition of what the Soviet empire is about is the starting point.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Winston Churchill, in negotiating with the Soviets, observed that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealings with other nations."
1982,Reagan,Republican,That's why we've moved to reconstruct our national defenses.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We intend to keep the peace.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We will also keep our freedom.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We have made pledges of a new frankness in our public statements and worldwide broadcasts.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"In the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation, we've promised the world a season of truth -- the truth of our great civilized ideas: individual liberty, representative government, the rule of law under God."
1982,Reagan,Republican,We've never needed walls or minefields or barbed wire to keep our people in.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from voting for the kind of government they want.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, we have our problems; yes, we're in a time of recession."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And it's true, there's no quick fix, as I said, to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment."
1982,Reagan,Republican,But we will end it.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"The process has already begun, and we'll see its effect as the year goes on."
1982,Reagan,Republican,We speak with pride and admiration of that little band of Americans who overcame insuperable odds to set this nation on course 200 years ago.
1982,Reagan,Republican,But our glory didn't end with them.
1982,Reagan,Republican,Americans ever since have emulated their deeds.
1982,Reagan,Republican,We don't have to turn to our history books for heroes.
1982,Reagan,Republican,They're all around us.
1982,Reagan,Republican,One who sits among you here tonight epitomized that heroism at the end of the longest imprisonment ever inflicted on men of our Armed Forces.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Who will ever forget that night when we waited for television to bring us the scene of that first plane landing at Clark Field in the Philippines, bringing our POW's home?"
1982,Reagan,Republican,The plane door opened and Jeremiah Denton came slowly down the ramp.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"He caught sight of our flag, saluted it, said, ""God bless America,"" and then thanked us for bringing him home."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Just 2 weeks ago, in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the Potomac, we saw again the spirit of American heroism at its finest -- the heroism of dedicated rescue workers saving crash victims from icy waters."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And we saw the heroism of one of our young government employees, Lenny Skutnik, who, when he saw a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line, dived into the water and dragged her to safety."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"And then there are countless, quiet, everyday heroes of American life -- parents who sacrifice long and hard so their children will know a better life than they've known; church and civic volunteers who help to feed, clothe, nurse, and teach the needy; millions who've made our nation and our nation's destiny so very special -- unsung heroes who may not have realized their own dreams themselves but then who reinvest those dreams in their children."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Don't let anyone tell you that America's best days are behind her, that the American spirit has been vanquished."
1982,Reagan,Republican,We've seen it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing in it now.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"A hundred and twenty years ago, the greatest of all our Presidents delivered his second State of the Union message in this Chamber. ""We cannot escape history,"" Abraham Lincoln warned. ""We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves."" The ""trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest [last] generation."" Well, that President and that Congress did not fail the American people."
1982,Reagan,Republican,Together they weathered the storm and preserved the Union.
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Let it be said of us that we, too, did not fail; that we, too, worked together to bring America through difficult times."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"Let us so conduct ourselves that two centuries from now, another Congress and another President, meeting in this Chamber as we are meeting, will speak of us with pride, saying that we met the test and preserved for them in their day the sacred flame of liberty -- this last, best hope of man on Earth."
1982,Reagan,Republican,"God bless you, and thank you."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 25, 1983 Mr."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: This solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a President of the United States has reported on the State of the Union since George Washington first did so in 1790."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"That's a lot of reports, but there's no shortage of new things to say about the State of the Union."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The very key to our success has been our ability, foremost among nations, to preserve our lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do together -- not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans -- to make tomorrow's America happy and prosperous at home, strong and respected abroad, and at peace in the world."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"As we gather here tonight, the state of our Union is strong, but our economy is troubled."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"For too many of our fellow citizens -- farmers, steel and auto workers, lumbermen, black teenagers, working mothers -- this is a painful period."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"It has fallen to us, in our time, to undo damage that was a long time in the making, and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a better future for ourselves and our children."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We have a long way to go, but thanks to the courage, patience, and strength of our people, America is on the mend."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But let me give you just one important reason why I believe this -- it involves many members of this body.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Just 10 days ago, after months of debate and deadlock, the bipartisan Commission on Social Security accomplished the seemingly impossible."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Social security, as some of us had warned for so long, faced disaster."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I, myself, have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"As 1983 began, the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy, a double victim of our economic ills."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"First, a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Then the recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wage base and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million Americans who depend on it.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"When the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and I performed the bipartisan -- or formed the bipartisan Commission on Social Security, pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting interests would prevent the Commission from agreeing on a plan to save social security."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Well, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are wrong."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the Commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair, workable plan."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"They proved that, when it comes to the national welfare, Americans can still pull together for the common good."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, I'm especially pleased to join with the Speaker and the Senate majority leader in urging the Congress to enact this plan by Easter."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"There are elements in it, of course, that none of us prefers, but taken together it performs a package that all of us can support."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"It asks for some sacrifice by all -- the self-employed, beneficiaries, workers, government employees, and the better-off among the retired -- but it imposes an undue burden on none."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And, in supporting it, we keep an important pledge to the American people: The integrity of the social security system will be preserved, and no one's payments will be reduced."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The Commission's plan will do the job; indeed, it must do the job."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We owe it to today's older Americans and today's younger workers.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"So, before we go any further, I ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the Commission who are here tonight and Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker and Speaker Tip O'Neill for a job well done."
1983,Reagan,Republican,I hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face the challenges of the year ahead.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Nearly half a century ago, in this Chamber, another American President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his second State of the Union message, urged America to look to the future, to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that looks forward, not backward. ""Throughout the world,"" he said, ""change is the order of the day."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In every nation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to [of] many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared."" He also reminded us that ""the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in Government than in politics."" So, let us, in these next 2 years -- men and women of both parties, every political shade -- concentrate on the long-range, bipartisan responsibilities of government, not the short-range or short-term temptations of partisan politics."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected; the recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Unemployment is far too high.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Projected Federal spending -- if government refuses to tighten its own belt -- will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway.
1983,Reagan,Republican,This recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer items and capital goods -- the stimulus we need to restart our stalled economic engines.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The American people have already stepped up their rate of saving, assuring that the funds needed to modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The inflationary expectations that led to a 21\1/2\-percent interest prime rate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by almost half.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Leaders have started to realize that double-digit inflation is no longer a way of life.I misspoke there.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I should have said ""lenders."" So, interest rates have tumbled, paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The early evidence of that recovery has started coming in.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Housing starts for the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago, and housing permits, a sure indicator of future growth, were up a whopping 60 percent."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We're witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that American industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and abroad, ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the Nation's work force."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we've now paid such a heavy price to cure.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The permanent recovery in employment, production, and investment we seek won't come in a sharp, short spurt."
1983,Reagan,Republican,It'll build carefully and steadily in the months and years ahead.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the meantime, the challenge of government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the American people."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The Federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending, we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next 4 years alone.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"That would average $4,300 in additional debt for every man, woman, child, and baby in our nation."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"To assure a sustained recovery, we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"If we don't, the recovery will be too short, unemployment will remain too high, and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children."
1983,Reagan,Republican,That we must not do.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Let's be clear about where the deficit problem comes from.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Contrary to the drumbeat we've been hearing for the last few months, the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Taken as a percentage of the gross national product, our defense spending happens to be only about four-fifths of what it was in 1970."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Nor is the deficit, as some would have it, rooted in tax cuts."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Even with our tax cuts, taxes as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they were in 1970."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The fact is, our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"During the 1970's, the share of our national income devoted to this domestic spending increased by more than 60 percent, from 10 cents out of every dollar produced by the American people to 16 cents."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In spite of all our economies and efficiencies, and without adding any new programs, basic, necessary domestic spending provided for in this year's budget will grow to almost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our Republic.
1983,Reagan,Republican,We need a plan to overcome this danger -- a plan based on these principles.
1983,Reagan,Republican,It must be bipartisan.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Conquering the deficits and putting the Government's house in order will require the best effort of all of us.
1983,Reagan,Republican,It must be fair.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery, all would share fairly in the burden of transition."
1983,Reagan,Republican,It must be prudent.
1983,Reagan,Republican,The strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And finally, it must be realistic."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We can't rely on hope alone.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"With these guiding principles in mind, let me outline a four-part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"First, in my budget message, I will recommend a Federal spending freeze."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I know this is strong medicine, but so far, we have only cut the rate of increase in Federal spending."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The Government has continued to spend more money each year, though not as much more as it did in the past."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Taken as a whole, the budget I'm proposing for the fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In other words, the Federal Government will hold the line on real spending."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Now, that's far less than many American families have had to do in these difficult times."
1983,Reagan,Republican,I will request that the proposed 6-month freeze in cost-of-living adjustments recommended by the bipartisan Social Security Commission be applied to other government-related retirement programs.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I will, also, propose a 1-year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs, and for Federal civilian and military pay and pension programs."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And let me say right here, I'm sorry, with regard to the military, in asking that of them, because for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But I'm sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Second, I will ask the Congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so-called uncontrollable spending programs."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"These are the automatic spending programs, such as food stamps, that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970."
1983,Reagan,Republican,They are the largest single cause of the built-in or structural deficit problem.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Our standard here will be fairness, ensuring that the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars go only to the truly needy; that none of them are turned away, but that fraud and waste are stamped out."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And I'm sorry to say, there's a lot of it out there."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the food stamp program alone, last year, we identified almost [$]1.1 billion in overpayments."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The taxpayers aren't the only victims of this kind of abuse.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The truly needy suffer as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy, but by the greedy."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"For everyone's sake, we must put an end to such waste and corruption."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Third, I will adjust our program to restore America's defenses by proposing $55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"These are savings recommended to me by the Secretary of Defense, who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger America's security."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We will not gamble with our national survival.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And fourth, because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over the next several years, I will propose a standby tax, limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product, to start in fiscal 1986."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"It would last no more than 3 years, and it would start only if the Congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And there are several other conditions also that must be met, all of them in order for this program to be triggered."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Now, you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future, a remedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely necessary."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the meantime, we'll continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all Americans."
1983,Reagan,Republican,This is a goal that every American who's ever struggled with a tax form can understand.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"At the same time, however, I will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax reforms that we've already enacted, including the 10-percent tax break coming to taxpayers this July and the tax indexing which will protect all Americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Now, I realize that this four-part plan is easier to describe than it will be to enact."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But the looming deficits that hang over us and over America's future must be reduced.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The path I've outlined is fair, balanced, and realistic."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"If enacted, it will ensure a steady decline in deficits, aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"It's the only path that will lead to a strong, sustained recovery."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Let us follow that path together.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"No domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable, permanent jobs for all Americans who want to work."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The recovery program will provide jobs for most, but others will need special help and training for new skills."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Shortly, I will submit to the Congress the Employment Act of 1983, designed to get at the special problems of the long-term unemployed, as well as young people trying to enter the job market."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I'll propose extending unemployment benefits, including special incentives to employers who hire the long-term unemployed, providing programs for displaced workers, and helping federally funded and State-administered unemployment insurance programs provide workers with training and relocation assistance."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Finally, our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We must offer both short-term help and long-term hope for our unemployed.
1983,Reagan,Republican,I hope we can work together on this.
1983,Reagan,Republican,I hope we can work together as we did last year in enacting the landmark Job Training Partnership Act.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Regulatory reform legislation, a responsible clean air act, and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity."
1983,Reagan,Republican,One of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"So, I will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade -- one that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to America's farmers and workers in the world marketplace."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We must have adequate export financing to sell American products overseas.
1983,Reagan,Republican,I will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We must strengthen the organization of our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow of American goods, services, and investments."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Our trade position can also be improved by making our port system more efficient.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Better, more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coalfields, railroads, trucking industry, and ports."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"After 2 years of debate, it's time for us to get together and enact a port modernization bill."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Education, training, and retraining are fundamental to our success as are research and development and productivity."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Labor, management, and government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools of growth."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Tax policy, regulatory practices, and government programs all need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Every American has a role and a stake in international trade.
1983,Reagan,Republican,We Americans are still the technological leaders in most fields.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We must keep that edge, and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics -- starting with our educational system."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"While we grew complacent, others have acted."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Japan, with a population only about half the size of ours, graduates from its universities more engineers than we do."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"If a child doesn't receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of 16, he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We must join together -- parents, teachers, grassroots groups, organized labor, and the business community -- to revitalize American education by setting a standard of excellence."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In 1983 we seek four major education goals: a quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the States; establishment of education savings accounts that will give middle- and lower-income families an incentive to save for their children's college education and, at the same time, encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth; passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools; a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer."
1983,Reagan,Republican,God should never have been expelled from America's classrooms in the first place.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic equity for women, and eliminate, once and for all, all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the United States Code."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We will not tolerate wage discrimination based on sex, and we intend to strengthen enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents, most of whom are women, do not suffer unfair financial hardship."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We will also take action to remedy inequities in pensions.
1983,Reagan,Republican,These initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Also in the area of fairness and equity, we will ask for extension of the Civil Rights Commission, which is due to expire this year."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The Commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in America, and we strongly support its reauthorization."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Effective enforcement of our nation's fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the year ahead, we'll work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all Americans."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking.
1983,Reagan,Republican,It's high time that we make our cities safe again.
1983,Reagan,Republican,This administration hereby declares an all-out war on big-time organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We will also implement recommendations of our Task Force on Victims of Crime, which will report to me this week."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"American agriculture, the envy of the world, has become the victim of its own successes."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"With one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself and 77 other people, America is confronted with record surplus crops and commodity prices below the cost of production."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We must strive, through innovations like the payment-in-kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy, to restore health and vitality to rural America."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Meanwhile, I have instructed the Department of Agriculture to work individually with farmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Over the past year, our Task Force on Private Sector Initiatives has successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business, labor, education, and government to address the training needs of American workers."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Thanks to the Task Force, private sector initiatives are now underway in all 50 States of the Union, and thousands of working people have been helped in making the shift from dead-end jobs and low-demand skills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Additionally, a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community child care."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the coming year, we will also act to improve the quality of life for Americans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many."
1983,Reagan,Republican,And we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older Americans.
1983,Reagan,Republican,I will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to States and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"During the next several weeks, I will send to the Congress a series of detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working with you on the development of these initiatives."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"So far, now, I've concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"But in almost every home and workplace in America, we're already witnessing reason for great hope -- the first flowering of the man-made miracles of high technology, a field pioneered and still led by our country."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"To many of us now, computers, silicon chips, data processing, cybernetics, and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when that first Model T rattled down Main Street, U.S.A."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"But as surely as America's pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century, the same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front of opportunity, the frontier of high technology."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries, but we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow."
1983,Reagan,Republican,This administration is committed to keeping America the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century.
1983,Reagan,Republican,But let us turn briefly to the international arena.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"America's leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society: free elections, a free press, freedom of religious choice, free trade unions, and above all, freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state."
1983,Reagan,Republican,These values are the bedrock of our strength.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"They unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in NATO, in Asia, in Latin America, and elsewhere."
1983,Reagan,Republican,They are also the values which in the recent past some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Fortunately, we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common democratic values, and we're applying them as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In London last year, I announced the commitment of the United States to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The future belongs not to governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples, but to democratic systems of self-government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strength -- economic strength and military strength.
1983,Reagan,Republican,A strong American economy is essential to the well-being and security of our friends and allies.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The restoration of a strong, healthy American economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The progress I've been able to report to you tonight will, I know, be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the American people."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We must also recognize that our own economic well-being is inextricably linked to the world economy.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We export over 20 percent of our industrial production, and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We will continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of Europe and Japan and with the International Monetary Fund to ensure it has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong, noninflationary growth."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"As the leader of the West and as a country that has become great and rich because of economic freedom, America must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"As some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism, our strategy cannot be to follow them, but to lead the way toward freer trade."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"To this end, in May of this year America will host an economic summit meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"As we begin our third year, we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of the past decade."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Our Armed Forces are finally properly paid; after years of neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied.
1983,Reagan,Republican,And the American uniform is once again worn with pride.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Most of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway, and we will be addressing one key system, the MX missile, in consultation with the Congress in a few months."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"America's foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship, on realism, strength, full partnership, in consultation with our allies, and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"From the Middle East to southern Africa to Geneva, American diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We should be proud of our role as peacemakers.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the Middle East last year, the United States played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in Lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Last September, I outlined principles to carry on the peace process begun so promisingly at Camp David."
1983,Reagan,Republican,All the people of the Middle East should know that in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to build on that foundation to bring them the blessings of peace.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In Central America and the Caribbean Basin, we are likewise engaged in a partnership for peace, prosperity, and democracy."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Final passage of the remaining portions of our Caribbean Basin Initiative, which passed the House last year, is one of this administration's top legislative priorities for 1983."
1983,Reagan,Republican,The security and economic assistance policies of this administration in Latin America and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"This undertaking is a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches, and I'm counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the Congress to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal."
1983,Reagan,Republican,At the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the Soviet Union.
1983,Reagan,Republican,The past year saw a change in Soviet leadership.
1983,Reagan,Republican,We're prepared for a positive change in Soviet-American relations.
1983,Reagan,Republican,But the Soviet Union must show by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rights and sovereignty of the family of nations.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Responsible members of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbors.
1983,Reagan,Republican,And they restrain their allies from aggression.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"For our part, we're vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the Soviet Union."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Supported by our allies, we've put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We insist on an equal balance of forces.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And given the overwhelming evidence of Soviet violations of international treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons, we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"In the case of intermediate-range nuclear forces, we have proposed the complete elimination of the entire class of land-based missiles."
1983,Reagan,Republican,We're also prepared to carefully explore serious Soviet proposals.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"At the same time, let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"With firmness and dedication, we'll continue to negotiate."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Deep down, the Soviets must know it's in their interest as well as ours to prevent a wasteful arms race."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence, they will have every reason to join us in the search for greater security and major arms reductions."
1983,Reagan,Republican,When that moment comes -- and I'm confident that it will -- we will have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world's people.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"A very wise man, Bernard Baruch, once said that America has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Our country is a special place, because we Americans have always been sustained, through good times and bad, by a noble vision -- a vision not only of what the world around us is today but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We're realists; we solve our problems instead of ignoring them, no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"But we're also idealists, for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Right now we need both realism and idealism.
1983,Reagan,Republican,Millions of our neighbors are without work.
1983,Reagan,Republican,It is up to us to see they aren't without hope.
1983,Reagan,Republican,This is a task for all of us.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And may I say, Americans have rallied to this cause, proving once again that we are the most generous people on Earth."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy. [Applause] And here all that time, I thought you were reading the paper. [Laughter] The single thing -- the single thing that can start the wheels of industry turning again is further reduction of interest rates."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Just another 1 or 2 points can mean tens of thousands of jobs.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Right now, with inflation as low as it is, 3.9 percent, there is room for interest rates to come down."
1983,Reagan,Republican,Only fear prevents their reduction.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"A lender, as we know, must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollars loaned."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And that depreciation is, of course, the amount of inflation."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Today, interest rates are based on fear -- fear that government will resort to measures, as it has in the past, that will send inflation zooming again."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"We who serve here in this Capital must erase that fear by making it absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation; that, together, we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, the problems confronting us are large and forbidding."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And, certainly, no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Back over the years, citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened; sometimes when its very existence was at stake."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Always with courage and common sense, they met the crises of their time and lived to see a stronger, better, and more prosperous country."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The present situation is no worse and, in fact, is not as bad as some of those they faced."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Time and again, they proved that there is nothing we Americans cannot achieve as free men and women."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, we still have problems -- plenty of them."
1983,Reagan,Republican,But it's just plain wrong -- unjust to our country and unjust to our people -- to let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all: America is on the mend.
1983,Reagan,Republican,We owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can.
1983,Reagan,Republican,No one can quarrel with that.
1983,Reagan,Republican,We must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis.
1983,Reagan,Republican,"But the big story about America today is the way that millions of confident, caring people -- those extraordinary ""ordinary"" Americans who never make the headlines and will never be interviewed -- are laying the foundation, not just for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow for all our people."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"From coast to coast, on the job and in classrooms and laboratories, at new construction sites and in churches and community groups, neighbors are helping neighbors."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"And they've already begun the building, the research, the work, and the giving that will make our country great again."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"I believe this, because I believe in them -- in the strength of their hearts and minds, in the commitment that each one of them brings to their daily lives, be they high or humble."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"The challenge for us in government is to be worthy of them -- to make government a help, not a hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising days ahead."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"If we do that, if we care what our children and our children's children will say of us, if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did here in these temples of freedom, we will work together to make America better for our having been here -- not just in this year or this decade but in the next century and beyond."
1983,Reagan,Republican,"Thank you, and God bless you."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 25, 1984 Mr."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Once again, in keeping with time-honored tradition, I have come to report to you on the state of the Union, and I'm pleased to report that America is much improved, and there's good reason to believe that improvement will continue through the days to come."
1984,Reagan,Republican,You and I have had some honest and open differences in the year past.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But they didn't keep us from joining hands in bipartisan cooperation to stop a long decline that had drained this nation's spirit and eroded its health.
1984,Reagan,Republican,There is renewed energy and optimism throughout the land.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"America is back, standing tall, looking to the eighties with courage, confidence, and hope."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The problems we're overcoming are not the heritage of one person, party, or even one generation."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"It's just the tendency of government to grow, for practices and programs to become the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this Earth. [Laughter] And there's always that well-intentioned chorus of voices saying, ""With a little more power and a little more money, we could do so much for the people."" For a time we forgot the American dream isn't one of making government bigger; it's keeping faith with the mighty spirit of free people under God."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"As we came to the decade of the eighties, we faced the worst crisis in our postwar history."
1984,Reagan,Republican,In the seventies were years of rising problems and falling confidence.
1984,Reagan,Republican,There was a feeling government had grown beyond the consent of the governed.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Families felt helpless in the face of mounting inflation and the indignity of taxes that reduced reward for hard work, thrift, and risk-taking."
1984,Reagan,Republican,All this was overlaid by an ever-growing web of rules and regulations.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"On the international scene, we had an uncomfortable feeling that we'd lost the respect of friend and foe."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Some questioned whether we had the will to defend peace and freedom.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But America is too great for small dreams.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"There was a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival; if you will, a crusade for renewal."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The American people said: Let us look to the future with confidence, both at home and abroad."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Let us give freedom a chance.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Americans were ready to make a new beginning, and together we have done it."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We're confronting our problems one by one.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Hope is alive tonight for millions of young families and senior citizens set free from unfair tax increases and crushing inflation.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Inflation has been beaten down from 12.4 to 3.2 percent, and that's a great victory for all the people."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The prime rate has been cut almost in half, and we must work together to bring it down even more."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we passed the first across-the-board tax reduction for everyone since the Kennedy tax cuts."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Next year, tax rates will be indexed so inflation can't push people into higher brackets when they get cost-of-living pay raises."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Government must never again use inflation to profit at the people's expense.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Today a working family earning $25,000 has $1,100 more in purchasing power than if tax and inflation rates were still at the 1980 levels."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Real after-tax income increased 5 percent last year.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And economic deregulation of key industries like transportation has offered more chances -- or choices, I should say, to consumers and new changes -- or chances for entrepreneurs and protecting safety."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, we can report and be proud of one of the best recoveries in decades."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Send away the handwringers and the doubting Thomases.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Hope is reborn for couples dreaming of owning homes and for risktakers with vision to create tomorrow's opportunities.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The spirit of enterprise is sparked by the sunrise industries of high-tech and by small businesspeople with big ideas -- people like Barbara Proctor, who rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion-dollar advertising agency in Chicago; Carlos Perez, a Cuban refugee, who turned $27 and a dream into a successful importing business in Coral Gables, Florida."
1984,Reagan,Republican,People like these are heroes for the eighties.
1984,Reagan,Republican,They helped 4 million Americans find jobs in 1983.
1984,Reagan,Republican,More people are drawing paychecks tonight than ever before.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And Congress helps -- or progress helps everyone -- well, Congress does too -- [laughter] -- everyone."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"In 1983 women filled 73 percent of all the new jobs in managerial, professional, and technical fields."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"But we know that many of our fellow countrymen are still out of work, wondering what will come of their hopes and dreams."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Can we love America and not reach out to tell them: You are not forgotten; we will not rest until each of you can reach as high as your God-given talents will take you.
1984,Reagan,Republican,The heart of America is strong; it's good and true.
1984,Reagan,Republican,The cynics were wrong; America never was a sick society.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We're seeing rededication to bedrock values of faith, family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom -- values that help bring us together as one people, from the youngest child to the most senior citizen."
1984,Reagan,Republican,The Congress deserves America's thanks for helping us restore pride and credibility to our military.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And I hope that you're as proud as I am of the young men and women in uniform who have volunteered to man the ramparts in defense of freedom and whose dedication, valor, and skill increases so much our chance of living in a world at peace."
1984,Reagan,Republican,People everywhere hunger for peace and a better life.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The tide of the future is a freedom tide, and our struggle for democracy cannot and will not be denied."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"This nation champions peace that enshrines liberty, democratic rights, and dignity for every individual."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"America's new strength, confidence, and purpose are carrying hope and opportunity far from our shores."
1984,Reagan,Republican,A world economic recovery is underway.
1984,Reagan,Republican,It began here.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We've journeyed far, but we have much farther to go."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Franklin Roosevelt told us 50 years ago this month: ""Civilization can not go back; civilization must not stand still."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We have undertaken new methods.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"It is our task to perfect, to improve, to alter when necessary, but in all cases to go forward."" It's time to move forward again, time for America to take freedom's next step."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Let us unite tonight behind four great goals to keep America free, secure, and at peace in the eighties together."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can ensure steady economic growth.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can develop America's next frontier.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can strengthen our traditional values.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And we can build a meaningful peace to protect our loved ones and this shining star of faith that has guided millions from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom, progress, and hope."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Doing these things will open wider the gates of opportunity, provide greater security for all, with no barriers of bigotry or discrimination."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The key to a dynamic decade is vigorous economic growth, our first great goal."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We might well begin with common sense in Federal budgeting: government spending no more than government takes in.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We must bring Federal deficits down.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But how we do that makes all the difference.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can begin by limiting the size and scope of government.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Under the leadership of Vice President Bush, we have reduced the growth of Federal regulations by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hours of government-required paperwork each year."
1984,Reagan,Republican,This will save the public more than $150 billion over the next 10 years.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The Grace commission has given us some 2,500 recommendations for reducing wasteful spending, and they're being examined throughout the administration."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Federal spending growth has been cut from 17.4 percent in 1980 to less than half of that today, and we have already achieved over $300 billion in budget savings for the period of 1982 to '86."
1984,Reagan,Republican,But that's only a little more than half of what we sought.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Government is still spending too large a percentage of the total economy.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Now, some insist that any further budget savings must be obtained by reducing the portion spent on defense."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"This ignores the fact that national defense is solely the responsibility of the Federal Government; indeed, it is its prime responsibility."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And yet defense spending is less than a third of the total budget.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"During the years of President Kennedy and of the years before that, defense was almost half the total budget."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And then came several years in which our military capability was allowed to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We are just now restoring, through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic forces, our capability to meet our present and future security needs."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We dare not shirk our responsibility to keep America free, secure, and at peace."
1984,Reagan,Republican,The last decade saw domestic spending surge literally out of control.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But the basis for such spending had been laid in previous years.
1984,Reagan,Republican,A pattern of overspending has been in place for half a century.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"As the national debt grew, we were told not to worry, that we owed it to ourselves."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Now we know that deficits are a cause for worry.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"But there's a difference of opinion as to whether taxes should be increased, spending cut, or some of both."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Fear is expressed that government borrowing to fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by taking capital needed for business and industrial expansion.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I think that debate is missing an important point."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Whether government borrows or increases taxes, it will be taking the same amount of money from the private sector, and, either way, that's too much."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Simple fairness dictates that government must not raise taxes on families struggling to pay their bills.
1984,Reagan,Republican,The root of the problem is that government's share is more than we can afford if we're to have a sound economy.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We must bring down the deficits to ensure continued economic growth.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"In the budget that I will submit on February 1st, I will recommend measures that will reduce the deficit over the next 5 years."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Many of these will be unfinished business from last year's budget.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Some could be enacted quickly if we could join in a serious effort to address this problem.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I spoke today with Speaker of the House O'Neill, Senate Majority Leader Baker, Senate Minority Leader Byrd, and House Minority Leader Michel."
1984,Reagan,Republican,I asked them if they would designate congressional representatives to meet with representatives of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I know it would take a long, hard struggle to agree on a full-scale plan."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"So, what I have proposed is that we first see if we can agree on a downpayment."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Now, I believe there is basis for such an agreement, one that could reduce the deficits by about a hundred billion dollars over the next 3 years."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We could focus on some of the less contentious spending cuts that are still pending before the Congress.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"These could be combined with measures to close certain tax loopholes, measures that the Treasury Department has previously said to be worthy of support."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"In addition, we could examine the possibility of achieving further outlay savings based on the work of the Grace commission."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"If the congressional leadership is willing, my representatives will be prepared to meet with theirs at the earliest possible time."
1984,Reagan,Republican,I would hope the leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop and enact that downpayment.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But a downpayment alone is not enough to break us out of the deficit problem.
1984,Reagan,Republican,It could help us start on the right path.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Yet, we must do more."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"So, I propose that we begin exploring how together we can make structural reforms to curb the built-in growth of spending."
1984,Reagan,Republican,I also propose improvements in the budgeting process.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Some 43 of our 50 States grant their Governors the right to veto individual items in appropriation bills without having to veto the entire bill.
1984,Reagan,Republican,California is one of those 43 States.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"As Governor, I found this line-item veto was a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending."
1984,Reagan,Republican,It works in 43 States.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Let's put it to work in Washington for all the people.
1984,Reagan,Republican,It would be most effective if done by constitutional amendment.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The majority of Americans approve of such an amendment, just as they and I approve of an amendment mandating a balanced Federal budget."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Many States also have this protection in their constitutions.
1984,Reagan,Republican,To talk of meeting the present situation by increasing taxes is a Band-Aid solution which does nothing to cure an illness that's been coming on for half a century -- to say nothing of the fact that it poses a real threat to economic recovery.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Let's remember that a substantial amount of income tax is presently owed and not paid by people in the underground economy.
1984,Reagan,Republican,It would be immoral to make those who are paying taxes pay more to compensate for those who aren't paying their share.
1984,Reagan,Republican,There's a better way.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Let us go forward with an historic reform for fairness, simplicity, and incentives for growth."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I am asking Secretary Don Regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code, so all taxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And I believe such a plan could result in that underground economy being brought into the sunlight of honest tax compliance.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And it could make the tax base broader, so personal tax rates could come down, not go up."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I've asked that specific recommendations, consistent with those objectives, be presented to me by December 1984."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Our second great goal is to build on America's pioneer spirit -- [laughter] -- I said something funny? [Laughter] I said America's next frontier -- and that's to develop that frontier.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"A sparkling economy spurs initiatives, sunrise industries, and makes older ones more competitive."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Nowhere is this more important than our next frontier: space.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Nowhere do we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make life better on Earth.
1984,Reagan,Republican,The Space Age is barely a quarter of a century old.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But already we've pushed civilization forward with our advances in science and technology.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross new thresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Our progress in space -- taking giant steps for all mankind -- is a tribute to American teamwork and excellence.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Our finest minds in government, industry, and academia have all pulled together."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And we can be proud to say: We are first; we are the best; and we are so because we're free.
1984,Reagan,Republican,America has always been greatest when we dared to be great.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can reach for greatness again.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"A space station will permit quantum leaps in our research in science, communications, in metals, and in lifesaving medicines which could be manufactured only in space."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We want our friends to help us meet these challenges and share in their benefits.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"NASA will invite other countries to participate so we can strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom for all who share our goals."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Just as the oceans opened up a new world for clipper ships and Yankee traders, space holds enormous potential for commerce today."
1984,Reagan,Republican,The market for space transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Companies interested in putting payloads into space must have ready access to private sector launch services.
1984,Reagan,Republican,The Department of Transportation will help an expendable launch services industry to get off the ground.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We'll soon implement a number of executive initiatives, develop proposals to ease regulatory constraints, and, with NASA's help, promote private sector investment in space."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And as we develop the frontier of space, let us remember our responsibility to preserve our older resources here on Earth."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it's common sense."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Though this is a time of budget constraints, I have requested for EPA one of the largest percentage budget increases of any agency."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We will begin the long, necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a special national resource -- the Chesapeake Bay."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"To reduce the threat posed by abandoned hazardous waste dumps, EPA will spend $410 million."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And I will request a supplemental increase of 50 million.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And because the Superfund law expires in 1985, I've asked Bill Ruckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there'll be additional time to complete this important task."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"On the question of acid rain, which concerns people in many areas of the United States and Canada, I'm proposing a research program that doubles our current funding."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And we'll take additional action to restore our lakes and develop new technology to reduce pollution that causes acid rain.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We have greatly improved the conditions of our natural resources.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We'll ask the Congress for $157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park and conservation lands.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The Department of the Interior will encourage careful, selective exploration and production on our vital resources in an Exclusive Economic Zone within the 200-mile limit off our coasts -- but with strict adherence to environmental laws and with fuller State and public participation."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"But our most precious resources, our greatest hope for the future, are the minds and hearts of our people, especially our children."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can help them build tomorrow by strengthening our community of shared values.
1984,Reagan,Republican,This must be our third great goal.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"For us, faith, work, family, neighborhood, freedom, and peace are not just words; they're expressions of what America means, definitions of what makes us a good and loving people."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Families stand at the center of our society.
1984,Reagan,Republican,And every family has a personal stake in promoting excellence in education.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Excellence does not begin in Washington.
1984,Reagan,Republican,A 600-percent increase in Federal spending on education between 1960 and 1980 was accompanied by a steady decline in Scholastic Aptitude Test scores.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Excellence must begin in our homes and neighborhood schools, where it's the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Our children come first, and that's why I established a bipartisan National Commission on Excellence in Education, to help us chart a commonsense course for better education."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And already, communities are implementing the Commission's recommendations."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Schools are reporting progress in math and reading skills.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"But we must do more to restore discipline to schools; and we must encourage the teaching of new basics, reward teachers of merit, enforce tougher standards, and put our parents back in charge."
1984,Reagan,Republican,I will continue to press for tuition tax credits to expand opportunities for families and to soften the double payment for those paying public school taxes and private school tuition.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Our proposal would target assistance to low- and middle-income families.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Just as more incentives are needed within our schools, greater competition is needed among our schools."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Without standards and competition, there can be no champions, no records broken, no excellence in education or any other walk of life."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And while I'm on this subject, each day your Members observe a 200-year-old tradition meant to signify America is one nation under God."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I must ask: If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?"
1984,Reagan,Republican,America was founded by people who believed that God was their rock of safety.
1984,Reagan,Republican,He is ours.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I recognize we must be cautious in claiming that God is on our side, but I think it's all right to keep asking if we're on His side."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"During our first 3 years, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore protection of the law to unborn children."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Now, I know this issue is very controversial."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child is not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof that it isn't?"
1984,Reagan,Republican,"No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the evidence is to the contrary."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We should rise above bitterness and reproach, and if Americans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping, then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Economic recovery, better education, rededication to values, all show the spirit of renewal gaining the upper hand."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And all will improve family life in the eighties.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But families need more.
1984,Reagan,Republican,They need assurance that they and their loved ones can walk the streets of America without being afraid.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Parents need to know their children will not be victims of child pornography and abduction.
1984,Reagan,Republican,This year we will intensify our drive against these and other horrible crimes like sexual abuse and family violence.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Already our efforts to crack down on career criminals, organized crime, drugpushers, and to enforce tougher sentences and paroles are having effect."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"In 1982 the crime rate dropped by 4.3 percent, the biggest decline since 1972."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Protecting victims is just as important as safeguarding the rights of defendants.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Opportunities for all Americans will increase if we move forward in fair housing and work to ensure women's rights, provide for equitable treatment in pension benefits and Individual Retirement Accounts, facilitate child care, and enforce delinquent parent support payments."
1984,Reagan,Republican,It's not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our values and shape our future.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"So, I ask your help in assisting more communities to break the bondage of dependency."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Help us to free enterprise by permitting debate and voting ""yes"" on our proposal for enterprise zones in America."
1984,Reagan,Republican,This has been before you for 2 years.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Its passage can help high-unemployment areas by creating jobs and restoring neighborhoods.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"A society bursting with opportunities, reaching for its future with confidence, sustained by faith, fair play, and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when they're free -- these are the secrets of a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world."
1984,Reagan,Republican,A lasting and meaningful peace is our fourth great goal.
1984,Reagan,Republican,It is our highest aspiration.
1984,Reagan,Republican,And our record is clear: Americans resort to force only when we must.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We have never been aggressors.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We have always struggled to defend freedom and democracy.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We have no territorial ambitions.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We occupy no countries.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We build no walls to lock people in.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Americans build the future.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And our vision of a better life for farmers, merchants, and working people, from the Americas to Asia, begins with a simple premise: The future is best decided by ballots, not bullets."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Governments which rest upon the consent of the governed do not wage war on their neighbors.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Only when people are given a personal stake in deciding their own destiny, benefiting from their own risks, do they create societies that are prosperous, progressive, and free."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, it is democracies that offer hope by feeding the hungry, prolonging life, and eliminating drudgery."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"When it comes to keeping America strong, free, and at peace, there should be no Republicans or Democrats, just patriotic Americans."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We can decide the tough issues not by who is right, but by what is right."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we can continue to advance our agenda for peace."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We can establish a more stable basis for peaceful relations with the Soviet Union; strengthen allied relations across the board; achieve real and equitable reductions in the levels of nuclear arms; reinforce our peacemaking efforts in the Middle East, Central America, and southern Africa; or assist developing countries, particularly our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere; and assist in the development of democratic institutions throughout the world."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"The wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation was seen in the work of the Scowcroft commission, which strengthened our ability to deter war and protect peace."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"In that same spirit, I urge you to move forward with the Henry Jackson plan to implement the recommendations of the Bipartisan Commission on Central America."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon is also serving the cause of peace.
1984,Reagan,Republican,We are making progress in Lebanon.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"For nearly 10 years, the Lebanese have lived from tragedy to tragedy with no hope for their future."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Now the multinational peacekeeping force and our marines are helping them break their cycle of despair.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"There is hope for a free, independent, and sovereign Lebanon."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We must have the courage to give peace a chance.
1984,Reagan,Republican,And we must not be driven from our objectives for peace in Lebanon by state-sponsored terrorism.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We have seen this ugly specter in Beirut, Kuwait, and Rangoon."
1984,Reagan,Republican,It demands international attention.
1984,Reagan,Republican,I will forward shortly legislative proposals to help combat terrorism.
1984,Reagan,Republican,And I will be seeking support from our allies for concerted action.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Our NATO alliance is strong. 1983 was a banner year for political courage.
1984,Reagan,Republican,And we have strengthened our partnerships and our friendships in the Far East.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We're committed to dialog, deterrence, and promoting prosperity."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We'll work with our trading partners for a new round of negotiations in support of freer world trade, greater competition, and more open markets."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"A rebirth of bipartisan cooperation, of economic growth, and military deterrence, and a growing spirit of unity among our people at home and our allies abroad underline a fundamental and far-reaching change: The United States is safer, stronger, and more secure in 1984 than before."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We can now move with confidence to seize the opportunities for peace, and we will."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, I want to speak to the people of the Soviet Union, to tell them it's true that our governments have had serious differences, but our sons and daughters have never fought each other in war."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And if we Americans have our way, they never will."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"People of the Soviet Union, there is only one sane policy, for your country and mine, to preserve our civilization in this modern age: A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."
1984,Reagan,Republican,The only value in our two nations possessing nuclear weapons is to make sure they will never be used.
1984,Reagan,Republican,But then would it not be better to do away with them entirely?
1984,Reagan,Republican,"People of the Soviet, President Dwight Eisenhower, who fought by your side in World War II, said the essential struggle ""is not merely man against man or nation against nation."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"It is man against war."" Americans are people of peace."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"If your government wants peace, there will be peace."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We can come together in faith and friendship to build a safer and far better world for our children and our children's children.
1984,Reagan,Republican,And the whole world will rejoice.
1984,Reagan,Republican,That is my message to you.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Some days when life seems hard and we reach out for values to sustain us or a friend to help us, we find a person who reminds us what it means to be Americans."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Sergeant Stephen Trujillo, a medic in the 2d Ranger Battalion, 75th Infantry, was in the first helicopter to land at the compound held by Cuban forces in Grenada."
1984,Reagan,Republican,He saw three other helicopters crash.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Despite the imminent explosion of the burning aircraft, he never hesitated."
1984,Reagan,Republican,He ran across 25 yards of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wounded soldiers.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"He directed two other medics, administered first aid, and returned again and again to the crash site to carry his wounded friends to safety."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Sergeant Trujillo, you and your fellow service men and women not only saved innocent lives; you set a nation free."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"You inspire us as a force for freedom, not for despotism; and, yes, for peace, not conquest."
1984,Reagan,Republican,God bless you.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"And then there are unsung heroes: single parents, couples, church and civic volunteers."
1984,Reagan,Republican,Their hearts carry without complaint the pains of family and community problems.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"They soothe our sorrow, heal our wounds, calm our fears, and share our joy."
1984,Reagan,Republican,A person like Father Ritter is always there.
1984,Reagan,Republican,His Covenant House programs in New York and Houston provide shelter and help to thousands of frightened and abused children each year.
1984,Reagan,Republican,The same is true of Dr.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Charles Carson.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Paralyzed in a plane crash, he still believed nothing is impossible."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Today in Minnesota, he works 80 hours a week without pay, helping pioneer the field of computer-controlled walking."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"He has given hope to 500,000 paralyzed Americans that some day they may walk again."
1984,Reagan,Republican,How can we not believe in the greatness of America?
1984,Reagan,Republican,How can we not do what is right and needed to preserve this last best hope of man on Earth?
1984,Reagan,Republican,"After all our struggles to restore America, to revive confidence in our country, hope for our future, after all our hard-won victories earned through the patience and courage of every citizen, we cannot, must not, and will not turn back."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We will finish our job.
1984,Reagan,Republican,How could we do less?
1984,Reagan,Republican,We're Americans.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Carl Sandburg said, ""I see America not in the setting sun of a black night of despair . . ."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I see America in the crimson light of a rising sun fresh from the burning, creative hand of God . . ."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"I see great days ahead for men and women of will and vision."" I've never felt more strongly that America's best days and democracy's best days lie ahead."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We're a powerful force for good.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"With faith and courage, we can perform great deeds and take freedom's next step."
1984,Reagan,Republican,And we will.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"We will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have brought light where there was darkness, warmth where there was cold, medicine where there was disease, food where there was hunger, and peace where there was only bloodshed."
1984,Reagan,Republican,"Let us be sure that those who come after will say of us in our time, that in our time we did everything that could be done."
1984,Reagan,Republican,We finished the race; we kept them free; we kept the faith.
1984,Reagan,Republican,Thank you very much.
1984,Reagan,Republican,"God bless you, and God bless America."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION February 6, 1985 Mr."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: I come before you to report on the state of our Union, and I'm pleased to report that after 4 years of united effort, the American people have brought forth a nation renewed, stronger, freer, and more secure than before."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Four years ago we began to change, forever I hope, our assumptions about government and its place in our lives."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Out of that change has come great and robust growth -- in our confidence, our economy, and our role in the world."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Tonight America is stronger because of the values that we hold dear.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We believe faith and freedom must be our guiding stars, for they show us truth, they make us brave, give us hope, and leave us wiser than we were."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Our progress began not in Washington, DC, but in the hearts of our families, communities, workplaces, and voluntary groups which, together, are unleashing the invincible spirit of one great nation under God."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Four years ago we said we would invigorate our economy by giving people greater freedom and incentives to take risks and letting them keep more of what they earned.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We did what we promised, and a great industrial giant is reborn."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight we can take pride in 25 straight months of economic growth, the strongest in 34 years; a 3-year inflation average of 3.9 percent, the lowest in 17 years; and 7.3 million new jobs in 2 years, with more of our citizens working than ever before."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"New freedom in our lives has planted the rich seeds for future success: For an America of wisdom that honors the family, knowing that if [as] the family goes, so goes our civilization; For an America of vision that sees tomorrow's dreams in the learning and hard work we do today; For an America of courage whose service men and women, even as we meet, proudly stand watch on the frontiers of freedom; For an America of compassion that opens its heart to those who cry out for help."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We have begun well.
1985,Reagan,Republican,But it's only a beginning.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We're not here to congratulate ourselves on what we have done but to challenge ourselves to finish what has not yet been done.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We're here to speak for millions in our inner cities who long for real jobs, safe neighborhoods, and schools that truly teach."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We're here to speak for the American farmer, the entrepreneur, and every worker in industries fighting to modernize and compete."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And, yes, we're here to stand, and proudly so, for all who struggle to break free from totalitarianism, for all who know in their hearts that freedom is the one true path to peace and human happiness."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Proverbs tell us, without a vision the people perish."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"When asked what great principle holds our Union together, Abraham Lincoln said: ``Something in [the] Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time.'' We honor the giants of our history not by going back but forward to the dreams their vision foresaw."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"My fellow citizens, this nation is poised for greatness."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"The time has come to proceed toward a great new challenge -- a second American Revolution of hope and opportunity; a revolution carrying us to new heights of progress by pushing back frontiers of knowledge and space; a revolution of spirit that taps the soul of America, enabling us to summon greater strength than we've ever known; and a revolution that carries beyond our shores the golden promise of human freedom in a world of peace."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Let us begin by challenging our conventional wisdom.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"There are no constraints on the human mind, no walls around the human spirit, no barriers to our progress except those we ourselves erect."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Already, pushing down tax rates has freed our economy to vault forward to record growth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"In Europe, they're calling it ``the American Miracle.'' Day by day, we're shattering accepted notions of what is possible."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"When I was growing up, we failed to see how a new thing called radio would transform our marketplace."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Well, today, many have not yet seen how advances in technology are transforming our lives."
1985,Reagan,Republican,In the late 1950's workers at the AT&T semiconductor plant in Pennsylvania produced five transistors a day for $7.50 apiece.
1985,Reagan,Republican,They now produce over a million for less than a penny apiece.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"New laser techniques could revolutionize heart bypass surgery, cut diagnosis time for viruses linked to cancer from weeks to minutes, reduce hospital costs dramatically, and hold out new promise for saving human lives."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Our automobile industry has overhauled assembly lines, increased worker productivity, and is competitive once again."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more, do more, be more."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our economy is not getting older and weaker; it's getting younger and stronger.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"It doesn't need rest and supervision; it needs new challenge, greater freedom."
1985,Reagan,Republican,And that word ``freedom'' is the key to the second American revolution that we need to bring about.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Let us move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Last year I asked Treasury Secretary -- then -- Regan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code, so all taxpayers would be treated more fairly and personal tax rates could come further down."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We have cut tax rates by almost 25 percent, yet the tax system remains unfair and limits our potential for growth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Exclusions and exemptions cause similar incomes to be taxed at different levels.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Low-income families face steep tax barriers that make hard lives even harder.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"The Treasury Department has produced an excellent reform plan, whose principles will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact."
1985,Reagan,Republican,One thing that tax reform will not be is a tax increase in disguise.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that families need.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We will reduce personal tax rates as low as possible by removing many tax preferences.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent, and possibly lower."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And we will propose reducing corporate rates, while maintaining incentives for capital formation."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"To encourage opportunity and jobs rather than dependency and welfare, we will propose that individuals living at or near the poverty line be totally exempt from Federal income tax."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"To restore fairness to families, we will propose increasing significantly the personal exemption."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And tonight, I am instructing Treasury Secretary James Baker -- I have to get used to saying that -- to begin working with congressional authors and committees for bipartisan legislation conforming to these principles."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We will call upon the American people for support and upon every man and woman in this Chamber.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we can pass, this year, a tax bill for fairness, simplicity, and growth, making this economy the engine of our dreams and America the investment capital of the world."
1985,Reagan,Republican,So let us begin.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleashing the tremendous pent-up power of our economy.
1985,Reagan,Republican,But a second American revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all.
1985,Reagan,Republican,It is time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country.
1985,Reagan,Republican,This government will meet its responsibility to help those in need.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"But policies that increase dependency, break up families, and destroy self-respect are not progressive; they're reactionary."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Despite our strides in civil rights, blacks, Hispanics, and all minorities will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We have repeatedly sought passage of enterprise zones to help those in the abandoned corners of our land find jobs, learn skills, and build better lives."
1985,Reagan,Republican,This legislation is supported by a majority of you.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Mr.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, I know we agree that there must be no forgotten Americans."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Let us place new dreams in a million hearts and create a new generation of entrepreneurs by passing enterprise zones this year.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And, Tip, you could make that a birthday present. [Laughter] Nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We can help teenagers, who have the highest unemployment rate, find summer jobs, so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their futures."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We'll continue to support the Job Training Partnership Act, which has a nearly two-thirds job placement rate."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Credits in education and health care vouchers will help working families shop for services that they need.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our administration is already encouraging certain low-income public housing residents to own and manage their own dwellings.
1985,Reagan,Republican,It's time that all public housing residents have that opportunity of ownership.
1985,Reagan,Republican,The Federal Government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"But States and localities, many of which enjoy surpluses from the recovery, must not permit their tax and regulatory policies to stand as barriers to growth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Let us resolve that we will stop spreading dependency and start spreading opportunity; that we will stop spreading bondage and start spreading freedom.
1985,Reagan,Republican,There are some who say that growth initiatives must await final action on deficit reductions.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Well, the best way to reduce deficits is through economic growth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"More businesses will be started, more investments made, more jobs created, and more people will be on payrolls paying taxes."
1985,Reagan,Republican,The best way to reduce government spending is to reduce the need for spending by increasing prosperity.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Each added percentage point per year of real GNP growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficits of nearly $200 billion over 5 years.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"To move steadily toward a balanced budget, we must also lighten government's claim on our total economy."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We will not do this by raising taxes.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We must make sure that our economy grows faster than the growth in spending by the Federal Government.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"In our fiscal year 1986 budget, overall government program spending will be frozen at the current level."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"It must not be one dime higher than fiscal year 1985, and three points are key."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"First, the social safety net for the elderly, the needy, the disabled, and unemployed will be left intact."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Growth of our major health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid, will be slowed, but protections for the elderly and needy will be preserved."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Second, we must not relax our efforts to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equipped, trained, and ready professional corps."
1985,Reagan,Republican,National security is government's first responsibility; so in past years defense spending took about half the Federal budget.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Today it takes less than a third.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We've already reduced our planned defense expenditures by nearly a hundred billion dollars over the past 4 years and reduced projected spending again this year.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"You know, we only have a military-industrial complex until a time of danger, and then it becomes the arsenal of democracy."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Spending for defense is investing in things that are priceless -- peace and freedom.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Third, we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidies."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"For example, deregulation of the airline industry has led to cheaper airfares, but on Amtrak taxpayers pay about $35 per passenger every time an Amtrak train leaves the station."
1985,Reagan,Republican,It's time we ended this huge Federal subsidy.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our farm program costs have quadrupled in recent years.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Yet I know from visiting farmers, many in great financial distress, that we need an orderly transition to a market-oriented farm economy."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We can help farmers best not by expanding Federal payments but by making fundamental reforms, keeping interest rates heading down, and knocking down foreign trade barriers to American farm exports."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We're moving ahead with Grace commission reforms to eliminate waste and improve government's management practices.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"In the long run, we must protect the taxpayers from government."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And I ask again that you pass, as 32 States have now called for, an amendment mandating the Federal Government spend no more than it takes in."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And I ask for the authority, used responsibly by 43 Governors, to veto individual items in appropriation bills."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Senator Mattingly has introduced a bill permitting a 2-year trial run of the line-item veto.
1985,Reagan,Republican,I hope you'll pass and send that legislation to my desk.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Nearly 50 years of government living beyond its means has brought us to a time of reckoning.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Ours is but a moment in history.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"But one moment of courage, idealism, and bipartisan unity can change American history forever."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Sound monetary policy is key to long-running economic strength and stability.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We will continue to cooperate with the Federal Reserve Board, seeking a steady policy that ensures price stability without keeping interest rates artificially high or needlessly holding down growth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Reducing unneeded redtape and regulations, and deregulating the energy, transportation, and financial industries have unleashed new competition, giving consumers more choices, better services, and lower prices."
1985,Reagan,Republican,In just one set of grant programs we have reduced 905 pages of regulations to 31.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supplies and bring us closer to energy independence.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Consistent with safety standards, we will continue removing restraints on the bus and railroad industries, we will soon end up legislation -- or send up legislation, I should say -- to return Conrail to the private sector where it belongs, and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Every dollar the Federal Government does not take from us, every decision it does not make for us will make our economy stronger, our lives more abundant, our future more free."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our second American revolution will push on to new possibilities not only on Earth but in the next frontier of space.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Despite budget restraints, we will seek record funding for research and development."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We've seen the success of the space shuttle.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Now we're going to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunities for free enterprise, because in the next decade Americans and our friends around the world will be living and working together in space."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"In the zero gravity of space, we could manufacture in 30 days lifesaving medicines it would take 30 years to make on Earth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We can make crystals of exceptional purity to produce super computers, creating jobs, technologies, and medical breakthroughs beyond anything we ever dreamed possible."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"As we do all this, we'll continue to protect our natural resources."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We will seek reauthorization and expanded funding for the Superfund program to continue cleaning up hazardous waste sites which threaten human health and the environment.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Now, there's another great heritage to speak of this evening."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Of all the changes that have swept America the past 4 years, none brings greater promise than our rediscovery of the values of faith, freedom, family, work, and neighborhood."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We see signs of renewal in increased attendance in places of worship; renewed optimism and faith in our future; love of country rediscovered by our young, who are leading the way."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We've rediscovered that work is good in and of itself, that it ennobles us to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our jobs."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We've seen a powerful new current from an old and honorable tradition -- American generosity.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"From thousands answering Peace Corps appeals to help boost food production in Africa, to millions volunteering time, corporations adopting schools, and communities pulling together to help the neediest among us at home, we have refound our values."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Private sector initiatives are crucial to our future.
1985,Reagan,Republican,I thank the Congress for passing equal access legislation giving religious groups the same right to use classrooms after school that other groups enjoy.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"But no citizen need tremble, nor the world shudder, if a child stands in a classroom and breathes a prayer."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We ask you again, give children back a right they had for a century and a half or more in this country."
1985,Reagan,Republican,The question of abortion grips our nation.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Abortion is either the taking of a human life or it isn't.
1985,Reagan,Republican,And if it is -- and medical technology is increasingly showing it is -- it must be stopped.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"It is a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We have room for these children.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love.
1985,Reagan,Republican,And tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"In the area of education, we're returning to excellence, and again, the heroes are our people, not government."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We're stressing basics of discipline, rigorous testing, and homework, while helping children become computer-smart as well."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"For 20 years scholastic aptitude test scores of our high school students went down, but now they have gone up 2 of the last 3 years."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We must go forward in our commitment to the new basics, giving parents greater authority and making sure good teachers are rewarded for hard work and achievement through merit pay."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Of all the changes in the past 20 years, none has more threatened our sense of national well-being than the explosion of violent crime."
1985,Reagan,Republican,One does not have to be attacked to be a victim.
1985,Reagan,Republican,The woman who must run to her car after shopping at night is a victim.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"The couple draping their door with locks and chains are victims; as is the tired, decent cleaning woman who can't ride a subway home without being afraid."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We do not seek to violate the rights of defendants.
1985,Reagan,Republican,But shouldn't we feel more compassion for the victims of crime than for those who commit crime?
1985,Reagan,Republican,"For the first time in 20 years, the crime index has fallen 2 years in a row."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We've convicted over 7,400 drug offenders and put them, as well as leaders of organized crime, behind bars in record numbers."
1985,Reagan,Republican,But we must do more.
1985,Reagan,Republican,I urge the House to follow the Senate and enact proposals permitting use of all reliable evidence that police officers acquire in good faith.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"These proposals would also reform the habeas corpus laws and allow, in keeping with the will of the overwhelming majority of Americans, the use of the death penalty where necessary."
1985,Reagan,Republican,There can be no economic revival in ghettos when the most violent among us are allowed to roam free.
1985,Reagan,Republican,It's time we restored domestic tranquility.
1985,Reagan,Republican,And we mean to do just that.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Just as we're positioned as never before to secure justice in our economy, we're poised as never before to create a safer, freer, more peaceful world."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our alliances are stronger than ever.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our economy is stronger than ever.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We have resumed our historic role as a leader of the free world.
1985,Reagan,Republican,And all of these together are a great force for peace.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Since 1981 we've been committed to seeking fair and verifiable arms agreements that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenals.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Now our determination to maintain a strong defense has influenced the Soviet Union to return to the bargaining table.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our negotiators must be able to go to that table with the united support of the American people.
1985,Reagan,Republican,All of us have no greater dream than to see the day when nuclear weapons are banned from this Earth forever.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Each Member of the Congress has a role to play in modernizing our defenses, thus supporting our chances for a meaningful arms agreement."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Your vote this spring on the Peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arms reductions.
1985,Reagan,Republican,For the past 20 years we've believed that no war will be launched as long as each side knows it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I believe there's a better way of eliminating the threat of nuclear war."
1985,Reagan,Republican,It is a Strategic Defense Initiative aimed ultimately at finding a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missiles.
1985,Reagan,Republican,It's the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age.
1985,Reagan,Republican,But it's not very well understood.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Some say it will bring war to the heavens, but its purpose is to deter war in the heavens and on Earth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Now, some say the research would be expensive."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Perhaps, but it could save millions of lives, indeed humanity itself."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And some say if we build such a system, the Soviets will build a defense system of their own."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Well, they already have strategic defenses that surpass ours; a civil defense system, where we have almost none; and a research program covering roughly the same areas of technology that we're now exploring."
1985,Reagan,Republican,And finally some say the research will take a long time.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Well, the answer to that is: Let's get started."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Harry Truman once said that, ultimately, our security and the world's hopes for peace and human progress ``lie not in measures of defense or in the control of weapons, but in the growth and expansion of freedom and self-government.'' And tonight, we declare anew to our fellow citizens of the world: Freedom is not the sole prerogative of a chosen few; it is the universal right of all God's children."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Look to where peace and prosperity flourish today.
1985,Reagan,Republican,It is in homes that freedom built.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Victories against poverty are greatest and peace most secure where people live by laws that ensure free press, free speech, and freedom to worship, vote, and create wealth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Our mission is to nourish and defend freedom and democracy, and to communicate these ideals everywhere we can."
1985,Reagan,Republican,America's economic success is freedom's success; it can be repeated a hundred times in a hundred different nations.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Many countries in east Asia and the Pacific have few resources other than the enterprise of their own people.
1985,Reagan,Republican,But through low tax rates and free markets they've soared ahead of centralized economies.
1985,Reagan,Republican,And now China is opening up its economy to meet its needs.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"We need a stronger and simpler approach to the process of making and implementing trade policy, and we'll be studying potential changes in that process in the next few weeks."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We've seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight I ask all our trading partners, developed and developing alike, to join us in a new round of trade negotiations to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economy -- and to begin it in this next year."
1985,Reagan,Republican,There are more than 3 billion human beings living in Third World countries with an average per capita income of $650 a year.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Many are victims of dictatorships that impoverished them with taxation and corruption.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Let us ask our allies to join us in a practical program of trade and assistance that fosters economic development through personal incentives to help these people climb from poverty on their own.
1985,Reagan,Republican,We cannot play innocents abroad in a world that's not innocent; nor can we be passive when freedom is under seige.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Without resources, diplomacy cannot succeed."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Our security assistance programs help friendly governments defend themselves and give them confidence to work for peace.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And I hope that you in the Congress will understand that, dollar for dollar, security assistance contributes as much to global security as our own defense budget."
1985,Reagan,Republican,We must stand by all our democratic allies.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives -- on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua -- to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"The Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban-Soviet bloc support, not only persecutes its people, the church, and denies a free press, but arms and provides bases for Communist terrorists attacking neighboring states."
1985,Reagan,Republican,Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and totally consistent with the OAS and U.N.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Charters.
1985,Reagan,Republican,It is essential that the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to Central America.
1985,Reagan,Republican,I want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied to our own security.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And tonight, I've spoken of great plans and great dreams."
1985,Reagan,Republican,They're dreams we can make come true.
1985,Reagan,Republican,Two hundred years of American history should have taught us that nothing is impossible.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Ten years ago a young girl left Vietnam with her family, part of the exodus that followed the fall of Saigon."
1985,Reagan,Republican,They came to the United States with no possessions and not knowing a word of English.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Ten years ago -- the young girl studied hard, learned English, and finished high school in the top of her class."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"And this May, May 22d to be exact, is a big date on her calendar."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Just 10 years from the time she left Vietnam, she will graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point."
1985,Reagan,Republican,I thought you might like to meet an American hero named Jean Nguyen.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Now, there's someone else here tonight, born 79 years ago."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"She lives in the inner city, where she cares for infants born of mothers who are heroin addicts."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"The children, born in withdrawal, are sometimes even dropped on her doorstep."
1985,Reagan,Republican,She helps them with love.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Go to her house some night, and maybe you'll see her silhouette against the window as she walks the floor talking softly, soothing a child in her arms -- Mother Hale of Harlem, and she, too, is an American hero."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Jean, Mother Hale, your lives tell us that the oldest American saying is new again: Anything is possible in America if we have the faith, the will, and the heart."
1985,Reagan,Republican,History is asking us once again to be a force for good in the world.
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Let us begin in unity, with justice, and love."
1985,Reagan,Republican,"Thank you, and God bless you."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION February 4, 1986 Mr."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of the Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Thank you for allowing me to delay my address until this evening."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We paused together to mourn and honor the valor of our seven Challenger heroes.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And I hope that we are now ready to do what they would want us to do: Go forward, America, and reach for the stars."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We will never forget those brave seven, but we shall go forward."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Mr.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, before I begin my prepared remarks, may I point out that tonight marks the 10th and last State of the Union Message that you've presided over."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And on behalf of the American people, I want to salute you for your service to Congress and country."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Here's to you! [Applause] I have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of unfinished work, and to set our sights on the future."
1986,Reagan,Republican,I am pleased to report the state of our Union is stronger than a year ago and growing stronger each day.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight we look out on a rising America, firm of heart, united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism."
1986,Reagan,Republican,America is on the move!
1986,Reagan,Republican,"But it wasn't long ago that we looked out on a different land: locked factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices, and interest rates turning the greatest country on Earth into a land of broken dreams."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant, slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom."
1986,Reagan,Republican,What brought America back?
1986,Reagan,Republican,"The American people brought us back with quiet courage and common sense, with undying faith that in this nation under God the future will be ours; for the future belongs to the free."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight the American people deserve our thanks for 37 straight months of economic growth, for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9 million new jobs in 3 years, interest rates cut in half, inflation falling over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today, and a mighty river of good works -- a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community remain the moral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for the future."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Family and community are the costars of this great American comeback.
1986,Reagan,Republican,They are why we say tonight: Private values must be at the heart of public policies.
1986,Reagan,Republican,What is true for families in America is true for America in the family of free nations.
1986,Reagan,Republican,History is no captive of some inevitable force.
1986,Reagan,Republican,History is made by men and women of vision and courage.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Tonight freedom is on the march.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"The United States is the economic miracle, the model to which the world once again turns."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We stand for an idea whose time is now: Only by lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nations be secure.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Teddy Roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when Everest beckons."
1986,Reagan,Republican,It's time for America to be all that we can be.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We speak tonight of an agenda for the future, an agenda for a safer, more secure world."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And we speak about the necessity for actions to steel us for the challenges of growth, trade, and security in the next decade and the year 2000."
1986,Reagan,Republican,And we will do it -- not by breaking faith with bedrock principles but by breaking free from failed policies.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Let us begin where storm clouds loom darkest -- right here in Washington, DC."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"This week I will send you our detailed proposals; tonight let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government's role: not to control, not to demand or command, not to contain us, but to help in times of need and, above all, to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all Americans can climb toward economic power and justice on their own."
1986,Reagan,Republican,But we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can't even pass a Federal budget.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We cannot win that race held back by horse-and-buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human potential.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We cannot win that race if we're swamped in a sea of red ink.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Now, Mr."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, you know, I know, and the American people know the Federal budget system is broken."
1986,Reagan,Republican,It doesn't work.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Before we leave this city, let's you and I work together to fix it, and then we can finally give the American people a balanced budget."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Members of Congress, passage of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings gives us an historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for decades: forcing the Federal Government to live within its means."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by April 15th, the very day America's families have to foot the bill for the budgets that you produce."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"How often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxes and bills."
1986,Reagan,Republican,And yet some in Congress say taxes must be raised.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I'm sorry; they're asking the wrong people to tighten their belts."
1986,Reagan,Republican,It's time we reduce the Federal budget and left the family budget alone.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We do not face large deficits because American families are undertaxed; we face those deficits because the Federal Government overspends.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"The detailed budget that we will submit will meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target for deficit reductions, meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense, meet our commitment to protect Social Security and the truly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our commitment to not raise taxes."
1986,Reagan,Republican,How should we accomplish this?
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Well, not by taking from those in need."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"As families take care of their own, government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"But we must revise or replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entire communities into a bleak and heartless dependency."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Gramm-Rudman-Hollings can mark a dramatic improvement.
1986,Reagan,Republican,But experience shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they'll be met.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We must proceed with Grace commission reforms against waste.
1986,Reagan,Republican,And tonight I ask you to give me what 43 Governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"This authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own merit."
1986,Reagan,Republican,And you can sustain or override my veto; that's the way the system should work.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Once we've made the hard choices, we should lock in our gains with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution."
1986,Reagan,Republican,I mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We must meet it.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Defense is not just another budget expense.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Keeping America strong, free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the Federal Government; it is government's prime responsibility."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We have devoted 5 years trying to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect, and we've made important gains."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Yet the threat from Soviet forces, conventional and strategic, from the Soviet drive for domination, from the increase in espionage and state terror remains great."
1986,Reagan,Republican,This is reality.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Closing our eyes will not make reality disappear.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We pledged together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare minimum.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"My budget honors that pledge, and I'm now asking you, the Congress, to keep its end of the bargain."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"The Soviets must know that if America reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a reduced resolve."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Keeping America strong is as vital to the national security as controlling Federal spending is to our economic security.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"But, as I have said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the Federal deficit is an ever-expanding American economy, unfettered and free."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"The magic of opportunity -- unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained -- isn't this the calling that unites us?"
1986,Reagan,Republican,I believe our tax rate cuts for the people have done more to spur a spirit of risk-taking and help America's economy break free than any program since John Kennedy's tax cut almost a quarter century ago.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Now history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay their fair share, but no more."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We've come this far.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Will you join me now, and we'll walk this last mile together?"
1986,Reagan,Republican,You know my views on this.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We cannot and we will not accept tax reform that is a tax increase in disguise.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"True reform must be an engine of productivity and growth, and that means a top personal rate no higher than 35 percent."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"True reform must be truly fair, and that means raising personal exemptions to $2,000."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"True reform means a tax system that at long last is profamily, projobs, profuture, and pro-America."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"As we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts for freer and fairer trade."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We have already taken actions to counter unfair trading practices and to pry open closed foreign markets.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We will continue to do so.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in reality pits one American worker against another, one industry against another, one community against another, and that raises prices for us all."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"If the United States can trade with other nations on a level playing field, we can outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anywhere in the world."
1986,Reagan,Republican,The constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We must never again permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other exporters.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Farmers, in particular, have suffered from past unwise government policies."
1986,Reagan,Republican,They must not be abandoned with problems they did not create and cannot control.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We've begun coordinating economic and monetary policy among our major trading partners.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"But there's more to do, and tonight I am directing Treasury Secretary Jim Baker to determine if the nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currencies."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Confident in our future and secure in our values, Americans are striving forward to embrace the future."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We see it not only in our recovery but in 3 straight years of falling crime rates, as families and communities band together to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness and to give back to their children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they deserve."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We see it in the renaissance in education, the rising SAT scores for 3 years -- last year's increase, the greatest since 1963."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"It wasn't government and Washington lobbies that turned education around; it was the American people who, in reaching for excellence, knew to reach back to basics."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools, vouchers that give parents freedom of choice; and we must give back to our children their lost right to acknowledge God in their classrooms."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We are a nation of idealists, yet today there is a wound in our national conscience."
1986,Reagan,Republican,America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"For the rest of my time, I shall do what I can to see that this wound is one day healed."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"As we work to make the American dream real for all, we must also look to the condition of America's families."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Struggling parents today worry how they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave them.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"In the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic support system, has reached crisis proportions -- in female and child poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes, and deteriorating schools."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"After hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of the poor grows more painful."
1986,Reagan,Republican,But the waste in dollars and cents pales before the most tragic loss: the sinful waste of human spirit and potential.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We can ignore this terrible truth no longer.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"As Franklin Roosevelt warned 51 years ago, standing before this Chamber, he said, ``Welfare is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.'' And we must now escape the spider's web of dependency."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight I am charging the White House Domestic Council to present me by December 1, 1986, an evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the financial, educational, social, and safety concerns of poor families."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"I'm talking about real and lasting emancipation, because the success of welfare should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Further, after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family, I am directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Otis Bowen, to report to me by year end with recommendations on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And tonight I want to speak directly to America's younger generation, because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"With all the temptations young people face, it sometimes seems the allure of the permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"But the call of the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in the blind alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"As they said in the film ``Back to the Future,'' ``Where we're going, we don't need roads.'' Well, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Astronomers build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"So, yes, this nation remains fully committed to America's space program."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We're going forward with our shuttle flights.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We're going forward to build our space station.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And we are going forward with research on a new Orient Express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles Airport, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within 2 hours."
1986,Reagan,Republican,And the same technology transforming our lives can solve the greatest problem of the 20th century.
1986,Reagan,Republican,A security shield can one day render nuclear weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror.
1986,Reagan,Republican,America met one historic challenge and went to the Moon.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Now America must meet another: to make our strategic defense real for all the citizens of planet Earth.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Let us speak of our deepest longing for the future: to leave our children a land that is free and just and a world at peace.
1986,Reagan,Republican,It is my hope that our fireside summit in Geneva and Mr.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Gorbachev's upcoming visit to America can lead to a more stable relationship.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Surely no people on Earth hate war or love peace more than we Americans.
1986,Reagan,Republican,But we cannot stroll into the future with childlike faith.
1986,Reagan,Republican,Our differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged right to command people's lives and to export its ideology by force are deep and abiding.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by realism -- rock-hard, clear-eyed, steady, and sure."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Our negotiators in Geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side with no cheating.
1986,Reagan,Republican,They have made clear that Soviet compliance with the letter and spirit of agreements is essential.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"If the Soviet Government wants an agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be such an agreement."
1986,Reagan,Republican,But arms control is no substitute for peace.
1986,Reagan,Republican,We know that peace follows in freedom's path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is denied.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"So, we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by bolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we can."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf of lower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the world."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with allies and come to the aid of friends under siege.
1986,Reagan,Republican,And we can enlarge the family of free nations if we will defend the unalienable rights of all God's children to follow their dreams.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"To those imprisoned in regimes held captive, to those beaten for daring to fight for freedom and democracy -- for their right to worship, to speak, to live, and to prosper in the family of free nations -- we say to you tonight: You are not alone, freedom fighters."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"America will support with moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but to fight and win freedom -- to win freedom in Afghanistan, in Angola, in Cambodia, and in Nicaragua."
1986,Reagan,Republican,This is a great moral challenge for the entire free world.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Surely no issue is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the security of our frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests, than to achieve democracy in Nicaragua and to protect Nicaragua's democratic neighbors."
1986,Reagan,Republican,This year I will be asking Congress for the means to do what must be done for that great and good cause.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"As [former Senator Henry M.] Scoop Jackson, the inspiration for our Bipartisan Commission on Central America, once said, ``In matters of national security, the best politics is no politics.'' What we accomplish this year, in each challenge we face, will set our course for the balance of the decade, indeed, for the remainder of the century."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"After all we've done so far, let no one say that this nation cannot reach the destiny of our dreams."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"America believes, America is ready, America can win the race to the future -- and we shall."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"The American dream is a song of hope that rings through night winter air; vivid, tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us aspire to the greatest things: to venture a daring enterprise; to unearth new beauty in music, literature, and art; to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell."
1986,Reagan,Republican,We see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of Richard Cavoli.
1986,Reagan,Republican,All his life he's been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And, Richard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school was launched and lost last week, yet your dream lives."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And as long as it's real, work of noble note will yet be done, work that could reduce the harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the golden gateways of the farthest stars."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We see the dream glow in the towering talent of a 12-year-old, Tyrone Ford."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"A child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer."
1986,Reagan,Republican,He also directs the choirs of three churches and has performed at the Kennedy Center.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"With God as your composer, Tyrone, your music will be the music of angels."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We see the dream being saved by the courage of the 13-year-old Shelby Butler, honor student and member of her school's safety patrol."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Seeing another girl freeze in terror before an out-of-control school bus, she risked her life and pulled her to safety."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"With bravery like yours, Shelby, America need never fear for our future."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"And we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year old, Trevor Ferrell."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Two years ago, age 11, watching men and women bedding down in abandoned doorways -- on television he was watching -- Trevor left his suburban Philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the helpless and homeless."
1986,Reagan,Republican,And now 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Trevor, yours is the living spirit of brotherly love."
1986,Reagan,Republican,Would you four stand up for a moment?
1986,Reagan,Republican,"Thank you, thank you."
1986,Reagan,Republican,You are heroes of our hearts.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"We look at you and know it's true: In this land of dreams fulfilled, where greater dreams may be imagined, nothing is impossible, no victory is beyond our reach, no glory will ever be too great."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"So, now it's up to us, all of us, to prepare America for that day when our work will pale before the greatness of America's champions in the 21st century."
1986,Reagan,Republican,The world's hopes rest with America's future; America's hopes rest with us.
1986,Reagan,Republican,"So, let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, in unity, and in love."
1986,Reagan,Republican,"God bless you, and God bless America."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 27, 1987 Thank you very much."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Mr.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"President, distinguished members of Congress, honored guests and fellow citizens."
1987,Reagan,Republican,May I congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th Congress of the United States of America.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"In this 200th anniversary year of our Constitution, you and I stand on the shoulders of giants--men whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"However, we must always remember that our Constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young--young with the same energy, spirit, and promise that filled each eventful day in Philadelphia's State House."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We will be guided tonight by their acts; and we will be guided forever by their words.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now, forgive me, but I can't resist sharing a story from those historic days."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787, and its newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the Convention delegates with elaborate social classifications."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Governors of states were called ""Excellency."" Justices and Chancellors had reserved for them ""Honorable"" with a capital ""H."" For Congressmen, it was ""honorable"" with a small ""h."" And all others were referred to as ""the following respectable characters."" Well, for this 100th Congress, I invoke special Executive powers to declare that each of you must never be titled less than Honorable with a capital ""H."" Incidentally, I'm delighted you're celebrating the 100th birthday of the Congress."
1987,Reagan,Republican,It's always a pleasure to congratulate someone with more birthdays than I've had.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now, there's a new face at this place of honor tonight."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And please join me in warm congratulations to the Speaker of the House, Jim Wright."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Mr.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, you might recall a similar situation in your very first session of Congress, 32 years ago."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Then, as now, the Speakership had changed hands and another great son of Texas, Sam Rayburn--""Mr."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Sam""--sat in your chair."
1987,Reagan,Republican,I cannot find better words than those used by President Eisenhower that evening.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"He said, ""We shall have much to do together; I am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and goodwill."" Tonight, I renew that pledge."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"To you, Mr."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, and to Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the Congress, may I say: though there are changes in the Congress, America's interests remain the same."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And I am confident that, along with Republican leaders Bob Michel and Bob Dole, this Congress can make history."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Six Years ago, I was here to ask the Congress.to join me in America's New Beginning."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, the results are something of which we can all be proud."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Our inflation rate is now the lowest in a in a quarter of a century.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The prime interest rate has fallen from the 21 and a half percent the month before we took office to seven and a half percent today, and those rates have triggered the most housing starts in eight years."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The unemployment rate--still too high--is the lowest in nearly seven years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16, male and female, is employed the highest percentagc on record."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Let's roll up our sleeves and go to work, and put America's economic engine at full throttle."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We can also be heartened by our progress across the world.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Most important, America is at peace tonight, and freedom is on the march."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And we've done much these past years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Our sons and daughters in the services once again wear their uniforms with pride.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But though we've made much progress, I have one major regret."
1987,Reagan,Republican,I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"It did not work, and for that I assume full responsibility."
1987,Reagan,Republican,The goals were worthy.
1987,Reagan,Republican,I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives.
1987,Reagan,Republican,And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But in debating the past --in debating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Let it never be said of this generation of Americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Much is at stake here, and the nation and the world are watching--to see if we go forward together in the national interest, or if we let partisanship weaken us."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And let there be no mistake about American policy: we will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, why don't we get to work?"
1987,Reagan,Republican,"I am pleased to report that, because of our efforts to rebuild the strength of America, the world is a safer place."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Earlier this month, I submitted a budget to defend America and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says ""yes"" to protecting our country."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"While the world is safer, it is not safe."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Since 1970, the Soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military forces than we have."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Even today, though nearly one in three Soviet families is without running hot water, and the average family spends two hours a day shopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the past five years--clients like Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya, Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Nicaragua."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"With 120,000 Soviet combat and military personnel and 15,000 military advisers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, can anyone still doubt their single-minded determination to expand their power?"
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Despite this, the Congress cut my request for critical U.S. security assistance to free nations by 21 percent this year, and cut defense requests by $85 billion in the last three years."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"These assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual interests, and when the programs are devastated, American interests are harmed."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"My friends, it's my duty as President to say to you again tonight that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Today, the brave people of Afghanistan are showing that resolve."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The Soviet Union says it wants a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan, yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all Soviet troops and genuine self-determination for the Afghan people.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"In Central America, too, the cause of freedom is being tested."
1987,Reagan,Republican,And our resolve is being tested there as well.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Here, especially, the world is watching to see how this Nation responds."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Today, over 90 percent of the people of Latin America live in democracy."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Democracy is on the march in Central and South America.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Communist Nicaragua is the odd man out--suppressing the Church, the press, and democratic dissent and promoting subversion in the region."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the Sandinistas win their war against the Nicaraguan people."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Our commitment to a Western Hemisphere safe from aggression did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office.
1987,Reagan,Republican,It began with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan American policy.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Franklin Roosevelt said we ""are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere."" President Truman was very blunt: ""International communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the Americans."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We cannot let that happen here."" And John F."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Kennedy made clear that ""Communist domination in this hemisphere can never be neqotiated."" Some in this Congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment, but I will not."
1987,Reagan,Republican,This year we celebrate the second century of our Constitution.
1987,Reagan,Republican,The Sandinistas just signed theirs two weeks ago -and then suspended it.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We won't know how my words tonight will be reported there, for one simple reason: there is no free press in Nicaragua."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Nicaraguan freedom fighters have never asked us to wage their battle, but I will fight and effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without freedom."
1987,Reagan,Republican,There must be no Soviet beachhead in Central America.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"You know, we Americans have always preferred dialogue to conflict, and so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the Soviet Union."
1987,Reagan,Republican,But more responsible Soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the U.S.-Soviet agenda.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Progress is also required on the other items of our agenda as well real respect for human rights, and more open contacts between our societies, and, of course, arms reduction."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"In Iceland last October, we had one moment of opportunity that the Soviets dashed because they sought to cripple our Strategic Defense Initiative--SDI."
1987,Reagan,Republican,I wouldn't let them do it then.
1987,Reagan,Republican,I won't let them do it now or in the future.
1987,Reagan,Republican,This is the most positive and promising defense program we have undertaken.
1987,Reagan,Republican,It's the path for both sides--to a safer future; a system that defends human life instead of threatening it.
1987,Reagan,Republican,SDI will go forward.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The United States has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the Soviet Union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But I will need, and American negotiators in Geneva will need Congress' support."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Enacting the Soviet negotiating position into American law would not be the way to win a good agreement.
1987,Reagan,Republican,So I must tell you in this Congress I will veto any effort that undercuts our national security and our negotiating leverage.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now, today, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerce across the world."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We will work to expand our opportunities in international markets through the Uruquay round of trade negotiations and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world's two largest trading partners--Canada and the United States.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Our basic trade policy remains the same: we remain opposed as ever to protectionism because America's growth and future depend on trade.
1987,Reagan,Republican,But we would insist on trade that is fair and free.
1987,Reagan,Republican,We are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now from foreign borders, let us return to our own because America in the world is only as strong as America at home."
1987,Reagan,Republican,This 100th Congress has high responsibilities.
1987,Reagan,Republican,I begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past.
1987,Reagan,Republican,The American people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We've had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we've rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the Depression."
1987,Reagan,Republican,But there's more to do.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"For starters, the federal deficit is outrageous."
1987,Reagan,Republican,For years I've asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of our government.
1987,Reagan,Republican,And what the Congress finally needs to do is pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget--and forces government to live within its means.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"States, cities, and the families of America balance their budgets."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Why can't we?
1987,Reagan,Republican,Next--the budget process is a sorry spectacle.
1987,Reagan,Republican,The missing of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We ask the Congress, once again: Give us the same tool that 43 Governors have--a line-item veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork--those items that would never survive on their own."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"I will send the Congress broad recommendations on the budget, but first I'd like to see yours."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Let's go to work and get this done together.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But now, let's talk about this year's budget."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Even though I have submitted it within the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction target, I have seen suggestions that we might postpone that timetable."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I think the American people are tired of hearing the same old excuses."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Together, we made a commitment to balance the budget: now, let's keep it."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"As for those suggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the American people have repeatedly rejected that shopworn advice."
1987,Reagan,Republican,They know that we don't have deficits because people are taxed too little; we have deficits because big government spends too much.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now, next month, next month, I'll place two additional reforms before the Congress."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We've created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Our national welfare system consists of some 59 major programs and over 6,000 pages of federal laws and regulations on which more than $132 billion was spent in 1985."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"I will propose a new national welfare strategy--a program of welfare reform through state-sponsored, community-based demonstration projects."
1987,Reagan,Republican,This is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare and made self-supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipients want more than anything else."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Next, let us remove a financial specter facing our older Americans--the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death."
1987,Reagan,Republican,I will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now, let's turn to the future."
1987,Reagan,Republican,It's widely said that America is losing her competitive edge.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, that won't happen if we act now."
1987,Reagan,Republican,How well prepared are we to enter the 21st century?
1987,Reagan,Republican,"In my lifetime, America set the standard for the world."
1987,Reagan,Republican,It is now time to determine that we should enter the next century having achieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We will achieve this first, by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote America's ability to compete."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Second, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Rather, it involves an expenditure of American spirit and just plain American grit."
1987,Reagan,Republican,The Congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness--including new science and technology centers and strong new funding for basic research.
1987,Reagan,Republican,The bill will include legal and regulatory reforms and weapons to fight unfair trade practices.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We need to set for them new and more rigorous goals.
1987,Reagan,Republican,We must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Our children should master the basic concepts of math and science, and let's insist that students not leave high school until they have studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage."
1987,Reagan,Republican,There's one more thing we can't let up on.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Let's redouble our personal efforts to provide for every child a safe and drug-free learning environment.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"If our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, we will defeat that scourge all over the country."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Finally, let's stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Our nation could not have been conceived without divine help.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers but we can't use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer?
1987,Reagan,Republican,The 100th Congress of the United States should be remembered as the one that ended the expulsion of God from America's classrooms.
1987,Reagan,Republican,The quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"More than 20 million new jobs will be created before the new century unfolds, and, by then, our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We must also enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace, and I will propose substantial new federal commitments keyed to re-training and Job mobility."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Over the next few weeks, I will be sending the Congress a complete series of these special messages--on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness, including education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture, and other subjects."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The Congress can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just being our best, and that is the core of American greatness."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The responsibility of freedom presses us towards higher knowledge and, I believe, moral and spiritual greatness."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of freeing people's spirits."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"But only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar against our own individual standards."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Excellence is what makes freedom ring.
1987,Reagan,Republican,And isn't that what we do best?
1987,Reagan,Republican,"We're entering our third century now, but it's wrong to judge our nation by its Years."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"The calendar can't measure America because we were meant to be an endless experiment in freedom with no limit to our reaches, no boundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes."
1987,Reagan,Republican,The United States Constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history.
1987,Reagan,Republican,It grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence: that we are here to serve Him by living free--that living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"That we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would secure them not just for ourselves, and for our children, but for all mankind."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Over the years--I won't count if you don't nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to America's young.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And the little ones especially so fresh-faced and so eager to know -well, from time to time I've been with them, they will ask about our Constitution, and I hope you Members of Congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you'll permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening."
1987,Reagan,Republican,I have read the constitutions of a number of countries including the Soviet Union's.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Now some people are surprised to hear that they have a constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Many countries have written into their constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, if this is true, why is the Constitution of the United States so exceptional?"
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you - but it's so great it tells you the whole story in just three words: We the people."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"In those other constitutions, the government tells the people of those countries what they are allowed to do."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"In our Constitution, we the people tell the government what it can do and that it can do only those things listed in that document and no others."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Our revolution is the first to say the people are the masters, and government is their servant."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And you young people out there, don't ever forget that."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Some day, you could be in this room--but wherever you are, America is depending on you to reach your highest and be your best because here, in America, we the people are in charge."
1987,Reagan,Republican,Just three words.
1987,Reagan,Republican,We the people.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Those are the kids on Christmas Day looking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th Parallel in Korea, or aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean."
1987,Reagan,Republican,A million miles from home.
1987,Reagan,Republican,But doing their duty.
1987,Reagan,Republican,We the people.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Those are the warm-hearted whose numbers we can't begin to count who'll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will never know and MIA families they will never meet.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Why?
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Because that's the way we are, this unique breed we call Americans."
1987,Reagan,Republican,We the people.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"They're farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a hungry world."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"They're the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby struggling for life because of a mother who used drugs."
1987,Reagan,Republican,And you'll forgive me a special memory--it's a million mothers like Nelle Reagan who never knew a stranger or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door.
1987,Reagan,Republican,We the people.
1987,Reagan,Republican,They refute last week's television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"They are the entrepreneurs, the builders, the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks the true heroes of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history."
1987,Reagan,Republican,You know they're Americans because their spirit is as big as the universe and their hearts are bigger than their spirits.
1987,Reagan,Republican,We the people.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Starting the third century of a dream and standing up to some cynic who's trying to tell us we're not going to get any better.
1987,Reagan,Republican,Are we at the end?
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I can't tell it any better than the real thing--a story recorded by James Madison from the final moments of the Constitutional Convention--September 17th, 1787."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"As the last few members signed the document, Benjamin Franklin--the oldest delegate at 81 years, and in frail health--looked over toward the chair where George Washington daily presided."
1987,Reagan,Republican,At the back of the chair was painted the picture of a sun on the horizon.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"And turning to those sitting next to him, Franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a rising and a setting sun."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Well, I know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around Franklin--leaning in to listen more closely to him."
1987,Reagan,Republican,And then Dr.
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Franklin began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their efforts, and this is what he said: ""I have often looked at that picture behind the President without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting Sun: But now at length I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting Sun."" Well, you can bet it's rising, because, my fellow citizens, America isn't finished her best days have just begun."
1987,Reagan,Republican,"Thank you, God bless you and God bless America."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 25, 1988 Thank you."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Mr.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"President, and distinguished members of the House and Senate, when we first met here seven years ago--many of us for the first time--it was with the hope or beginning something new for America."
1988,Reagan,Republican,We meet here tonight in this historic Chamber to continue that work.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"If anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, I say let's leave that to history: we're not finished yet."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"So my message to you tonight is, put on your work shoes--we're still on the job."
1988,Reagan,Republican,History records the power of the ideas that brought us here those seven years ago.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Ideas like the individual's right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit, the free market as an engine of economic progress and, as an ancient Chinese philosopher, Lao-tzu, said, ""Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo it."" Well, these ideas were part of a larger notion--a vision, if you will, of America herself--an America not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an America, too, of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods, an America whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values--the value of work, of family, of religion--and of the love of freedom that God places in each of us and whose defense He has entrusted in a special way to this nation."
1988,Reagan,Republican,All of this was made possible by an idea I spoke of when Mr.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Gorbachev was here--the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words: ""We the People""--the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And there is one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which I would offer to you now."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Just as those who created this Republic pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too, America's leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party, but what is best for America."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"In the spirit of Jefferson, let us affirm that, in this Chamber tonight, there are no Republicans, no Democrats, just Americans."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, we will have our differences."
1988,Reagan,Republican,But let us always remember--what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Those who sent us here to serve them--the millions of Americans watching and listening tonight--expect this of us.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Let's prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.
1988,Reagan,Republican,We have done this before.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And as we have worked together to bring down spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; America has created more jobs and better, higher-paying jobs; family income has risen for four straight years, and America's poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history, but an economic and social revolution of hope, based on work, incentives, growth and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77 percent increase in charitable giving; a revolution that--at a critical moment in world history--reclaimed and restored the American dream."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"In international relations, too, there's only one description for what, together, we have achieved--a complete turnabout, a revolution."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Seven years ago, America was weak and freedom everywhere was under siege."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Today America is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"From Central America to East Asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We've replaced ""Blame America"" with ""Look up to America."" We've rebuilt our defenses, and, of all our accomplishments, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our country's uniform."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And in a few moments, I'm going to talk about three development--arms reduction, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the global democratic revolution--that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine seven years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era."
1988,Reagan,Republican,I speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, then, we're strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free."
1988,Reagan,Republican,This is the state of our Union.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And if we will work together this year, I believe we can give a future President and a future Congress the chance to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom, not just the state of our Union, but the state of our world."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Toward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"First, steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Second, let's check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Our third objective tonight is global--continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we've seen around the world.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Fourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next President inherits what you and I have a moral obligation to give that President--a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology, and is fully funded."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Applause.) This is a full agenda.
1988,Reagan,Republican,It's meant to be.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"You see, my thinking on the next year is quite simple--let's make this the best of eight."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And that means--and that means it's all out--right to the finish line.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I don't buy the idea that this is the last year of anything, because we're not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains, but ways of making permanent our successes."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And that's why our focus is the values, the principles, and ideas that made America great."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Let's be clear on this point--we're for limited government because we understand, as the Founding Fathers did, that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every American of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of American prosperity and freedom."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"One other thing we Americans like--the future--like the sound of it, the idea of it, the hope of it."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down; where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, we Americans like the future and like making the most of it."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Let's do that now.
1988,Reagan,Republican,And let's begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of federal deficits.
1988,Reagan,Republican,We have had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"For the first time in 14 years, the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before."
1988,Reagan,Republican,We took $73 billion off last year's deficit compared to the year before.
1988,Reagan,Republican,The deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percent of the Gross National Product to only 3.4 percent.
1988,Reagan,Republican,And perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"You know, a few of us can remember when, not too many years ago, those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because ""we owe it to ourselves."" Well, at last there is agreement that we can't spend ourselves rich."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Our recent budget agreement, designed to reduce federal deficits by $76 billion over the next two years, builds on this consensus."
1988,Reagan,Republican,But this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past--more broken promises and more unchecked spending.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"As I indicated in my first State of the Union, what ails us can be simply put: The federal government is too big and it spends too much money."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I can assure you, the bipartisan leadership of Congress, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And this includes the swift and certain use of the veto power.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Now, it is also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling federal deficits."
1988,Reagan,Republican,The simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenues--something American families do and the federal government can't--has caused crisis after crisis in this city.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Mr.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"President, I will say to you tonight what I have said before--and will continue to say: The budget process has broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"With each ensuing year, the spectacle before the American people is the same as it was this Christmas--budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill--and a federal government on the brink of default."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I know I'm echoing what you here in the Congress have said because you suffered so directly--but let's recall that in seven years, of 91 appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only 10 made it on time."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due by October 1st, none of them made it."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Instead, we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and two days, and three days, respectively."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And then, along came these behemoths."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"This is the conference report--1,053 page report weighing 14 pounds."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Then this--a reconciliation bill six months late, that was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15 pounds; and the long-term continuing resolution--this one was two months late and it's 1,057 pages long, weighing 14 pounds."
1988,Reagan,Republican,That was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"You had three hours--yes, three hours--to consider each, and it took 300 people at my Office of Management and Budget just to read the bill so the government wouldn't shut down."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Let's change all this; instead of a presidential budget that gets discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues?"
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And let's remember our deadline is October 1st, not Christmas; let's get the people's work done in time to avoid a footrace with Santa Claus."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And yes, this year--to coin a phrase--a new beginning."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Thirteen individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by Congress."
1988,Reagan,Republican,I'm also certain you join me in saying: Let's help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the President a tool that--though I will not get use to use it--is one I know future Presidents of either party must have.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Give the President the same authority that 43 governors use in their states, the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and enforce budget discipline."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Let's approve the line-item veto.
1988,Reagan,Republican,And let's take a partial step in this direction.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Most of you in this Chamber didn't know what was in this catch-all bill and report.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Over the past few weeks, we've all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"For example, there's millions for items such as cranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of wild flowers."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And that's not to mention the $5 million (White House correction: $.5 million) or so--that--so that people from developing nations could come here to watch Congress at work.
1988,Reagan,Republican,I won't even touch that.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"So tonight, I offer you this challenge."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"In 30 days, I will send back to you those items as rescissions, which if I had the authority to line them out, I would do so."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Now, review this multibillion-dollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"As a matter of fact, if adopted, it will improve our deficit reduction goals."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And what an example we can set; that we're serious about getting our financial accounts in order.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"By acting and approving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control."
1988,Reagan,Republican,There is another vital reform.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings has been profoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Let us do now what so many states do to hold down spending and what 32 state legislatures have asked us to do; let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of Americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within its means.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Reform of the budget process--including the line-item veto and balanced budget amendment--will, together with real restraint on government spending, prevent the federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Let's ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Last September, I signed an Executive Order on the family requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"But let us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process, not just in this administration but in future--all future administrations."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"It's time for Congress to consider--at the beginning--a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of American society, the family."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And speaking of the family, let's turn to a matter on the mind of every American parent tonight--education."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We all know the sorry story of the 60s and 70s--soaring spending, plummeting test scores--and that hopeful trend of the 80s, when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"There's a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard 100 times--in a child's education, money can never take the place of basics like discipline, hard work, and, yes, homework."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"As a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education--more than we spend on defense--yet across our country, governors like New Jersey's Tom Kean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important as how much we spend."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Opening up the teaching profession to all qualified candidates, merit pay, so that good teachers get A's as well as apples, and stronger curriculum, as Secretary Bennett has proposed for high schools."
1988,Reagan,Republican,These imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular new kid in America's schools.
1988,Reagan,Republican,How can we help?
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Well, we can talk about and push for these reforms."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"But the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the states, local communities and, most of all, to the parents and teachers."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"My friends, some years ago, the federal government declared war on poverty, and poverty won."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Today, the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than $100 billion a year on them."
1988,Reagan,Republican,What has all this money done?
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"With the best of intentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty--the family."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one generation to the next, of too many fragmented families."
1988,Reagan,Republican,It is time--this may be the most radical thing I've said in seven years in this office--it's time for Washington to show a little humility.
1988,Reagan,Republican,There are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 states and a thousand communities around the nation.
1988,Reagan,Republican,It is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights.
1988,Reagan,Republican,States have begun to show us the way.
1988,Reagan,Republican,They have demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Let us give the states even more flexibility and encourage more reforms.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Let's start making our welfare system the first rung on America's ladder of opportunity--a boost up from dependency; not a graveyard, but a birthplace of hope."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life.
1988,Reagan,Republican,The first is an untold American success story.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Recently, we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We can be proud that our students are ""just saying no"" to drugs."
1988,Reagan,Republican,But let us remember what this menace requires--commitment from every part of America and every single American--a commitment to a drug-free America.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"The war against drugs is a war of individual battles, a crusade with many heroes--including America's young people, and also someone very special to me."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"She has helped so many of our young people to say ""no"" to drugs."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Nancy, much credit belongs to you, and I want to express to you your husband's pride and your country's thanks."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Surprised you, didn't I?"
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Well now, we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Tonight, I call America--a good nation, a moral people--to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"To those who say this violates a woman's right to control of her own body--can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?"
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal funding for abortion--and with a human life amendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Our Judeo-Christian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"But with that one exception, let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I pledge to you tonight, I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of Americans, so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And let me add here: so many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation's health and vigor.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"The Congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the Supreme Court, with an acknowledgment of the Supreme Being--yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray."
1988,Reagan,Republican,I believe Congress should pass our school prayer amendment.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Now, to make sure there is a full nine-member Supreme Court to interpret the law, to protect the rights of all Americans, I urge the Senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the highest Court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the federal judiciary."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Here then are our domestic priorities; yet if the Congress and the administration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy; to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutions."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Our policies consistently received the strongest support of the late Congressman Dan Daniel of Virginia.
1988,Reagan,Republican,I'm sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.
1988,Reagan,Republican,One of the greatest contributions the United States can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs."
1988,Reagan,Republican,We should always remember: protectionism is destructionism.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"America's jobs, America's growth, America's future depend on trade--trade that is free, open, and fair."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"This year, we have it within our power to take a major step toward a growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this Earth."
1988,Reagan,Republican,I'm speaking of the historic Free Trade Agreement negotiated between our country and Canada.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And I can also tell you that we're determined to expand this concept, south as well as north."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Next month I will be traveling to Mexico where trade matters will be of foremost concern.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And, over the next several months, our Congress and the Canadian Parliament can make the start of such a North American accord a reality."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade--from the tip of Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle--unites the people of the Western Hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange; when all borders become what the U.S.-Canadian border so long has been--a meeting place, rather than a dividing line."
1988,Reagan,Republican,This movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom--and against totalitarian rule.
1988,Reagan,Republican,This global democratic revolution has removed the specter--so frightening a decade ago--of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"In South and Central America, only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Today, over 90 percent of Latin Americans live in nations committed to democratic principles."
1988,Reagan,Republican,And the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"In Nicaragua, the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"The recent revelations of a former high-level Sandinista major, Roger Miranda, show us that, even as they talk peace, the communist Sandinista government of Nicaragua has established plans for a large 600,000-man army."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Yet even as these plans are made, the Sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of Nicaraguan freedom is riding at its crest."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Because of the freedom fighters, who are resisting communist rule, the Sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights, negotiate with Church authorities, and release a few political prisoners."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"The focus is on the Sandinistas, their promises and their actions."
1988,Reagan,Republican,There is a consensus among the four Central American democratic presidents that the Sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of Central America.
1988,Reagan,Republican,The Sandinistas again have promised reforms.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"On Wednesday, my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace, freedom, and democracy in Nicaragua."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I ask Congress to pass this request--let us be for the people of Nicaragua what Lafayette, Pulaski, and Von Steuben were for our forefathers and the cause of American independence."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"So, too, in Afghanistan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace."
1988,Reagan,Republican,We support the Mujahadeen.
1988,Reagan,Republican,There can be no settlement unless all Soviet troops are removed and the Afghan people are allowed genuine self-determination.
1988,Reagan,Republican,I have made my views on this matter known to Mr.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Gorbachev.
1988,Reagan,Republican,But not just Nicaragua or Afghanistan.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Yes, everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide across the world--freedom fighters rising up in Cambodia and Angola, fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Their cause is our cause.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Freedom.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Yet, even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war."
1988,Reagan,Republican,But let's have no illusions.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Three years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizing earlier hard-won goals."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We must face squarely the implications of this negative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal both this year and in the future."
1988,Reagan,Republican,This same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as well.
1988,Reagan,Republican,But the resolve of America and its NATO allies has opened the way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Our recently signed INF Treaty is historic because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most stringent verification regime in arms control history, including several forms of short-notice, on-site inspection."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"I submitted the treaty today, and I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Thank you very much.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"In addition to the INF Treaty, we're within reach of an even more significant START agreement that will reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range missile or strategic arsenals by half."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"But let me be clear--our approach is not to seek agreement for agreement's sake, but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies."
1988,Reagan,Republican,We will never put our security at risk--or that of our allies--just to reach an agreement with the Soviets.
1988,Reagan,Republican,No agreement is better than a bad agreement.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"As I mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what we never had--a future free of nuclear terror."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Reduction of strategic offensive arms is one step.
1988,Reagan,Republican,SDI another.
1988,Reagan,Republican,Our funding request for our Strategic Defense Initiative is less than two percent of the total defense budget.
1988,Reagan,Republican,SDI funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent.
1988,Reagan,Republican,SDI has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction.
1988,Reagan,Republican,It reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, more stable basis for deterrence."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We must also remember that SDI is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident--a Chernobyl of the sky--or an accidental launch, or some madman who might come along."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We've seen such changes in the world in seven years--as totalitarianism struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"As the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism on the defensive, we have left behind the days of retreat--America is again a vigorous leader of the free world, a nation that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"No legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of American power from ever occurring again."
1988,Reagan,Republican,But my thoughts tonight go beyond this.
1988,Reagan,Republican,And I hope you'll let me end this evening with a personal reflection.
1988,Reagan,Republican,"You know, the world could never be quite the same again after Jacob Shallus, a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, took his pen and engrossed those words about representative government in the Preamble of our Constitution."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"And in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was forever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the Emmitsburg Pike in an obscure Pennsylvania town called Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke of our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the Earth."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"At the start of this decade, I suggested that we lived in equally momentous times--that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a quiet, pleasant, greening land called America."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"Not everything has been made perfect in seven years--nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years--but before us, this year and beyond, are great prospects for the cause of peace and world freedom."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"It means, too, that the young Americans I spoke of seven years ago, as well as those who might be coming along the Virginia or Maryland shores this night and seeing for the first time the lights of this capital city, the lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to the memory of our great men--it means those young Americans will find a city of hope in a land that is free."
1988,Reagan,Republican,"We can be proud that for them and for us as those lights along the Potomac are still seen this night--signaling, as they have for nearly two centuries and as we pray God they always will, that another generation of Americans has protected and passed on lovingly this place called America, this shining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people."
1988,Reagan,Republican,Thank you and God bless you.
1989,Bush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W.
1989,Bush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS ON ADMINISTRATION GOALS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS February 9, 1989 Mr."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
1989,Bush,Republican,"President, and distinguished Members of the House and Senate, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Less than 3 weeks ago, I joined you on the West Front of this very building and, looking over the monuments to our proud past, offered you my hand in filling the next page of American history with a story of extended prosperity and continued peace."
1989,Bush,Republican,And tonight I'm back to offer you my plans as well.
1989,Bush,Republican,The hand remains extended; the sleeves are rolled up; America is waiting; and now we must produce.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Together, we can build a better America."
1989,Bush,Republican,It is comforting to return to this historic Chamber.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Here, 22 years ago, I first raised my hand to be sworn into public life."
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, tonight I feel as if I'm returning home to friends."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And I intend, in the months and years to come, to give you what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgment about ways to improve America's future."
1989,Bush,Republican,"In return, I ask for an honest commitment to our common mission of progress."
1989,Bush,Republican,"If we seize the opportunities on the road before us, there'll be praise enough for all."
1989,Bush,Republican,"The people didn't send us here to bicker, and it's time to govern."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And many Presidents have come to this Chamber in times of great crisis: war and depression, loss of national spirit."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And 8 years ago, I sat in that very chair as President Reagan spoke of punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates and people out of work -- American confidence on the wane."
1989,Bush,Republican,And our challenge is different.
1989,Bush,Republican,We're fortunate -- a much changed landscape lies before us tonight.
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, I don't propose to reverse direction."
1989,Bush,Republican,"We're headed the right way, but we cannot rest."
1989,Bush,Republican,We're a people whose energy and drive have fueled our rise to greatness.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And we're a forward-looking nation -- generous, yes, but ambitious, not for ourselves but for the world."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Complacency is not in our character -- not before, not now, not ever."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And so, tonight we must take a strong America and make it even better."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must address some very real problems.
1989,Bush,Republican,We must establish some very clear priorities.
1989,Bush,Republican,And we must make a very substantial cut in the Federal budget deficit.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Some people find that agenda impossible, but I'm presenting to you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it."
1989,Bush,Republican,"My plan has four broad features: attention to urgent priorities, investment in the future, an attack on the deficit, and no new taxes."
1989,Bush,Republican,This budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our priorities.
1989,Bush,Republican,There are many areas in which we would all like to spend more than I propose; I understand that.
1989,Bush,Republican,But we cannot until we get our fiscal house in order.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Next year alone, thanks to economic growth, without any change in the law, the Federal Government will take in over $80 billion more than it does this year."
1989,Bush,Republican,"That's right -- over $80 billion in new revenues, with no increases in taxes."
1989,Bush,Republican,And our job is to allocate those new resources wisely.
1989,Bush,Republican,"We can afford to increase spending by a modest amount, but enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in 1 year."
1989,Bush,Republican,And that will allow us to meet the targets set forth in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
1989,Bush,Republican,"But to do that, we must recognize that growth above inflation in Federal programs is not preordained, that not all spending initiatives were designed to be immortal."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I make this pledge tonight: My team and I are ready to work with the Congress, to form a special leadership group, to negotiate in good faith, to work day and night -- if that's what it takes -- to meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time."
1989,Bush,Republican,We cannot settle for business as usual.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Government by continuing resolution, or government by crisis, will not do."
1989,Bush,Republican,And I ask the Congress tonight to approve several measures which will make budgeting more sensible.
1989,Bush,Republican,We could save time and improve efficiency by enacting 2-year budgets.
1989,Bush,Republican,Forty-three Governors have the line-item veto.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Presidents should have it, too."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And at the very least, when a President proposes to rescind Federal spending, the Congress should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by inaction."
1989,Bush,Republican,And I ask the Congress to honor the public's wishes by passing a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Such an amendment, once phased in, will discipline both the Congress and the executive branch."
1989,Bush,Republican,Several principles describe the kind of America I hope to build with your help in the years ahead.
1989,Bush,Republican,"We will not have the luxury of taking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher taxes put economic growth at risk."
1989,Bush,Republican,Economic growth provides jobs and hope.
1989,Bush,Republican,Economic growth enables us to pay for social programs.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Economic growth enhances the security of the Nation, and low tax rates create economic growth."
1989,Bush,Republican,I believe in giving Americans greater freedom and greater choice.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And I will work for choice for American families, whether in the housing in which they live, the schools to which they send their children, or the child care they select for their young."
1989,Bush,Republican,"You see, I believe that we have an obligation to those in need, but that government should not be the provider of first resort for things that the private sector can produce better."
1989,Bush,Republican,I believe in a society that is free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind.
1989,Bush,Republican,And I will work to knock down the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barriers from ever being built again.
1989,Bush,Republican,I believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the Nation.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And I'll work to make them strong, for as Benjamin Franklin said: ""If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, can a great nation rise without His aid?"" And I believe in giving people the power to make their own lives better through growth and opportunity."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And together, let's put power in the hands of people."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Three weeks ago, we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural, the 200th anniversary of the first Presidency."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And if you look back, one thing is so striking about the way the Founding Fathers looked at America."
1989,Bush,Republican,They didn't talk about themselves.
1989,Bush,Republican,They talked about posterity.
1989,Bush,Republican,They talked about the future.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And we, too, must think in terms bigger than ourselves."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow.
1989,Bush,Republican,"We must extend American leadership in technology, increase long-term investment, improve our educational system, and boost productivity."
1989,Bush,Republican,"These are the keys to building a better future, and here are some of my recommendations: I propose almost $2.2 billion for the National Science Foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double its budget by 1993."
1989,Bush,Republican,I propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development.
1989,Bush,Republican,I've asked Vice President Quayle to chair a new Task Force on Competitiveness.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And I request funding for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and a strong space program, an increase of almost $2.4 billion over the current fiscal year."
1989,Bush,Republican,"We must have a manned space station; a vigorous, safe space shuttle program; and more commercial development in space."
1989,Bush,Republican,"The space program should always go ""full throttle up."" And that's not just our ambition; it's our destiny."
1989,Bush,Republican,I propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase long-term investment.
1989,Bush,Republican,"History on this is clear -- this will increase revenues, help savings, and create new jobs."
1989,Bush,Republican,We won't be competitive if we leave whole sectors of America behind.
1989,Bush,Republican,This is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise zones and bring hope to the inner cities.
1989,Bush,Republican,But the most important competitiveness program of all is one which improves education in America.
1989,Bush,Republican,"When some of our students actually have trouble locating America on a map of the world, it is time for us to map a new approach to education."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy.
1989,Bush,Republican,We must help schools that need help the most.
1989,Bush,Republican,"We must give choice to parents, students, teachers, and principals; and we must hold all concerned accountable."
1989,Bush,Republican,"In education, we cannot tolerate mediocrity."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I want to cut that dropout rate and make America a more literate nation, because what it really comes down to is this: The longer our graduation lines are today, the shorter our unemployment lines will be tomorrow."
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, tonight I'm proposing the following initiatives: the beginning of a $500 million program to reward America's best schools, merit schools; the creation of special Presidential awards for the best teachers in every State, because excellence should be rewarded; the establishment of a new program of National Science Scholars, one each year for every Member of the House and Senate, to give this generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and mathematics; the expanded use of magnet schools, which give families and students greater choice; and a new program to encourage alternative certification, which will let talented people from all fields teach in our classrooms."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I've said I'd like to be the ""Education President."" And tonight, I'd ask you to join me by becoming the ""Education Congress."" Just last week, as I settled into this new office, I received a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania who had been struck by my message in the Inaugural Address. ""Not 12 hours before,"" she wrote, ""my husband and I received word that our son was addicted to cocaine."
1989,Bush,Republican,He had the world at his feet.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Bright, gifted, personable -- he could have done anything with his life."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And now he has chosen cocaine."" ""And please,"" she wrote, ""find a way to curb the supply of cocaine."
1989,Bush,Republican,Get tough with the pushers.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Our son needs your help."" My friends, that voice crying out for help could be the voice of your own neighbor, your own friend, your own son."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Over 23 million Americans used illegal drugs last year, at a staggering cost to our nation's well-being."
1989,Bush,Republican,Let this be recorded as the time when America rose up and said no to drugs.
1989,Bush,Republican,The scourge of drugs must be stopped.
1989,Bush,Republican,And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs.
1989,Bush,Republican,The war must be waged on all fronts.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Our new drug czar, Bill Bennett, and I will be shoulder to shoulder in the executive branch leading the charge."
1989,Bush,Republican,Some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor and to young mothers.
1989,Bush,Republican,"This will offer the helping hand to the many innocent victims of drugs, like the thousands of babies born addicted or with AIDS because of the mother's addiction."
1989,Bush,Republican,Some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment.
1989,Bush,Republican,Some money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is now the worst.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And much of it will be used to protect our borders, with help from the Coast Guard and the Customs Service, the Departments of State and Justice, and, yes, the U.S. military."
1989,Bush,Republican,I mean to get tough on the drug criminals.
1989,Bush,Republican,And let me be clear: This President will back up those who put their lives on the line every single day -- our local police officers.
1989,Bush,Republican,"My budget asks for beefed-up prosecution, for a new attack on organized crime, and for enforcement of tough sentences -- and for the worst kingpins, that means the death penalty."
1989,Bush,Republican,I also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted there's a cell waiting for him.
1989,Bush,Republican,And he should not go free because prisons are too full.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And so, let the word go out: If you're caught and convicted, you will do time."
1989,Bush,Republican,"But for all we do in law enforcement, in interdiction and treatment, we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop the demand for drugs."
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, some of this increase will be used to educate the young about the dangers of drugs."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must involve the parents.
1989,Bush,Republican,We must involve the teachers.
1989,Bush,Republican,We must involve the communities.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And, my friends, we must involve ourselves, each and every one of us in this concern."
1989,Bush,Republican,"One problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and our continuing compassion, and that is the terrible tragedy of AIDS."
1989,Bush,Republican,I'm asking for $1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease and for research to find a cure.
1989,Bush,Republican,"If we're to protect our future, we need a new attitude about the environment."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must protect the air we breathe.
1989,Bush,Republican,"I will send to you shortly legislation for a new, more effective Clean Air Act."
1989,Bush,Republican,"It will include a plan to reduce by date certain the emissions which cause acid rain, because the time for study alone has passed, and the time for action is now."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must make use of clean coal.
1989,Bush,Republican,"My budget contains full funding, on schedule, for the clean coal technology agreement that we've made with Canada."
1989,Bush,Republican,"We've made that agreement with Canada, and we intend to honor that agreement."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must not neglect our parks.
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, I'm asking to fund new acquisitions under the Land and Water Conservation Fund."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must protect our oceans.
1989,Bush,Republican,And I support new penalties against those who would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans.
1989,Bush,Republican,The age of the needle on the beaches must end.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And in some cases, the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And when those with the most promise can be tapped safely, as with much of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, we should proceed."
1989,Bush,Republican,But we must use caution; we must respect the environment.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And so, tonight I'm calling for the indefinite postponement of three lease sales which have raised troubling questions, two off the coast of California and one which could threaten the Everglades in Florida."
1989,Bush,Republican,Action on these three lease sales will await the conclusion of a special task force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage.
1989,Bush,Republican,I'm directing the Attorney General and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic-waste dumpers.
1989,Bush,Republican,I want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties against polluters.
1989,Bush,Republican,"In addition to caring for our future, we must care for those around us."
1989,Bush,Republican,"A decent society shows compassion for the young, the elderly, the vulnerable, and the poor."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Our first obligation is to the most vulnerable -- infants, poor mothers, children living in poverty -- and my proposed budget recognizes this."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I ask for full funding of Medicaid, an increase of over $3 billion, and an expansion of the program to include coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line."
1989,Bush,Republican,I believe we should help working families cope with the burden of child care.
1989,Bush,Republican,Our help should be aimed at those who need it most: low-income families with young children.
1989,Bush,Republican,"I support a new child care tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families, without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Now, I know there are competing proposals."
1989,Bush,Republican,But remember this: The overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by relatives and neighbors and churches and community groups.
1989,Bush,Republican,Families who choose these options should remain eligible for help.
1989,Bush,Republican,Parents should have choice.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And for those children who are unwanted or abused or whose parents are deceased, we should encourage adoption."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and to double it to $3,000."
1989,Bush,Republican,Let's make it easier for these kids to have parents who love them.
1989,Bush,Republican,We have a moral contract with our senior citizens.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And in this budget, Social Security is fully funded, including a full cost-of-living adjustment."
1989,Bush,Republican,We must honor our contract.
1989,Bush,Republican,"We must care about those in the shadow of life, and I, like many Americans, am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless."
1989,Bush,Republican,The causes of homelessness are many; the history is long.
1989,Bush,Republican,But the moral imperative to act is clear.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land, many organizations already contribute, but we in government cannot stand on the sidelines."
1989,Bush,Republican,"In my budget, I ask for greater support for emergency food and shelter, for health services and measures to prevent substance abuse, and for clinics for the mentally ill."
1989,Bush,Republican,And I propose a new initiative involving the full range of government agencies.
1989,Bush,Republican,We must confront this national shame.
1989,Bush,Republican,There's another issue that I've decided to mention here tonight.
1989,Bush,Republican,I've long believed that the people of Puerto Rico should have the right to determine their own political future.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Personally, I strongly favor statehood."
1989,Bush,Republican,But I urge the Congress to take the necessary steps to allow the people to decide in a referendum.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Certain problems, the result of decades of unwise practices, threaten the health and security of our people."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Left unattended, they will only get worse."
1989,Bush,Republican,But we can act now to put them behind us.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Earlier this week, I announced my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our savings system."
1989,Bush,Republican,I ask Congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days.
1989,Bush,Republican,We must not let this situation fester.
1989,Bush,Republican,We owe it to the savers in this country to solve this problem.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Certainly, the savings of Americans must remain secure."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Let me be clear: Insured depositors will continue to be fully protected, but any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform."
1989,Bush,Republican,Our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring.
1989,Bush,Republican,The best answer is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again.
1989,Bush,Republican,The majority of thrifts in communities across the Nation have been honest.
1989,Bush,Republican,They've played a major role in helping families achieve the dream of home ownership.
1989,Bush,Republican,"But make no mistake, those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out of the business; and they should go to jail."
1989,Bush,Republican,We face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades of environmental neglect at America's nuclear weapons plants.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Clearly, we must modernize these plants and operate them safely."
1989,Bush,Republican,That's not at issue; our national security depends on it.
1989,Bush,Republican,"But beyond that, we must clean up the old mess that's been left behind."
1989,Bush,Republican,And I propose in this budget to more than double our current effort to do so.
1989,Bush,Republican,"This will allow us to identify the exact nature of the various problems so we can clean them up, and clean them up we will."
1989,Bush,Republican,We've been fortunate during these past 8 years.
1989,Bush,Republican,America is a stronger nation than it was in 1980.
1989,Bush,Republican,Morale in our Armed Forces has been restored; our resolve has been shown.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Our readiness has been improved, and we are at peace."
1989,Bush,Republican,There can no longer be any doubt that peace has been made more secure through strength.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And when America is stronger, the world is safer."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Most people don't realize that after the successful restoration of our strength, the Pentagon budget has actually been reduced in real terms for each of the last 4 years."
1989,Bush,Republican,We cannot tolerate continued real reduction in defense.
1989,Bush,Republican,"In light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit, however, I support a 1-year freeze in the military budget, something I proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And this freeze will apply for only 1 year, and after that, increases above inflation will be required."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I will not sacrifice American preparedness, and I will not compromise American strength."
1989,Bush,Republican,I should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation for the coming year: The savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing in our future that I've spoken about tonight.
1989,Bush,Republican,This defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meets the targets spelled out in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law without raising taxes and which incorporates reforms in the budget process.
1989,Bush,Republican,I've directed the National Security Council to review our national security and defense policies and report back to me within 90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies.
1989,Bush,Republican,"I'm also charging the Department of Defense with the task of developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and management of the Pentagon, one which will fully implement the Packard commission report."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Many of these changes can only be made with the participation of the Congress, and so, I ask for your help."
1989,Bush,Republican,We need fewer regulations.
1989,Bush,Republican,We need less bureaucracy.
1989,Bush,Republican,We need multiyear procurement and 2-year budgeting.
1989,Bush,Republican,And frankly -- and don't take this wrong -- we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation's military policy.
1989,Bush,Republican,"I detect a slight division on that question, but nevertheless -- [laughter]."
1989,Bush,Republican,Securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the most important priority I'd like to address tonight.
1989,Bush,Republican,"You know, we meet at a time of extraordinary hope."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Never before in this century have our values of freedom, democracy, and economic opportunity been such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Never before has our leadership been so crucial, because while America has its eyes on the future, the world has its eyes on America."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And it's a time of great change in the world, and especially in the Soviet Union."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full meaning of the change going on there, review our policies, and then proceed with caution."
1989,Bush,Republican,But I've personally assured General Secretary Gorbachev that at the conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward.
1989,Bush,Republican,We will not miss any opportunity to work for peace.
1989,Bush,Republican,The fundamental facts remain that the Soviets retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are still too often in conflict with ours.
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, let us take the new openness seriously, but let's also be realistic."
1989,Bush,Republican,And let's always be strong.
1989,Bush,Republican,There are some pressing issues we must address.
1989,Bush,Republican,I will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative.
1989,Bush,Republican,"The spread, and even use, of sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the Earth, never to be used again."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And look, this won't be easy."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Verification -- extraordinarily difficult, but civilization and human decency demand that we try."
1989,Bush,Republican,And the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped.
1989,Bush,Republican,And I'll work to strengthen the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
1989,Bush,Republican,Our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And around the globe, we must continue to be freedom's best friend."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And we must stand firm for self-determination and democracy in Central America, including in Nicaragua."
1989,Bush,Republican,"It is my strongly held conviction that when people are given the chance they inevitably will choose a free press, freedom of worship, and certifiably free and fair elections."
1989,Bush,Republican,"We must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracies, as solid a force for peace as the world has ever known."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And this is an alliance forged by the power of our ideals, not the pettiness of our differences."
1989,Bush,Republican,"So, let's lift our sights to rise above fighting about beef hormones, to building a better future, to move from protectionism to progress."
1989,Bush,Republican,"I've asked the Secretary of State to visit Europe next week and to consult with our allies on the wide range of challenges and opportunities we face together, including East-West relations."
1989,Bush,Republican,And I look forward to meeting with our NATO partners in the near future.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And I, too, shall begin a trip shortly to the far reaches of the Pacific Basin, where the winds of democracy are creating new hope and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force."
1989,Bush,Republican,"When I served as our representative in China 14 or 15 years ago, few would have predicted the scope of the changes we've witnessed since then."
1989,Bush,Republican,"But in preparing for this trip, I was struck by something I came across from a Chinese writer."
1989,Bush,Republican,"He was speaking of his country, decades ago, but his words speak to each of us in America tonight. ""Today,"" he said, ""we're afraid of the simple words like `goodness' and `mercy' and `kindness.""' My friends, if we're to succeed as a nation, we must rediscover those words."
1989,Bush,Republican,"In just 3 days, we mark the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, the man who saved our Union and gave new meaning to the word ""opportunity."" Lincoln once said: ""I hold that while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorating that of mankind."" It is this broader mission to which I call all Americans, because the definition of a successful life must include serving others."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And to the young people of America, who sometimes feel left out, I ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program called YES, for Youth Entering Service to America."
1989,Bush,Republican,"To those men and women in business, remember the ultimate end of your work: to make a better product, to create better lives."
1989,Bush,Republican,I ask you to plan for the longer term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profits.
1989,Bush,Republican,"To the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United States of America, thank you."
1989,Bush,Republican,Your calling is a high one: to be the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty.
1989,Bush,Republican,And I want you to know that this nation is grateful for your service.
1989,Bush,Republican,"To the farmers of America, we appreciate the bounty you provide."
1989,Bush,Republican,We will work with you to open foreign markets to American agricultural products.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And to the parents of America, I ask you to get involved in your child's schooling."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Check on the homework, go to the school, meet the teachers, care about what is happening there."
1989,Bush,Republican,"It's not only your child's future on the line, it's America's."
1989,Bush,Republican,"To kids in our cities, don't give up hope."
1989,Bush,Republican,Say no to drugs; stay in school.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And, yes, ""Keep hope alive."" To those 37 million Americans with some form of disability, you belong in the economic mainstream."
1989,Bush,Republican,We need your talents in America's work force.
1989,Bush,Republican,Disabled Americans must become full partners in America's opportunity society.
1989,Bush,Republican,"To the families of America watching tonight in your living rooms, hold fast to your dreams because ultimately America's future rests in your hands."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And to my friends in this Chamber, I ask your cooperation to keep America growing while cutting the deficit."
1989,Bush,Republican,That's only fair to those who now have no vote: the generations to come.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Let them look back and say that we had the foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to rest but a time to press forward, a time to invest in the future."
1989,Bush,Republican,"And let all Americans remember that no problem of human making is too great to be overcome by human ingenuity, human energy, and the untiring hope of the human spirit."
1989,Bush,Republican,I believe this.
1989,Bush,Republican,I would not have asked to be your President if I didn't.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And tomorrow the debate on the plan I've put forward begins, and I ask the Congress to come forward with your own proposals."
1989,Bush,Republican,Let's not question each other's motives.
1989,Bush,Republican,"Let's debate, let's negotiate; but let us solve the problem."
1989,Bush,Republican,Recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches -- [laughter] -- but tonight is one of some note.
1989,Bush,Republican,"On February 9th, 1941, just 48 years ago tonight, Sir Winston Churchill took to the airwaves during Britain's hour of peril."
1989,Bush,Republican,"He'd received from President Roosevelt a hand-carried letter quoting Longfellow's famous poem: ""Sail on, O Ship of State!"
1989,Bush,Republican,"Sail on, O Union, strong and great!"
1989,Bush,Republican,"Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate!"" And Churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war, but he directed his words to Franklin Roosevelt. ""We shall not fail or falter,"" he said. ""We shall not weaken or tire."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Give us the tools, and we will finish the job."" Tonight, almost half a century later, our peril may be less immediate, but the need for perseverance and clear-sighted fortitude is just as great."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Now, as then, there are those who say it can't be done."
1989,Bush,Republican,"There are voices who say that America's best days have passed, that we're bound by constraints, threatened by problems, surrounded by troubles which limit our ability to hope."
1989,Bush,Republican,"Well, tonight I remain full of hope."
1989,Bush,Republican,We Americans have only begun on our mission of goodness and greatness.
1989,Bush,Republican,"And to those timid souls, I repeat the plea: ""Give us the tools, and we will do the job."" Thank you."
1989,Bush,Republican,"God bless you, and God bless America."
1990,Bush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W.
1990,Bush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 31, 1990 Mr."
1990,Bush,Republican,"President, Mr."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Speaker, Members of the United States Congress: I return as a former President of the Senate and a former Member of this great House."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And now, as President, it is my privilege to report to you on the state of the Union."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Tonight I come not to speak about the state of the Government, not to detail every new initiative we plan for the coming year nor to describe every line in the budget."
1990,Bush,Republican,"I'm here to speak to you and to the American people about the state of the Union, about our world -- the changes we've seen, the challenges we face -- and what that means for America."
1990,Bush,Republican,"There are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes before from all that comes after."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And many of us in this Chamber have lived much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in 1945; and the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of progress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Nineteen forty-five provided the common frame of reference, the compass points of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And that was our world, until now."
1990,Bush,Republican,"The events of the year just ended, the Revolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs."
1990,Bush,Republican,Think back -- think back just 12 short months ago to the world we knew as 1989 began.
1990,Bush,Republican,"One year -- one year ago, the people of Panama lived in fear, under the thumb of a dictator."
1990,Bush,Republican,Today democracy is restored; Panama is free.
1990,Bush,Republican,Operation Just Cause has achieved its objective.
1990,Bush,Republican,The number of military personnel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the operation began.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And tonight I am announcing that well before the end of February, the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who made this mission a success, will be back home."
1990,Bush,Republican,"A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared that he was ready to open a dialog with the Communist rulers of that country; and today, with the future of a free Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish Government."
1990,Bush,Republican,"A year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a prisoner in Prague."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of Czechoslovakia."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And 1 year ago, Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his guide, and he predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And today, less than 1 year later, it's the Wall that's history."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Remarkable events -- events that fulfill the long-held hopes of the American people; events that validate the longstanding goals of American policy, a policy based on a single, shining principle: the cause of freedom."
1990,Bush,Republican,"America, not just the nation but an idea, alive in the minds of people everywhere."
1990,Bush,Republican,"As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom -- today, tomorrow, and into the next century."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on these shores, and the millions still struggling to be free."
1990,Bush,Republican,"This nation, this idea called America, was and always will be a new world -- our new world."
1990,Bush,Republican,"At a workers' rally, in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague, the idea called America is alive."
1990,Bush,Republican,"A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to speak at the factory gates."
1990,Bush,Republican,"He begins his speech to his fellow citizens with these words, words of a distant revolution: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'' It's no secret that here at home freedom's door opened long ago."
1990,Bush,Republican,"The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private investment, stewardship, and of course leadership."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system second to none, and make it better: a better America, where there's a job for everyone who wants one; where women working outside the home can be confident their children are in safe and loving care and where government works to expand child-care alternatives for parents; where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy; where ``Made in the USA'' is recognized around the world as the symbol of quality and progress; where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work, and to contribute to society and where, for the first time, the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens; where everyone has a roof over his head and where the homeless get the help they need to live in dignity; where our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers and where all of them make the grade; where every street, every city, every school, and every child is drug-free; and finally, where no American is forgotten -- our hearts go out to our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and in our efforts."
1990,Bush,Republican,"That's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make for ourselves, but dreams alone won't get us there."
1990,Bush,Republican,"We need to extend our horizon, commit to the long view."
1990,Bush,Republican,And our mission for the future starts today.
1990,Bush,Republican,"In the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great challenges and great opportunities."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And we know that we can succeed in the global economic arena of the nineties, but to meet that challenge, we must make some fundamental changes -- some crucial investment in ourselves."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Yes, we are going to invest in America."
1990,Bush,Republican,"This administration is determined to encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds: physical capital -- everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods and quality services; intellectual capital -- the source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products; and of course our human capital -- the talented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of American ingenuity, the spirit that is the hallmark of the American worker, that would be bad."
1990,Bush,Republican,The American worker is the most productive worker in the world.
1990,Bush,Republican,We need to save more.
1990,Bush,Republican,We need to expand the pool of capital for new investments that need more jobs and more growth.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And that's the idea behind a new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to Congress tomorrow."
1990,Bush,Republican,"We need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage risktakers, especially those in our small businesses, to take those steps that translate into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us."
1990,Bush,Republican,We'll do what it takes to invest in America's future.
1990,Bush,Republican,The budget commitment is there.
1990,Bush,Republican,The money is there.
1990,Bush,Republican,"It's there for research and development, R&D -- a record high."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's there for our housing initiative -- HOPE -- to help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless.
1990,Bush,Republican,The money's there to keep our kids drug-free -- 70 percent more than when I took office in 1989.
1990,Bush,Republican,It's there for space exploration.
1990,Bush,Republican,And it's there for education -- another record high.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And one more thing: Last fall at the education summit, the Governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are ready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom."
1990,Bush,Republican,And I've made good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds -- an extra half-a-billion dollars -- for something near and dear to all of us: Head Start.
1990,Bush,Republican,Education is the one investment that means more for our future because it means the most for our children.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of spending more: It's a matter of asking more -- expecting more -- of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents, and ourselves."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And that's why tonight I am announcing America's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from the Nation's Governors."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And if I might, I'd like to say I'm very pleased that Governor Gardner [Washington] and Governor Clinton [Arkansas], Governor Branstad [Iowa], Governor Campbell [South Carolina], all of whom were very key in these discussions, these deliberations, are with us here tonight."
1990,Bush,Republican,"By the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn."
1990,Bush,Republican,The United States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than 90 percent.
1990,Bush,Republican,And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean something.
1990,Bush,Republican,"In critical subjects -- at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades -- we must assess our students' performance."
1990,Bush,Republican,"By the year 2000, U.S. students must be first in the world in math and science achievement."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Every American adult must be a skilled, literate worker and citizen."
1990,Bush,Republican,Every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn.
1990,Bush,Republican,And every school in America must be drug-free.
1990,Bush,Republican,Ambitious aims?
1990,Bush,Republican,Of course.
1990,Bush,Republican,Easy to do?
1990,Bush,Republican,Far from it.
1990,Bush,Republican,But the future's at stake.
1990,Bush,Republican,The Nation will not accept anything less than excellence in education.
1990,Bush,Republican,These investments will keep America competitive.
1990,Bush,Republican,And I know this about the American people: We welcome competition.
1990,Bush,Republican,"We'll match our ingenuity, our energy, our experience and technology, our spirit and enterprise against anyone."
1990,Bush,Republican,"But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair."
1990,Bush,Republican,America is ready.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Since we really mean it and since we're serious about being ready to meet that challenge, we're getting our own house in order."
1990,Bush,Republican,We have made real progress.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross national product -- 6 percent."
1990,Bush,Republican,"In the new budget I sent up 2 days ago, the deficit is down to 1 percent of gross national product."
1990,Bush,Republican,That budget brings Federal spending under control.
1990,Bush,Republican,It meets the Gramm-Rudman target.
1990,Bush,Republican,It brings that deficit down further and balances the budget by 1993 with no new taxes.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending."
1990,Bush,Republican,"For most of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must when it has bills to pay."
1990,Bush,Republican,We won't leave it to our children and our grandchildren.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national debt."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And there's something more we owe the generations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's precious environmental inheritance."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's just one sign of how serious we are.
1990,Bush,Republican,"We will elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank -- not more bureaucracy, not more redtape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings with other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve."
1990,Bush,Republican,"This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our environment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new initiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves that improve recreational facilities on public lands, and something else, something that will help keep this country clean from our forestland to the inner cities and keep America beautiful for generations to come: the money to plant a billion trees a year."
1990,Bush,Republican,And tonight let me say again to all the Members of the Congress: The American people did not send us here to bicker.
1990,Bush,Republican,"There is work to do, and they sent us here to get it done."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And once again, in the spirit of cooperation, I offer my hand to all of you."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Let's work together to do the will of the people: clean air, child care, the Educational Excellence Act, crime, and drugs."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's time to act.
1990,Bush,Republican,"The farm bill, transportation policy, product-liability reform, enterprise zones -- it's time to act together."
1990,Bush,Republican,And there's one thing I hope we will be able to agree on.
1990,Bush,Republican,It's about our commitments.
1990,Bush,Republican,I'm talking about Social Security.
1990,Bush,Republican,"To every American out there on Social Security, to every American supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they retire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it."
1990,Bush,Republican,"We rescued the system in 1983, and it's sound again -- bipartisan arrangement."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Our budget fully funds today's benefits, and it assures that future benefits will be funded as well."
1990,Bush,Republican,The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security.
1990,Bush,Republican,There's one more problem we need to address.
1990,Bush,Republican,We must give careful consideration to the recommendations of the health-care studies underway now.
1990,Bush,Republican,That's why tonight I'm asking Dr.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Sullivan, Lou Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality, accessibility, and cost of our nation's health-care system."
1990,Bush,Republican,I am committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under control.
1990,Bush,Republican,The state of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very chamber.
1990,Bush,Republican,But the state of the Union depends on all Americans.
1990,Bush,Republican,We must maintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of individuals.
1990,Bush,Republican,I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this country.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate, not next week, not tomorrow, but right now -- every single one of us."
1990,Bush,Republican,The state of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor -- claim the problems of our community as our own.
1990,Bush,Republican,"We've got to step forward when there's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger in need."
1990,Bush,Republican,"We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we learned as children."
1990,Bush,Republican,That's how we sustain the state of the Union.
1990,Bush,Republican,Every effort is important.
1990,Bush,Republican,It all adds up.
1990,Bush,Republican,It's doing the things that give democracy meaning.
1990,Bush,Republican,It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Let me say that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as we live up to the American ideal, the state of the Union will remain sound and strong."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And to those who worry that we've lost our way -- well, I want you to listen to parts of a letter written by Private First Class James Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic of the 1st Battalion, 75th Rangers."
1990,Bush,Republican,"It's dated December 18th, the night before our armed forces went into action in Panama."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's a letter servicemen write and hope will never be sent.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter."
1990,Bush,Republican,She passed it along to me out there in Cincinnati.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And here is some of what he wrote: ``I've never been afraid of death, but I know he is waiting at the corner."
1990,Bush,Republican,"I've been trained to kill and to save, and so has everyone else."
1990,Bush,Republican,"I am frightened what lays beyond the fog, and yet do not mourn for me."
1990,Bush,Republican,Revel in the life that I have died to give you.
1990,Bush,Republican,"But most of all, don't forget the Army was my choice."
1990,Bush,Republican,Something that I wanted to do.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and ensure that you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely.'' Let me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama, and one of the first to fall."
1990,Bush,Republican,But he knew what he believed in.
1990,Bush,Republican,He carried the idea we call America in his heart.
1990,Bush,Republican,I began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year.
1990,Bush,Republican,"There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before us, and there's a need for leadership that only America can provide."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry Truman predicted such a time would come."
1990,Bush,Republican,"He said: ``As our world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the Communist world.'' Today, that change is taking place."
1990,Bush,Republican,"For more than 40 years, America and its allies held communism in check and ensured that democracy would continue to exist."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And today, with communism crumbling, our aim must be to ensure democracy's advance, to take the lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope: a great and growing commonwealth of free nations."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Here in our own hemisphere, it is time for all the peoples of the Americas, North and South, to live in freedom."
1990,Bush,Republican,"In the Far East and Africa, it's time for the full flowering of free governments and free markets that have served as the engine of progress."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe so that continent -- for too long a continent divided -- can see a future whole and free.
1990,Bush,Republican,"It's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity."
1990,Bush,Republican,"We are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great uncertainty."
1990,Bush,Republican,"We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative."
1990,Bush,Republican,"But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe, a coherent defense program that ensures the U.S. will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe."
1990,Bush,Republican,And I've consulted with leaders of NATO.
1990,Bush,Republican,"In fact, I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just today."
1990,Bush,Republican,I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in Europe is essential and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.
1990,Bush,Republican,But our troop levels can still be lower.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And so, tonight I am announcing a major new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side."
1990,Bush,Republican,This level reflects the advice of our senior military advisers.
1990,Bush,Republican,It's designed to protect American and European interests and sustain NATO's defense strategy.
1990,Bush,Republican,"A swift conclusion to our arms control talks -- conventional, chemical, and strategic -- must now be our goal."
1990,Bush,Republican,And that time has come.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: In many regions of the world tonight, the reality is conflict, not peace."
1990,Bush,Republican,Enduring animosities and opposing interests remain.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And thus, the cause of peace must be served by an America strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our ideals."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's this American idea that for the past four decades helped inspire this Revolution of '89.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Here at home and in the world, there's history in the making, history to be made."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity."
1990,Bush,Republican,It's a monument of simple majesty.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Three tall crosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor -- an ancient symbol of hope."
1990,Bush,Republican,"The anchor in our world today is freedom, holding us steady in times of change, a symbol of hope to all the world."
1990,Bush,Republican,And freedom is at the very heart of the idea that is America.
1990,Bush,Republican,Giving life to that idea depends on every one of us.
1990,Bush,Republican,Our anchor has always been faith and family.
1990,Bush,Republican,"In the last few days of this past momentous year, our family was blessed once more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th grandchild."
1990,Bush,Republican,"When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at home and abroad seemed manageable and totally in perspective."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Now, I know you're probably thinking, well, that's just a grandfather talking."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Well, maybe you're right."
1990,Bush,Republican,"But I've met a lot of children this past year across this country, as all of you have, everywhere from the Far East to Eastern Europe."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And all kids are unique, and yet all kids are alike -- the budding young environmentalists I met this month who joined me in exploring the Florida Everglades; the little leaguers I played catch with in Poland, ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series; and even the kids who are ill or alone -- and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and AIDS and coping with problems no child should have to face."
1990,Bush,Republican,"But you know, when it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same -- full of dreams, ready to take on the world -- all special, because they are the very future of freedom."
1990,Bush,Republican,And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking about.
1990,Bush,Republican,"And so, tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Now, let me start with my generation, with the grandparents out there."
1990,Bush,Republican,You are our living link to the past.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles waged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And tell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to tell."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And, parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance."
1990,Bush,Republican,Tell them of faith and family.
1990,Bush,Republican,Tell them we are one nation under God.
1990,Bush,Republican,"Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive liberty is their most precious legacy, and of all the gifts they can give the greatest is helping others."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And to the children and young people out there tonight: With you rests our hope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead."
1990,Bush,Republican,"Fix your vision on a new century -- your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the destiny that is yours and yours alone."
1990,Bush,Republican,"And finally, let all Americans -- all of us together here in this Chamber, the symbolic center of democracy -- affirm our allegiance to this idea we call America."
1990,Bush,Republican,And let us remember that the state of the Union depends on each and every one of us.
1990,Bush,Republican,"God bless all of you, and may God bless this great nation, the United States of America."
1991,Bush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W.
1991,Bush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 29, 1991 Mr."
1991,Bush,Republican,President and Mr.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Speaker and Members of the United States Congress: I come to this House of the people to speak to you and all Americans, certain that we stand at a defining hour."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Halfway around the world, we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies and on the seas and sands."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We know why we're there: We are Americans, part of something larger than ourselves."
1991,Bush,Republican,"For two centuries, we've done the hard work of freedom."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And tonight, we lead the world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity."
1991,Bush,Republican,"What is at stake is more than one small country; it is a big idea: a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind -- peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law."
1991,Bush,Republican,Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children's future.
1991,Bush,Republican,The community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel lawless aggression.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion -- his ruthless, systematic rape of a peaceful neighbor -- violated everything the community of nations holds dear."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The world has said this aggression would not stand, and it will not stand."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Together, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism, and isolation that gives temptation to tyrants."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The world has answered Saddam's invasion with 12 United Nations resolutions, starting with a demand for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal, and backed up by forces from 28 countries of 6 continents."
1991,Bush,Republican,"With few exceptions, the world now stands as one."
1991,Bush,Republican,The end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity.
1991,Bush,Republican,"A year and a half ago, in Germany, I said that our goal was a Europe whole and free."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight, Germany is united."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Europe has become whole and free, and America's leadership was instrumental in making it possible."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Our relationship to the Soviet Union is important, not only to us but to the world."
1991,Bush,Republican,That relationship has helped to shape these and other historic changes.
1991,Bush,Republican,"But like many other nations, we have been deeply concerned by the violence in the Baltics, and we have communicated that concern to the Soviet leadership."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The principle that has guided us is simple: Our objective is to help the Baltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet Union."
1991,Bush,Republican,"In our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership we have been given representations which, if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of some Soviet forces, a reopening of dialog with the Republics, and a move away from violence."
1991,Bush,Republican,We will watch carefully as the situation develops.
1991,Bush,Republican,And we will maintain our contact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to democratization and reform.
1991,Bush,Republican,"If it is possible, I want to continue to build a lasting basis for U.S.-Soviet cooperation -- for a more peaceful future for all mankind."
1991,Bush,Republican,The triumph of democratic ideas in Eastern Europe and Latin America and the continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere all around the world all confirm the wisdom of our nation's founders.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and savage aggression."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th century thankful for our blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties, and responsive to our duties at home and around the world."
1991,Bush,Republican,"For two centuries, America has served the world as an inspiring example of freedom and democracy."
1991,Bush,Republican,"For generations, America has led the struggle to preserve and extend the blessings of liberty."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And today, in a rapidly changing world, American leadership is indispensable."
1991,Bush,Republican,Americans know that leadership brings burdens and sacrifices.
1991,Bush,Republican,But we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are Americans; we have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And when we do, freedom works."
1991,Bush,Republican,The conviction and courage we see in the Persian Gulf today is simply the American character in action.
1991,Bush,Republican,The indomitable spirit that is contributing to this victory for world peace and justice is the same spirit that gives us the power and the potential to meet our toughest challenges at home.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are resolute and resourceful.
1991,Bush,Republican,"If we can selflessly confront the evil for the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all that it should be."
1991,Bush,Republican,"If anyone tells you that America's best days are behind her, they're looking the wrong way."
1991,Bush,Republican,Tonight I come before this House and the American people with an appeal for renewal.
1991,Bush,Republican,"This is not merely a call for new government initiatives; it is a call for new initiatives in government, in our communities, and from every American to prepare for the next American century."
1991,Bush,Republican,America has always led by example.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, who among us will set the example?"
1991,Bush,Republican,Which of our citizens will lead us in this next American century?
1991,Bush,Republican,"Everyone who steps forward today -- to get one addict off drugs, to convince one troubled teenager not to give up on life, to comfort one AIDS patient, to help one hungry child."
1991,Bush,Republican,We have within our reach the promise of a renewed America.
1991,Bush,Republican,"We can find meaning and reward by serving some higher purpose than ourselves, a shining purpose, the illumination of a Thousand Points of Light."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And it is expressed by all who know the irresistible force of a child's hand, of a friend who stands by you and stays there, a volunteer's generous gesture, an idea that is simply right."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them remains the same."
1991,Bush,Republican,It is the individual -- the individual who steps forward.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other -- the sum of our friendships, marriages, families, and communities."
1991,Bush,Republican,We all have something to give.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, if you know how to read, find someone who can't."
1991,Bush,Republican,"If you've got a hammer, find a nail."
1991,Bush,Republican,"If you're not hungry, not lonely, not in trouble, seek out someone who is."
1991,Bush,Republican,Join the community of conscience.
1991,Bush,Republican,Do the hard work of freedom.
1991,Bush,Republican,And that will define the state of our Union.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Since the birth of our nation, ""We the People"" has been the source of our strength."
1991,Bush,Republican,"What government can do alone is limited, but the potential of the American people knows no limits."
1991,Bush,Republican,We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are Americans.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are the Nation that believes in the future.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are the Nation that can shape the future.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And we've begun to do just that, by strengthening the power and choice of individuals and families."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Together, these last 2 years, we've put dollars for child care directly in the hands of parents instead of bureaucracies; unshackled the potential of Americans with disabilities; applied the creativity of the marketplace in the service of the environment, for clean air; and made home ownership possible for more Americans."
1991,Bush,Republican,The strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy.
1991,Bush,Republican,It is in the people and their communities.
1991,Bush,Republican,"In everything we do, let us unleash the potential of our most precious resource -- our citizens, our citizens themselves."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We must return to families, communities, counties, cities, States, and institutions of every kind the power to chart their own destiny and the freedom and opportunity provided by strong economic growth."
1991,Bush,Republican,And that's what America is all about.
1991,Bush,Republican,"I know that tonight, in some regions of our country, people are in genuine economic distress."
1991,Bush,Republican,And I hear them.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Earlier this month, Kathy Blackwell, of Massachusetts, wrote me about what can happen when the economy slows down, saying, ""My heart is aching, and I think that you should know your people out here are hurting badly."" I understand, and I'm not unrealistic about the future."
1991,Bush,Republican,But there are reasons to be optimistic about our economy.
1991,Bush,Republican,"First, we don't have to fight double-digit inflation."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Second, most industries won't have to make big cuts in production because they don't have big inventories piled up."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And third, our exports are running solid and strong."
1991,Bush,Republican,"In fact, American businesses are exporting at a record rate."
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, let's put these times in perspective."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Together, since 1981, we've created almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half, and cut interest rates in half."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And yes, the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been temporarily interrupted."
1991,Bush,Republican,But our economy is still over twice as large as our closest competitor.
1991,Bush,Republican,We will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon.
1991,Bush,Republican,We will get on our way to a new record of expansion and achieve the competitive strength that will carry us into the next American century.
1991,Bush,Republican,"We should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth, investing in the future, and giving power and opportunity to the individual."
1991,Bush,Republican,We must begin with control of Federal spending.
1991,Bush,Republican,That's why I'm submitting a budget that holds the growth in spending to less than the rate of inflation.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And that's why, amid all the sound and fury of last year's budget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps, so that future spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding war."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Though controversial, the budget agreement finally put the Federal Government on a pay-as-you-go plan and cut the growth of debt by nearly $500 billion."
1991,Bush,Republican,And that frees funds for saving and job-creating investment.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Now, let's do more."
1991,Bush,Republican,"My budget again includes tax-free family savings accounts; penalty-free withdrawals from IRA's for first-time home buyers; and to increase jobs and growth, a reduced tax for long-term capital gains."
1991,Bush,Republican,I know there are differences among us -- [laughter] -- about the impact and the effects of a capital gains incentive.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So tonight, I'm asking the congressional leaders and the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by Chairman Alan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering."
1991,Bush,Republican,"But just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future, they must also be matched by long-term investments for the next American century."
1991,Bush,Republican,"That requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that's exactly what we will be sending to the Congress."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We've prepared a detailed series of proposals that include: a budget that promotes investment in America's future -- in children, education, infrastructure, space, and high technology; legislation to achieve excellence in education, building on the partnership forged with the 50 Governors at the education summit, enabling parents to choose their children's schools and helping to make America number one in math and science; a blueprint for a new national highway system, a critical investment in our transportation infrastructure; a research and development agenda that includes record levels of Federal investment, and a permanent tax credit to strengthen private R&D and to create jobs; a comprehensive national energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency, increased development, and greater use of alternative fuels; a banking reform plan to bring America's financial system into the 21st century so that our banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make job-creating loans for our factories, our businesses, and home buyers."
1991,Bush,Republican,"You know, I do think there has been too much pessimism."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Sound banks should be making sound loans now, and interest rates should be lower, now."
1991,Bush,Republican,"In addition to these proposals, we must recognize that our economic strength depends on being competitive in world markets."
1991,Bush,Republican,We must continue to expand American exports.
1991,Bush,Republican,A successful Uruguay round of world trade negotiations will create more real jobs and more real growth for all nations.
1991,Bush,Republican,"You and I know that if the playing field is level, America's workers and farmers can out-work, out-produce anyone, anytime, anywhere."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And with a Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, we can help our partners strengthen their economies and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere."
1991,Bush,Republican,The budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more power and opportunity in the hands of the individual.
1991,Bush,Republican,And that means new incentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment through enterprise zones.
1991,Bush,Republican,It also means tenant control and ownership of public housing.
1991,Bush,Republican,Freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege of wealth.
1991,Bush,Republican,They are the birthright of every American.
1991,Bush,Republican,Civil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Every one of us has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry, and hate."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We will continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes, and I will once again press the Congress to strengthen the laws against employment discrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences."
1991,Bush,Republican,We're determined to protect another fundamental civil right: freedom from crime and the fear that stalks our cities.
1991,Bush,Republican,The Attorney General will soon convene a crime summit of our nation's law enforcement officials.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And to help us support them, we need tough crime control legislation, and we need it now."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And as we fight crime, we will fully implement our national strategy for combating drug abuse."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Recent data show that we are making progress, but much remains to be done."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We will not rest until the day of the dealer is over, forever."
1991,Bush,Republican,Good health care is every American's right and every American's responsibility.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And so, we are proposing an aggressive program of new prevention initiatives -- for infants, for children, for adults, and for the elderly -- to promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from spiraling."
1991,Bush,Republican,It's time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal of the citizen politician who comes not to stay but to serve.
1991,Bush,Republican,And one of the reasons that there is so much support across this country for term limitations is that the American people are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in politics.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, we must look beyond the next election to the next generation."
1991,Bush,Republican,And the time has come to put the national interest above the special interest and to totally eliminate political action committees.
1991,Bush,Republican,And that would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the hands of individuals.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And where power cannot be put directly in the hands of the individual, it should be moved closer to the people, away from Washington."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The Federal Government too often treats government programs as if they are of Washington, by Washington, and for Washington."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Once established, Federal programs seem to become immortal."
1991,Bush,Republican,It's time for a more dynamic program life cycle.
1991,Bush,Republican,Some programs should increase.
1991,Bush,Republican,Some should decrease.
1991,Bush,Republican,Some should be terminated.
1991,Bush,Republican,And some should be consolidated and turned over to the States.
1991,Bush,Republican,My budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more than $20 billion.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Working with Congress and the Governors, I propose we select at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the States in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for flexible management by the States."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The value, the value of this turnover approach is straightforward."
1991,Bush,Republican,It allows the Federal Government to reduce overhead.
1991,Bush,Republican,It allows States to manage more flexibly and more efficiently.
1991,Bush,Republican,It moves power and decisionmaking closer to the people.
1991,Bush,Republican,And it reinforces a theme of this administration: appreciation and encouragement of the innovative powers of States as laboratories.
1991,Bush,Republican,This nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in the hands of people.
1991,Bush,Republican,And they planned for the future.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And so must we, here and all around the world."
1991,Bush,Republican,"As Americans, we know that there are times when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators, toward the brighter promise of a better day."
1991,Bush,Republican,Almost 50 years ago we began a long struggle against aggressive totalitarianism.
1991,Bush,Republican,Now we face another defining hour for America and the world.
1991,Bush,Republican,"There is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman, and coastguardsman, every man and woman now serving in the Persian Gulf."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Oh, how they deserve -- [applause] -- and what a fitting tribute to them."
1991,Bush,Republican,"You see -- what a wonderful, fitting tribute to them."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Each of them has volunteered, volunteered to provide for this nation's defense, and now they bravely struggle to earn for America, for the world, and for future generations a just and lasting peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,Our commitment to them must be equal to their commitment to their country.
1991,Bush,Republican,They are truly America's finest.
1991,Bush,Republican,The war in the Gulf is not a war we wanted.
1991,Bush,Republican,We worked hard to avoid war.
1991,Bush,Republican,"For more than 5 months we -- along with the Arab League, the European Community, the United Nations -- tried every diplomatic avenue."
1991,Bush,Republican,U.N.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterrand, Ozal, Mubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and Andreotti -- just to name a few -- all worked for a solution."
1991,Bush,Republican,"But time and again, Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The world well knows how this conflict began and when: It began on August 2d, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless neighbor."
1991,Bush,Republican,And I am certain of how it will end.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So that peace can prevail, we will prevail. [Applause] Thank you."
1991,Bush,Republican,Tonight I am pleased to report that we are on course.
1991,Bush,Republican,Iraq's capacity to sustain war is being destroyed.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Our investment, our training, our planning -- all are paying off."
1991,Bush,Republican,Time will not be Saddam's salvation.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to ensure the stability and security of this critical region."
1991,Bush,Republican,Let me make clear what I mean by the region's stability and security.
1991,Bush,Republican,"We do not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture, or its people."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Rather, we seek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy, not to serve the ambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itself and its neighbors."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer the rule, where the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate the weak."
1991,Bush,Republican,Most Americans know instinctively why we are in the Gulf.
1991,Bush,Republican,"They know we had to stop Saddam now, not later."
1991,Bush,Republican,"They know that this brutal dictator will do anything, will use any weapon, will commit any outrage, no matter how many innocents suffer."
1991,Bush,Republican,"They know we must make sure that control of the world's oil resources does not fall into his hands, only to finance further aggression."
1991,Bush,Republican,"They know that we need to build a new, enduring peace, based not on arms races and confrontation but on shared principles and the rule of law."
1991,Bush,Republican,And we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in the region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Democracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent, and we've heard some dissenting voices here at home -- some, a handful, reckless; most responsible."
1991,Bush,Republican,But the fact that all voices have the right to speak out is one of the reasons we've been united in purpose and principle for 200 years.
1991,Bush,Republican,Our progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance and a steadfast commitment to a strong defense.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Now, with remarkable technological advances like the Patriot missile, we can defend against ballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Looking forward, I have directed that the SDI program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their source."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Let us pursue an SDI program that can deal with any future threat to the United States, to our forces overseas, and to our friends and allies."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has enabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions and help minimize precious loss of life."
1991,Bush,Republican,We have given our men and women the very best.
1991,Bush,Republican,And they deserve it.
1991,Bush,Republican,We all have a special place in our hearts for the families of our men and women serving in the Gulf.
1991,Bush,Republican,They are represented here tonight by Mrs.
1991,Bush,Republican,Norman Schwarzkopf.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are all very grateful to General Schwarzkopf and to all those serving with him.
1991,Bush,Republican,And I might also recognize one who came with Mrs.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Schwarzkopf: Alma Powell, the wife of the distinguished Chairman of the Joint Chiefs."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And to the families, let me say our forces in the Gulf will not stay there one day longer than is necessary to complete their mission."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The courage and success of the RAF pilots, of the Kuwaiti, Saudi, French, the Canadians, the Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain -- all are proof that for the first time since World War II, the international community is united."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The leadership of the United Nations, once only a hoped-for ideal, is now confirming its founders' vision."
1991,Bush,Republican,I am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial burdens of this struggle.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Last year, our friends and allies provided the bulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And now, having received commitments of over $40 billion for the first 3 months of 1991, I am confident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm."
1991,Bush,Republican,But the world has to wonder what the dictator of Iraq is thinking.
1991,Bush,Republican,"If he thinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia, that he will gain advantage, he is dead wrong."
1991,Bush,Republican,"If he thinks that he will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental terrorism, he is dead wrong."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And if he thinks that by abusing the coalition prisoners of war he will benefit, he is dead wrong."
1991,Bush,Republican,We will succeed in the Gulf.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And when we do, the world community will have sent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or future, who contemplates outlaw aggression."
1991,Bush,Republican,"The world can, therefore, seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held promise of a new world order, where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Yes, the United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Among the nations of the world, only the United States of America has both the moral standing and the means to back it up."
1991,Bush,Republican,We're the only nation on this Earth that could assemble the forces of peace.
1991,Bush,Republican,This is the burden of leadership and the strength that has made America the beacon of freedom in a searching world.
1991,Bush,Republican,This nation has never found glory in war.
1991,Bush,Republican,Our people have never wanted to abandon the blessings of home and work for distant lands and deadly conflict.
1991,Bush,Republican,"If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at all."
1991,Bush,Republican,And all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again.
1991,Bush,Republican,Each of us will measure within ourselves the value of this great struggle.
1991,Bush,Republican,Any cost in lives -- any cost -- is beyond our power to measure.
1991,Bush,Republican,But the cost of closing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to imagine.
1991,Bush,Republican,This we do know: Our cause is just; our cause is moral; our cause is right.
1991,Bush,Republican,Let future generations understand the burden and the blessings of freedom.
1991,Bush,Republican,Let them say we stood where duty required us to stand.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Let them know that, together, we affirmed America and the world as a community of conscience."
1991,Bush,Republican,The winds of change are with us now.
1991,Bush,Republican,"The forces of freedom are together, united."
1991,Bush,Republican,We move toward the next century more confident than ever that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be done -- the hard work of freedom.
1991,Bush,Republican,May God bless the United States of America.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Thank you very, very much."
1991,Bush,Republican,"ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE CESSATION OF THE PERSIAN GULF CONFLICT March 6, 1991 Speaker Foley."
1991,Bush,Republican,Mr.
1991,Bush,Republican,"President, it is customary at joint sessions for the Chair to present the President to the Members of Congress directly and without further comment."
1991,Bush,Republican,"But I wish to depart from tradition tonight and express to you on behalf of the Congress and the country, and through you to the members of our Armed Forces, our warmest congratulations on the brilliant victory of the Desert Storm Operation."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Members of the Congress, I now have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States."
1991,Bush,Republican,The President.
1991,Bush,Republican,Mr.
1991,Bush,Republican,President.
1991,Bush,Republican,And Mr.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Speaker, thank you, sir, for those very generous words spoken from the heart about the wonderful performance of our military."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Members of Congress, 5 short weeks ago I came to this House to speak to you about the state of the Union."
1991,Bush,Republican,We met then in time of war.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight, we meet in a world blessed by the promise of peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,"From the moment Operation Desert Storm commenced on January 16th until the time the guns fell silent at midnight 1 week ago, this nation has watched its sons and daughters with pride, watched over them with prayer."
1991,Bush,Republican,"As Commander in Chief, I can report to you our armed forces fought with honor and valor."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And as President, I can report to the Nation aggression is defeated."
1991,Bush,Republican,The war is over.
1991,Bush,Republican,"This is a victory for every country in the coalition, for the United Nations."
1991,Bush,Republican,"A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy, so well led by our Secretary of State, James Baker."
1991,Bush,Republican,It is a victory for the rule of law and for what is right.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Desert Storm's success belongs to the team that so ably leads our Armed Forces: our Secretary of Defense and our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Dick Cheney and Colin Powell."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And while you're standing -- [laughter] -- this military victory also belongs to the one the British call the ""Man of the Match"" -- the tower of calm at the eye of Desert Storm -- General Norman Schwarzkopf."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And recognizing this was a coalition effort, let us not forget Saudi General Khalid, Britain's General de la Billiere, or General Roquejeoffre of France, and all the others whose leadership played such a vital role."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And most importantly, most importantly of all, all those who served in the field."
1991,Bush,Republican,I thank the Members of this Congress -- support here for our troops in battle was overwhelming.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And above all, I thank those whose unfailing love and support sustained our courageous men and women: I thank the American people."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight, I come to this House to speak about the world -- the world after war."
1991,Bush,Republican,The recent challenge could not have been clearer.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Saddam Hussein was the villain; Kuwait, the victim."
1991,Bush,Republican,"To the aid of this small country came nations from North America and Europe, from Asia and South America, from Africa and the Arab world, all united against aggression."
1991,Bush,Republican,Our uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose: to forge a future that should never again be held hostage to the darker side of human nature.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight in Iraq, Saddam walks amidst ruin."
1991,Bush,Republican,His war machine is crushed.
1991,Bush,Republican,His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed.
1991,Bush,Republican,"His people have been lied to, denied the truth."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And when his defeated legions come home, all Iraqis will see and feel the havoc he has wrought."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And this I promise you: For all that Saddam has done to his own people, to the Kuwaitis, and to the entire world, Saddam and those around him are accountable."
1991,Bush,Republican,"All of us grieve for the victims of war, for the people of Kuwait and the suffering that scars the soul of that proud nation."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We grieve for all our fallen soldiers and their families, for all the innocents caught up in this conflict."
1991,Bush,Republican,"And, yes, we grieve for the people of Iraq, a people who have never been our enemy."
1991,Bush,Republican,My hope is that one day we will once again welcome them as friends into the community of nations.
1991,Bush,Republican,Our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, tonight let me outline four key challenges to be met."
1991,Bush,Republican,"First, we must work together to create shared security arrangements in the region."
1991,Bush,Republican,Our friends and allies in the Middle East recognize that they will bear the bulk of the responsibility for regional security.
1991,Bush,Republican,"But we want them to know that just as we stood with them to repel aggression, so now America stands ready to work with them to secure the peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,"This does not mean stationing U.S. ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula, but it does mean American participation in joint exercises involving both air and ground forces."
1991,Bush,Republican,"It means maintaining a capable U.S. naval presence in the region, just as we have for over 40 years."
1991,Bush,Republican,Let it be clear: Our vital national interests depend on a stable and secure Gulf.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Second, we must act to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles used to deliver them."
1991,Bush,Republican,"It would be tragic if the nations of the Middle East and Persian Gulf were now, in the wake of war, to embark on a new arms race."
1991,Bush,Republican,Iraq requires special vigilance.
1991,Bush,Republican,Until Iraq convinces the world of its peaceful intentions -- that its leaders will not use new revenues to rearm and rebuild its menacing war machine -- Iraq must not have access to the instruments of war.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And third, we must work to create new opportunities for peace and stability in the Middle East."
1991,Bush,Republican,"On the night I announced Operation Desert Storm, I expressed my hope that out of the horrors of war might come new momentum for peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We've learned in the modern age geography cannot guarantee security, and security does not come from military power alone."
1991,Bush,Republican,All of us know the depth of bitterness that has made the dispute between Israel and its neighbors so painful and intractable.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Yet, in the conflict just concluded, Israel and many of the Arab States have for the first time found themselves confronting the same aggressor."
1991,Bush,Republican,"By now, it should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in the Middle East requires compromise."
1991,Bush,Republican,"At the same time, peace brings real benefits to everyone."
1991,Bush,Republican,We must do all that we can to close the gap between Israel and the Arab States -- and between Israelis and Palestinians.
1991,Bush,Republican,The tactics of terror lead absolutely nowhere.
1991,Bush,Republican,There can be no substitute for diplomacy.
1991,Bush,Republican,A comprehensive peace must be grounded in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of territory for peace.
1991,Bush,Republican,This principle must be elaborated to provide for Israel's security and recognition and at the same time for legitimate Palestinian political rights.
1991,Bush,Republican,Anything else would fail the twin test of fairness and security.
1991,Bush,Republican,The time has come to put an end to Arab-Israeli conflict.
1991,Bush,Republican,The war with Iraq is over.
1991,Bush,Republican,"The quest for solutions to the problems in Lebanon, in the Arab-Israeli dispute, and in the Gulf must go forward with new vigor and determination."
1991,Bush,Republican,And I guarantee you: No one will work harder for a stable peace in the region than we will.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Fourth, we must foster economic development for the sake of peace and progress."
1991,Bush,Republican,The Persian Gulf and Middle East form a region rich in natural resources with a wealth of untapped human potential.
1991,Bush,Republican,Resources once squandered on military might must be redirected to more peaceful ends.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are already addressing the immediate economic consequences of Iraq's aggression.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Now, the challenge is to reach higher, to foster economic freedom and prosperity for all the people of the region."
1991,Bush,Republican,By meeting these four challenges we can build a framework for peace.
1991,Bush,Republican,I've asked Secretary of State Baker to go to the Middle East to begin the process.
1991,Bush,Republican,"He will go to listen, to probe, to offer suggestions -- to advance the search for peace and stability."
1991,Bush,Republican,I've also asked him to raise the plight of the hostages held in Lebanon.
1991,Bush,Republican,"We have not forgotten them, and we will not forget them."
1991,Bush,Republican,"To all the challenges that confront this region of the world there is no single solution, no solely American answer."
1991,Bush,Republican,But we can make a difference.
1991,Bush,Republican,America will work tirelessly as a catalyst for positive change.
1991,Bush,Republican,"But we cannot lead a new world abroad if, at home, it's politics as usual on American defense and diplomacy."
1991,Bush,Republican,It's time to turn away from the temptation to protect unneeded weapons systems and obsolete bases.
1991,Bush,Republican,It's time to put an end to micromanagement of foreign and security assistance programs -- micromanagement that humiliates our friends and allies and hamstrings our diplomacy.
1991,Bush,Republican,"It's time to rise above the parochial and the pork barrel, to do what is necessary, what's right, and what will enable this nation to play the leadership role required of us."
1991,Bush,Republican,The consequences of the conflict in the Gulf reach far beyond the confines of the Middle East.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Twice before in this century, an entire world was convulsed by war."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Twice this century, out of the horrors of war hope emerged for enduring peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Twice before, those hopes proved to be a distant dream, beyond the grasp of man."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Until now, the world we've known has been a world divided -- a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict, and cold war."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Now, we can see a new world coming into view."
1991,Bush,Republican,A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
1991,Bush,Republican,"In the words of Winston Churchill, a world order in which ""the principles of justice and fair play protect the weak against the strong. . . ."" A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders."
1991,Bush,Republican,A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.
1991,Bush,Republican,The Gulf war put this new world to its first test.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And my fellow Americans, we passed that test."
1991,Bush,Republican,"For the sake of our principles, for the sake of the Kuwaiti people, we stood our ground."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Because the world would not look the other way, Ambassador al-Sabah, tonight Kuwait is free."
1991,Bush,Republican,And we're very happy about that.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight, as our troops begin to come home, let us recognize that the hard work of freedom still calls us forward."
1991,Bush,Republican,We've learned the hard lessons of history.
1991,Bush,Republican,"The victory over Iraq was not waged as ""a war to end all wars."" Even the new world order cannot guarantee an era of perpetual peace."
1991,Bush,Republican,But enduring peace must be our mission.
1991,Bush,Republican,Our success in the Gulf will shape not only the new world order we seek but our mission here at home.
1991,Bush,Republican,"In the war just ended, there were clear-cut objectives -- timetables -- and, above all, an overriding imperative to achieve results."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We must bring that same sense of self-discipline, that same sense of urgency, to the way we meet challenges here at home."
1991,Bush,Republican,"In my State of the Union Address and in my budget, I defined a comprehensive agenda to prepare for the next American century."
1991,Bush,Republican,Our first priority is to get this economy rolling again.
1991,Bush,Republican,The fear and uncertainty caused by the Gulf crisis were understandable.
1991,Bush,Republican,"But now that the war is over, oil prices are down, interest rates are down, and confidence is rightly coming back."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Americans can move forward to lend, spend, and invest in this, the strongest economy on Earth."
1991,Bush,Republican,We must also enact the legislation that is key to building a better America.
1991,Bush,Republican,"For example, in 1990, we enacted an historic Clean Air Act."
1991,Bush,Republican,And now we've proposed a national energy strategy.
1991,Bush,Republican,We passed a child-care bill that put power in the hands of parents.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And today, we're ready to do the same thing with our schools and expand choice in education."
1991,Bush,Republican,We passed a crime bill that made a useful start in fighting crime and drugs.
1991,Bush,Republican,"This year, we're sending to Congress our comprehensive crime package to finish the job."
1991,Bush,Republican,We passed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.
1991,Bush,Republican,And now we've sent forward our civil rights bill.
1991,Bush,Republican,We also passed the aviation bill.
1991,Bush,Republican,"This year, we've sent up our new highway bill."
1991,Bush,Republican,And these are just a few of our pending proposals for reform and renewal.
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, tonight I call on the Congress to move forward aggressively on our domestic front."
1991,Bush,Republican,Let's begin with two initiatives we should be able to agree on quickly: transportation and crime.
1991,Bush,Republican,"And then, let's build on success with those and enact the rest of our agenda."
1991,Bush,Republican,"If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely the Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days."
1991,Bush,Republican,Let that be a promise we make tonight to the American people.
1991,Bush,Republican,"When I spoke in this House about the state of our Union, I asked all of you: If we can selflessly confront evil for the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all that it should be."
1991,Bush,Republican,"In the time since then, the brave men and women of Desert Storm accomplished more than even they may realize."
1991,Bush,Republican,"They set out to confront an enemy abroad, and in the process, they transformed a nation at home."
1991,Bush,Republican,Think of the way they went about their mission -- with confidence and quiet pride.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Think about their sense of duty, about all they taught us about our values, about ourselves."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We hear so often about our young people in turmoil -- how our children fall short, how our schools fail us, how American products and American workers are second-class."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Well, don't you believe it."
1991,Bush,Republican,The America we saw in Desert Storm was first-class talent.
1991,Bush,Republican,And they did it using America's state-of-the-art technology.
1991,Bush,Republican,We saw the excellence embodied in the Patriot missile and the patriots who made it work.
1991,Bush,Republican,And we saw soldiers who know about honor and bravery and duty and country and the world-shaking power of these simple words.
1991,Bush,Republican,"There is something noble and majestic about the pride, about the patriotism that we feel tonight."
1991,Bush,Republican,"So, to everyone here and everyone watching at home, think about the men and women of Desert Storm."
1991,Bush,Republican,Let us honor them with our gratitude.
1991,Bush,Republican,Let us comfort the families of the fallen and remember each precious life lost.
1991,Bush,Republican,Let us learn from them as well.
1991,Bush,Republican,Let us honor those who have served us by serving others.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Let us honor them as individuals -- men and women of every race, all creeds and colors -- by setting the face of this nation against discrimination, bigotry, and hate."
1991,Bush,Republican,Eliminate them.
1991,Bush,Republican,I'm sure that many of you saw on the television the unforgettable scene of four terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering.
1991,Bush,Republican,"They emerged from their bunker broken, tears streaming from their eyes, fearing the worst."
1991,Bush,Republican,And then there was an American soldier.
1991,Bush,Republican,Remember what he said?
1991,Bush,Republican,"He said: ""It's okay."
1991,Bush,Republican,You're all right now.
1991,Bush,Republican,"You're all right now."" That scene says a lot about America, a lot about who we are."
1991,Bush,Republican,Americans are a caring people.
1991,Bush,Republican,"We are a good people, a generous people."
1991,Bush,Republican,Let us always be caring and good and generous in all we do.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Soon, very soon, our troops will begin the march we've all been waiting for -- their march home."
1991,Bush,Republican,And I have directed Secretary Cheney to begin the immediate return of American combat units from the Gulf.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Less than 2 hours from now, the first planeload of American soldiers will lift off from Saudi Arabia, headed for the U.S.A."
1991,Bush,Republican,"That plane will carry the men and women of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division bound for Fort Stewart, Georgia."
1991,Bush,Republican,This is just the beginning of a steady flow of American troops coming home.
1991,Bush,Republican,Let their return remind us that all those who have gone before are linked with us in the long line of freedom's march.
1991,Bush,Republican,"Americans have always tried to serve, to sacrifice nobly for what we believe to be right."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Tonight, I ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops."
1991,Bush,Republican,"They may have missed Thanksgiving and Christmas, but I can tell you this: For them and for their families, we can make this a holiday they'll never forget."
1991,Bush,Republican,"In a very real sense, this victory belongs to them -- to the privates and the pilots, to the sergeants and the supply officers, to the men and women in the machines and the men and women who made them work."
1991,Bush,Republican,"It belongs to the regulars, to the reserves, to the National Guard."
1991,Bush,Republican,This victory belongs to the finest fighting force this nation has ever known in its history.
1991,Bush,Republican,We went halfway around the world to do what is moral and just and right.
1991,Bush,Republican,"We fought hard and, with others, we won the war."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We lifted the yoke of aggression and tyranny from a small country that many Americans had never even heard of, and we ask nothing in return."
1991,Bush,Republican,"We're coming home now -- proud, confident, heads high."
1991,Bush,Republican,"There is much that we must do, at home and abroad."
1991,Bush,Republican,And we will do it.
1991,Bush,Republican,We are Americans.
1991,Bush,Republican,"May God bless this great nation, the United States of America."
1991,Bush,Republican,"Thank you all very, very much."
1992,Bush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W.
1992,Bush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 28, 1992 Mr."
1992,Bush,Republican,Speaker and Mr.
1992,Bush,Republican,"President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: Thank you very much for that warm reception."
1992,Bush,Republican,"You know, with the big buildup this address has had, I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but I couldn't convince Barbara to deliver it for me. [Laughter] I see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing."
1992,Bush,Republican,"They saw what I did in Japan, and they're just happy they're sitting behind me. [Laughter] I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age."
1992,Bush,Republican,We gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on Earth.
1992,Bush,Republican,"For in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost Biblical proportions."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I'm not sure we've absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened."
1992,Bush,Republican,But communism died this year.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Even as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that I didn't always show the joy that was in my heart."
1992,Bush,Republican,"But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the cold war."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country, now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower."
1992,Bush,Republican,Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right.
1992,Bush,Republican,I will speak of those things.
1992,Bush,Republican,But let me tell you something I've been thinking these past few months.
1992,Bush,Republican,It's a kind of rollcall of honor.
1992,Bush,Republican,For the cold war didn't end; it was won.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I think of those who won it, in places like Korea and Vietnam."
1992,Bush,Republican,And some of them didn't come back.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Back then they were heroes, but this year they were victors."
1992,Bush,Republican,"The long rollcall, all the G.I."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Joes and Janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror."
1992,Bush,Republican,"This may seem frivolous, and I don't mean it so, but it's moving to me how the world saw them."
1992,Bush,Republican,"The world saw not only their special valor but their special style: their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region."
1992,Bush,Republican,"What a group we've put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote ""Kilroy was here"" on the walls of the German stalags to those who left signs in the Iraqi desert that said, ""I saw Elvis."" What a group of kids we've sent out into the world."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And there's another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant, and I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer."
1992,Bush,Republican,No one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country's bill or an alliance's bill.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But for half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed."
1992,Bush,Republican,But it did; doesn't anymore.
1992,Bush,Republican,And here's a fact I wouldn't mind the world acknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory.
1992,Bush,Republican,"So now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down."
1992,Bush,Republican,No longer are they on 'round-the-clock alert.
1992,Bush,Republican,Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And they won't have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war."
1992,Bush,Republican,"My grandchildren don't have to do that and won't have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past."
1992,Bush,Republican,There are still threats.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But the long, drawn-out dread is over."
1992,Bush,Republican,"A year ago tonight, I spoke to you at a moment of high peril."
1992,Bush,Republican,American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America's Armed Forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared and that you endorsed: We liberated Kuwait."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace, an historic first."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And soon after that, at Christmas, the last American hostages came home."
1992,Bush,Republican,Our policies were vindicated.
1992,Bush,Republican,Much good can come from the prudent use of power.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And much good can come of this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the United States of America."
1992,Bush,Republican,And they regard this with no dread.
1992,Bush,Republican,"For the world trusts us with power, and the world is right."
1992,Bush,Republican,They trust us to be fair and restrained.
1992,Bush,Republican,They trust us to be on the side of decency.
1992,Bush,Republican,They trust us to do what's right.
1992,Bush,Republican,I use those words advisedly.
1992,Bush,Republican,"A few days after the war began, I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the Gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough, she would tell them ""that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do."" And she said it all: It was the right thing to do."
1992,Bush,Republican,And we did it together.
1992,Bush,Republican,There were honest differences right here in this Chamber.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops."
1992,Bush,Republican,"This is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast."
1992,Bush,Republican,"For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Two years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era."
1992,Bush,Republican,"But now, this year, with imperial communism gone, that process can be accelerated."
1992,Bush,Republican,Tonight I can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force.
1992,Bush,Republican,These are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do.
1992,Bush,Republican,"After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the B - 2 bombers."
1992,Bush,Republican,We will cancel the small ICBM program.
1992,Bush,Republican,We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles.
1992,Bush,Republican,We will stop all new production of the Peacekeeper missile.
1992,Bush,Republican,And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles.
1992,Bush,Republican,This weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation.
1992,Bush,Republican,"I've informed President Yeltsin that if the Commonwealth, the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles."
1992,Bush,Republican,We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third.
1992,Bush,Republican,And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use.
1992,Bush,Republican,"President Yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and I expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I want you to know that for half a century, American Presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words."
1992,Bush,Republican,"But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend."
1992,Bush,Republican,For the world is still a dangerous place.
1992,Bush,Republican,Only the dead have seen the end of conflict.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And though yesterday's challenges are behind us, tomorrow's are being born."
1992,Bush,Republican,The Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
1992,Bush,Republican,And I make them with confidence.
1992,Bush,Republican,But do not misunderstand me.
1992,Bush,Republican,The reductions I have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years.
1992,Bush,Republican,"By 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office."
1992,Bush,Republican,"These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: This deep, and no deeper."
1992,Bush,Republican,"To do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history."
1992,Bush,Republican,"We must not go back to the days of ""the hollow army."" We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe."
1992,Bush,Republican,I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack.
1992,Bush,Republican,We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I urge you again to pass the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI."
1992,Bush,Republican,"There are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place."
1992,Bush,Republican,"But we are the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And as long as I am President, I will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children."
1992,Bush,Republican,This is a fact: Strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue.
1992,Bush,Republican,And now to our troubles at home.
1992,Bush,Republican,They're not all economic; the primary problem is our economy.
1992,Bush,Republican,There are some good signs.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Inflation, that thief, is down."
1992,Bush,Republican,And interest rates are down.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble, and growth is not what it should be."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart, I know we're in hard times."
1992,Bush,Republican,But I know something else: This will not stand.
1992,Bush,Republican,"In this Chamber, in this Chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm."
1992,Bush,Republican,And we can defeat hard times together.
1992,Bush,Republican,I believe you'll help.
1992,Bush,Republican,"One reason is that you're patriots, and you want the best for your country."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it's the right thing to do.
1992,Bush,Republican,"The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea, that people will do great things if only you set them free."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Well, we're going to set the economy free."
1992,Bush,Republican,"For if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it's that if we can change the world we can change America."
1992,Bush,Republican,We must encourage investment.
1992,Bush,Republican,"We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries, and new jobs."
1992,Bush,Republican,"We must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, redtape, and yes, wasteful Government spending."
1992,Bush,Republican,"None of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen."
1992,Bush,Republican,And the test of a plan isn't whether it's called new or dazzling.
1992,Bush,Republican,The American people aren't impressed by gimmicks; they're smarter on this score than all of us in this room.
1992,Bush,Republican,"The only test of a plan is: Is it sound, and will it work?"
1992,Bush,Republican,We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy.
1992,Bush,Republican,And then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy.
1992,Bush,Republican,"There are certain things that a President can do without Congress, and I'm going to do them."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I have, this evening, asked major Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new Federal regulations that could hinder growth."
1992,Bush,Republican,"In those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American workers and business men and women who've been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I won't neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I've instructed our Government regulators to stop it.
1992,Bush,Republican,I have directed Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible.
1992,Bush,Republican,This should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next 6 months.
1992,Bush,Republican,And our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And that means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges, and jobs building railways."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I have, this evening, directed the Secretary of the Treasury to change the Federal tax withholding tables."
1992,Bush,Republican,"With this change, millions of Americans from whom the Government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the Government withhold less from their paychecks."
1992,Bush,Republican,Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one.
1992,Bush,Republican,"This initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Now, these are the things I can do."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And now, Members of Congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country."
1992,Bush,Republican,You must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs.
1992,Bush,Republican,Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery.
1992,Bush,Republican,I am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance.
1992,Bush,Republican,This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work.
1992,Bush,Republican,Real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we've ever had.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages."
1992,Bush,Republican,My plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers.
1992,Bush,Republican,And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate.
1992,Bush,Republican,"For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from IRA's without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment."
1992,Bush,Republican,"This time, at this hour, I cannot take no for an answer."
1992,Bush,Republican,You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country.
1992,Bush,Republican,Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents.
1992,Bush,Republican,But the demagogs are wrong.
1992,Bush,Republican,"They are wrong, and they know it."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000."
1992,Bush,Republican,A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And so, I'm asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I'll tell you, those of you who say, ""Oh, no, someone who's comfortable may benefit from that,"" you kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan who couldn't sleep at night, worrying that somehow, someone somewhere was out having a good time. [Laughter] The opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this Chamber should be reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy."
1992,Bush,Republican,And maybe it's time that stopped.
1992,Bush,Republican,"This, then, is my short-term plan."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Your part, Members of Congress, requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates."
1992,Bush,Republican,"While my plan is being passed and kicking in, we've got to care for those in trouble today."
1992,Bush,Republican,I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend Federal unemployment benefits.
1992,Bush,Republican,And I ask for congressional action right away.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I thank the committee. [Applause] Well, at last."
1992,Bush,Republican,Let's be frank.
1992,Bush,Republican,Let's be frank.
1992,Bush,Republican,Let me level with you.
1992,Bush,Republican,I know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season. [Laughter] I know and you know that everything I propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms.
1992,Bush,Republican,But I ask you to know what is in my heart.
1992,Bush,Republican,And my aim is to increase our Nation's good.
1992,Bush,Republican,"I'm doing what I think is right, and I am proposing what I know will help."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I pride myself that I'm a prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue."
1992,Bush,Republican,"But I understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement. [Laughter] But let me tell you: Far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well-being of our country."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Members of this Chamber are practical people, and I know you won't resent some practical advice."
1992,Bush,Republican,"When people put their party's fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves."
1992,Bush,Republican,And they will certainly deserve it.
1992,Bush,Republican,"I submit my plan tomorrow, and I'm asking you to pass it by March 20th."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I ask the American people to let you know they want this action by March 20th.
1992,Bush,Republican,"From the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And you know, when principle is at stake I relish a good, fair fight."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I said my plan has two parts, and it does."
1992,Bush,Republican,And it's the second part that is the heart of the matter.
1992,Bush,Republican,For it's not enough to get an immediate burst.
1992,Bush,Republican,We need long-term improvement in our economic position.
1992,Bush,Republican,We all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that America continues as an economic leader of the world.
1992,Bush,Republican,We have that in our power.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future."
1992,Bush,Republican,"First, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade."
1992,Bush,Republican,We will work to open markets everywhere.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And in our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers."
1992,Bush,Republican,And we'll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American free trade agreement and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But changes are here, and more are coming."
1992,Bush,Republican,"The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated."
1992,Bush,Republican,We must be the world's leader in education.
1992,Bush,Republican,And we must revolutionize America's schools.
1992,Bush,Republican,My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal.
1992,Bush,Republican,"My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and help communities create new American schools."
1992,Bush,Republican,Thirty States across the Nation have established America 2000 programs.
1992,Bush,Republican,Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in.
1992,Bush,Republican,Now Congress must join this great movement: Pass my proposals for new American schools.
1992,Bush,Republican,"That was my second long-term proposal, and here's my third: We must make commonsense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the marketplace."
1992,Bush,Republican,We must encourage research and development.
1992,Bush,Republican,"My plan is to make the R&D tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion this year alone, for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs."
1992,Bush,Republican,"It is time for a major, renewed investment in fighting violent street crime."
1992,Bush,Republican,It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together.
1992,Bush,Republican,Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And surely it's true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime, from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for, surely these people have been denied a basic civil right."
1992,Bush,Republican,It is time to restore it.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill."
1992,Bush,Republican,"It is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now."
1992,Bush,Republican,Pass it.
1992,Bush,Republican,Help your country.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Fifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city."
1992,Bush,Republican,"We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things."
1992,Bush,Republican,My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence, Head Start."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Step six, we must reform our health care system."
1992,Bush,Republican,"For this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world."
1992,Bush,Republican,American health costs have been exploding.
1992,Bush,Republican,"This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to 1.6 trillion by the end of the decade."
1992,Bush,Republican,We simply cannot afford this.
1992,Bush,Republican,The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell.
1992,Bush,Republican,"When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes, and you pay the bill."
1992,Bush,Republican,We must make a choice.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Now, some pretend we can have it both ways."
1992,Bush,Republican,"They call it ""play or pay,"" but that expensive approach is unstable."
1992,Bush,Republican,"It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and eventually a system under complete Government control."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Really, there are only two options."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the Government to ration services arbitrarily."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And what we'll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service, and a huge new tax burden."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Or we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Well, let's build on our strengths."
1992,Bush,Republican,My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice.
1992,Bush,Republican,"We make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered, and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And the middle class gets help, too."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems."
1992,Bush,Republican,"We must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice, and reduce the people's nagging daily worry about health insurance."
1992,Bush,Republican,"My plan, the details of which I'll announce very shortly, does just that."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Seventh, we must get the Federal deficit under control."
1992,Bush,Republican,"We now have, in law, enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create."
1992,Bush,Republican,There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But I cannot let them do it, and I won't."
1992,Bush,Republican,"My plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I will not tamper with Social Security, but I would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I would also freeze Federal domestic Government employment.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And with the help of Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve Federal funding."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable."
1992,Bush,Republican,We can get rid of each and every one of them.
1992,Bush,Republican,"You know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have never forgotten: This Government is too big and spends too much."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples: a Lawrence Welk museum, research grants for Belgian endive."
1992,Bush,Republican,"We all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I know how to say it, and I know what I need to make it stick."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Give me the same thing 43 Governors have, the line-item veto, and let me help you control spending."
1992,Bush,Republican,We must put an end to unfinanced Federal Government mandates.
1992,Bush,Republican,"These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties, and States without supplying the money."
1992,Bush,Republican,"If Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere."
1992,Bush,Republican,"After all, a mandate just increases someone else's burden, and that means higher taxes at the State and local level."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Step eight, Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform, and my national energy strategy."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And finally, we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future."
1992,Bush,Republican,"When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in this country: Family matters."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I am announcing tonight a new Commission on America's Urban Families.
1992,Bush,Republican,"I've asked Missouri's Governor John Ashcroft to be Chairman, former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be Cochair."
1992,Bush,Republican,"You know, I had mayors, the leading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day at the White House, and they told me something striking."
1992,Bush,Republican,"They said that every one of them, Republican or Democrat, agreed on one thing, that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family."
1992,Bush,Republican,"They asked for this Commission, and they were right to ask because it's time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound."
1992,Bush,Republican,There's one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child.
1992,Bush,Republican,I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family.
1992,Bush,Republican,"For a family with four kids, that's an increase of $2,000."
1992,Bush,Republican,"This is a good start in the right direction, and it's what we can afford."
1992,Bush,Republican,It's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans.
1992,Bush,Republican,I am asking you to do just that.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I'm asking you to allow people to use money from their IRA's to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties."
1992,Bush,Republican,And I'm asking for more.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare."
1992,Bush,Republican,Americans are the most generous people on Earth.
1992,Bush,Republican,"But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become ""a narcotic"" and a ""subtle destroyer"" of the spirit."
1992,Bush,Republican,Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle.
1992,Bush,Republican,It was never meant to be a habit.
1992,Bush,Republican,It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy.
1992,Bush,Republican,It's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system.
1992,Bush,Republican,"States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive Government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: A responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law."
1992,Bush,Republican,We are going to help this movement.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Often, State reform requires waiving certain Federal regulations."
1992,Bush,Republican,I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every State that asks for our help.
1992,Bush,Republican,"I want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing."
1992,Bush,Republican,"If you read the papers and watch TV, you know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Really, this is not us."
1992,Bush,Republican,This is not who we are.
1992,Bush,Republican,And this is not acceptable.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And so, you have my plan for America."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And I'm asking for big things, but I believe in my heart you'll do what's right."
1992,Bush,Republican,"You know, it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions."
1992,Bush,Republican,"I myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through Congress. [Laughter] You will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine."
1992,Bush,Republican,"But, my friends, the people cannot wait."
1992,Bush,Republican,They need help now.
1992,Bush,Republican,There's a mood among us.
1992,Bush,Republican,People are worried.
1992,Bush,Republican,There's been talk of decline.
1992,Bush,Republican,Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired.
1992,Bush,Republican,And I thought: Really?
1992,Bush,Republican,You go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon.
1992,Bush,Republican,Tell the men and women who put him there.
1992,Bush,Republican,Tell the American farmer who feeds his country and the world.
1992,Bush,Republican,Tell the men and women of Desert Storm.
1992,Bush,Republican,"Moods come and go, but greatness endures."
1992,Bush,Republican,Ours does.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailiness of our lives, we forget: We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth."
1992,Bush,Republican,And we have always risen to the occasion.
1992,Bush,Republican,"And we are going to lift this Nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Because I look at hard times, and I make this vow: This will not stand."
1992,Bush,Republican,"And so, we move on together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world."
1992,Bush,Republican,Thank you.
1992,Bush,Republican,"God bless you, and God bless our beloved country."
1992,Bush,Republican,"Thank you very, very much."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION February 17, 1993 Mr."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Members of the House and the Senate, distinguished Americans here as visitors in this Chamber, as am I."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"It is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech. [Laughter] When Presidents speak to Congress and the Nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range and challenges and opportunities that face the United States."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But this is not an ordinary time, and for all the many tasks that require our attention, I believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite, and to act."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And that is our economy.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"For more than anything else, our task tonight as Americans is to make our economy thrive again."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Let me begin by saying that it has been too long, at least three decades, since a President has come and challenged Americans to join him on a great national journey, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves, how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and later, how they wish to be judged by history."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Like every individual, man and woman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And at this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, Americans have called for change."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Our Nation needs a new direction.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I present to you a comprehensive plan to set our Nation on that new course.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family, and to faith."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We must now break the habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that we are all in this together.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"The conditions which brought us as a Nation to this point are well- known: two decades of low productivity, growth, and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment and underemployment; years of huge Government deficits and declining investment in our future; exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of Americans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough, global economy."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,For too long we have drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups, by partisan bickering, and by the sheer complexity of our problems."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe we can do better because we remain the greatest nation on Earth, the world's strongest economy, the world's only military superpower."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we have the vision, the will, and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and enter it having secured the American dream for ourselves and for future generations."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I well remember 12 years ago President Reagan stood at this very podium and told you and the American people that if our national debt were stacked in thousand-dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, today that stack would reach 267 miles."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I tell you this not to assign blame for this problem.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,There is plenty of blame to go around in both branches of the Government and both parties.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,The time has come for the blame to end.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I did not seek this office to place blame.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I come here tonight to accept responsibility, and I want you to accept responsibility with me."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And if we do right by this country, I do not care who gets the credit for it."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,The plan I offer you has four fundamental components.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"First, it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment, initially by jump-starting the economy in the short term and investing in our people, their jobs, and their incomes over the long run."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present by honoring work and families in every part of our public decisionmaking."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Third, it substantially reduces the Federal deficit honestly and credibly by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of Government revenues, not, as the executive branch has done so often in the past, using the most optimistic ones."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And finally, it seeks to earn the trust of the American people by paying for these plans first with cuts in Government waste and efficiency; second, with cuts, not gimmicks, in Government spending; and by fairness, for a change, in the way additional burdens are borne."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I want to talk with you about what Government can do because I believe Government must do more.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector, and second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"The truth is that as Government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in turn."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Our immediate priority must be to create jobs, create jobs now."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Some people say, ""Well, we're in a recovery, and we don't have to do that."" Well, we all hope we're in a recovery, but we're sure not creating new jobs."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And there's no recovery worth its salt that doesn't put the American people back to work.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"To create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, I call on Congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion to put people to work now, to create a half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our Nation's youth."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Especially I want to emphasize, after the events of last year in Los Angeles and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer jobs for displaced, unemployed young people alone this summer."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And tonight I invite America's business leaders to join us in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, our plan looks beyond today's business cycle because our aspirations extend into the next century."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,The heart of this plan deals with the long term.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,It is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will lower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the Federal budget claimed by interest payments, and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs, and an improved economic competitive position in the world."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction, something no American Government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before, spending must be cut, and taxes must be raised."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"The spending cuts I recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes, and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,The tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Our plan is designed, furthermore, and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the health of American business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest, and better trained workers."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our Nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country, with revenues of under $5 million."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"That's about 90 percent of the firms in America, employing about 40 percent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"With a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from south Boston to south Texas to south central Los Angeles."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"This plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems, in high-speed railways, and high-tech information systems."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with State and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Standing as we are on the edge of a new century, we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And so, we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a North American Free Trade Agreement, with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"At the same time--and I say this to you in both parties and across America tonight, all the people who are listening--it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"This world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive, targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,That's what all our competitors are doing.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century but that are in trouble in America today, like aerospace."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And again I will say we must do this together.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I pledge to you that I will do my best to see that business and labor and Government work together for a change.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail--let me say this again; I feel so strongly about this--all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year, not next year, not 5 years from now but this year, bold steps to reform our health care system."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In 1992, we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,By the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Our families will never be secure, our businesses will never be strong, and our Government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We must do it this year.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,The combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And they are weakening our economy every day.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Reducing health care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in growth and jobs.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any spending program we could promote.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in America.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Later this spring, after the First Lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, I will deliver to Congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families, so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We'll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We'll have to maintain the highest American standards and the right to choose in a system that is the world's finest for all those who can access it.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,But first we must make choices.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We must choose to give the American people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more Americans into agony.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Let me further say that I want to work with all of you on this.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I realize this is a complicated issue.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,But we must address it.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And I believe if there is any chance that Republicans and Democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or anything else could agree on one thing, surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We can do better.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And I will work to do better.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction I propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which I seek in our children.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Half of the 2-year-olds in this country today don't receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Our plan will provide them for every eligible child.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And we know now that we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend by eliminating preventable childhood diseases.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,That's a good investment no matter how you measure it.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I recommend that the women, infants, and children's nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We all know that Head Start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success story."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We all know that it saves money, but today it just reaches barely over one-third of all the eligible children."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Under this plan, every eligible child will be able to get a head start."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,For every dollar we invest today we'll save $3 tomorrow.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have to start thinking about tomorrow.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I've heard that somewhere before. [Laughter] We have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our principals, our parents."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the Education Department to promote strategies that really work in learning."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Money alone is not enough.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,So we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education and the Government for apprenticeship programs in every State in this country to give our people the skills they need.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers too, throughout their career."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,The average 18-year-old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker-training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have got to do better on this.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And finally, I propose a program that got a great response from the American people all across this country last year: a program of national service to make college loans available to all Americans and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or community service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time so they can't beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their knowledge."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"A generation ago when President Kennedy proposed and the United States Congress embraced the Peace Corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of Americans committed to serving people around the world."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In this national service program, we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the Peace Corps."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This program could do for this generation of Members of Congress what the land grant college act did and what the GI bill did for former Congressmen.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In the future, historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving America a new lease on life, if you meet this challenge."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we believe in restoring the values that make America special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"To those who care for our sick, who tend our children, who do our most difficult and tiring jobs, the new direction I propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: By expanding the refundable earned income tax credit, we will make history."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We will reward the work of millions of working poor Americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you've got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Later this year, we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And I know from personal conversations with many people that no one, no one wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet, but say after 2 years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Our next great goal should be to strengthen our families.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I compliment the Congress for passing the Family and Medical Leave Act as a good first step, but it is time to do more."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement system it has ever had.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,It is time to demand that people take responsibility for the children they bring in this world.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And I ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We must pass a tough crime bill.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I support not only the bill which didn't quite make it to the President's desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, to provide bootcamps for first-time nonviolent offenders for more space for the hardened criminals in jail, and I support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Let me say this.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I will make you this bargain: If you will pass the Brady bill, I'll sure sign it."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Let me say now, we should move to the harder parts."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I think it is clear to every American, including every Member of Congress of both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in Washington is not high."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We must restore it.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We must begin again to make Government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized interest groups."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And that beginning must start with real political reform.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I am asking the United States Congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to increase the participation of the American people by passing the motor voter bill promptly.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interest by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Believe me, they were cheering that last section at home."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for Republicans and Democrats alike because it says to the voters back home, ""This is your House."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This is your Senate.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We're your hired hands, and every penny we draw is your money."" Next, to revolutionize Government we have to ensure that we live within our means, and that should start at the top and with the White House."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In the last few days I have announced a cut in the White House staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of Agencies and Departments.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I have cut the Federal bureaucracy, or will over the next 4 years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"It is time for Government to demonstrate, in the condition we're in, that we can be as frugal as any household in America."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And that's why I also want to congratulate the Congress.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I noticed the announcement of the leadership today that Congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I think that is important.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I think it will send a very clear signal to the American people.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But if we really want to cut spending, we're going to have to do more, and some of it will be difficult."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I call for an across- the-board freeze in Federal Government salaries for one year.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And thereafter, during this 4-year period, I recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost of living allowance normally involved in Federal pay increases."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Next, I recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know, and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as I have been."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut Government; we have to rethink the whole way it works."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"When I became President I was amazed at just the way the White House worked, in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay, outmoded ways that didn't take maximum advantage of technology and didn't do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers' money."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,So I want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every Government Department.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to push education reform, as I said, not just to spend more money but to really improve learning."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Some things work, and some things don't."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don't.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to use that Superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyers.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use Federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions, but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from making sensible loans."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I'd like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people, to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,In the end we want people not to need us anymore.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I think that's important.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,But in the end we have to get back to the deficit.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,For years there's been a lot of talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And now I understand why, having dealt with the real numbers for 4 weeks."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,But I believe this plan does; it tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"It puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in Federal priorities, from consumption to investment, in the history of this country at the same time over the next 4 years."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as I go around the country and who've asked it in the past: We're not cutting the deficit just because experts say it's the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why we've got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the American people ought to be engaged in."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers, so that our Government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we don't act now, you and I might not even recognize this Government 10 years from now."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we just stay with the same trends of the last 4 years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And paying interest on that debt will be the costliest Government program of all.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We'll still be the world's largest debtor.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And when Members of Congress come here, they'll be devoting over 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And you'll come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on the dollar, no matter what America's problems are."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And we'll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"This budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the Congressional Budget Office. [Laughter] Well you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I'll point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous Presidents have been."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out of this difficulty.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we're likely to get if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it will turn out better for the American people than we say."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"In the last 12 years, because there were differences over the revenue estimates, you and I know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This is tightening the rein on the Democrats as well as the Republicans.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Let's at least argue about the same set of numbers so the American people will think we're shooting straight with them.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"As I said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to cut the Federal spending by a total of $246 billion."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We are eliminating programs that are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We're slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But many of these programs were justified in their time, and a lot of them are difficult for me to recommend reductions in, some really tough ones for me personally."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the Rural Electric Administration.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,That's a difficult thing for me to recommend.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But I think that I cannot exempt the things that exist in my State or in my experience, if I ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We're going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental abiding interest of the American people.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I have to say that we all know our Government has been just great at building programs.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"The time has come to show the American people that we can limit them too; that we can not only start things, that we can actually stop things."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"About the defense budget, I raise a hope and a caution."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"As we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post- cold-war world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as I am President, I will do everything I can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the American flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And every one of you should make that solemn pledge.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We still have responsibilities around the world.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We are the world's only superpower.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"This is still a dangerous and uncertain time, and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy, our Nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution, and by challenges to the health of our global environment."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I know this economic plan is ambitious, but I honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the United States."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And I think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting Government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past, and by asking more Americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"For the wealthiest, those earning more than $180,000 per year, I ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for Federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We recommend a 10-percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year, and we recommend closing some loopholes that let some people get away without paying any tax at all."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"For businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Our plan seeks to attack tax subsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in America.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I say that as someone who believes that American companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former Governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my State.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But the Tax Code should not express a preference to American companies for moving somewhere else, and it does in particular cases today."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We will seek to ensure that, through effective tax enforcement, foreign corporations who do make money in America simply pay the same taxes that American companies make on the same income."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"To middle class Americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom I ask a contribution tonight, I will say again as I did on Monday night: You're not going alone any more, you're certainly not going first, and you're not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of America's families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Let me be clear: There will also be no new cuts in benefits for Medicare.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"As we move toward the 4th year, with the explosion in health care costs, as I said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be planned cuts in payments to providers, to doctors, to hospitals, to labs, as a way of controlling health care costs."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,But I see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If you'll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Let me repeat this, because I know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in Medicare benefits for any beneficiary.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Secondly, the only change we are making in Social Security is one that has already been publicized."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"The plan does ask older Americans with higher incomes, who do not rely solely on Social Security to get by, to contribute more."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This plan will not affect the 80 percent of Social Security recipients who do not pay taxes on Social Security now.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Those who do not pay tax on Social Security now will not be affected by this plan.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy, and I want to tell you why I selected this and why I think it's a good idea."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I recommend that we adopt a BTU tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence, economically, of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Unlike a carbon tax, that's not too hard on the coal States; unlike a gas tax, that's not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn't increase just when the price of an energy source goes up."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,And it is environmentally responsible.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,It will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Taken together these measures will cost an American family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"It will cost American families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned income tax credit."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what's happened just since the election."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Just since the election, since the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and others who have begun to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan, interest rates have continued to fall long-term."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"That means that for the middle class, who will pay something more each month, if they had any credit needs or demands, their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This can be a wise investment for them and their country now.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"I would also point out what the American people already know, and that is because we're a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And these will be spread fairly, with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under $30,000 and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, I ask all of you to consider this: Whatever you think of the tax program, whatever you think of the spending cuts, consider the cost of not changing."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Remember the numbers that you all know.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade we'll have a $650- billion-a-year deficit."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we just keep on doing what we're doing, by the end of the decade 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year, twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we just keep on doing what we're doing, over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we're condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in income, to more debt, to more disappointment."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Worse, unless we change, unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children's children to a lesser life than we enjoyed."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Once Americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"At present productivity rates, it will take 100 years to double living standards, until our grandchildren's grandchildren are born."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,I say that is too long to wait.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight the American people know we have to change.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,But they're also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"They know that as soon as I leave this Chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan, and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just can't do it."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Our people will be watching and wondering, not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to be business as usual or a real new day, whether we're all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we're working for them."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"We must scale the walls of the people's skepticisms, not with our words but with our deeds."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"After so many years of gridlock and indecision, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results, the American people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This economic plan can't please everybody.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If the package is picked apart, there will be something that will anger each of us, won't please anybody."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"But if it is taken as a whole, it will help all of us."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,So I ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don't like or some particular investment that wasn't made.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"And nobody likes the tax increases, but let's just face facts."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"For 20 years, through administrations of both parties, incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot deny the reality of our condition.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,We have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, the test of this plan cannot be what is in it for me."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,It has got to be what is in it for us.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"If we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinventing our Government, we can lift our country's fortunes again."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, I ask everyone in this Chamber and every American to look simply into your heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,"There is so much good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress."
1993,Clinton,Democratic,This must be America's new direction.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Let us summon the courage to seize it.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,Thank you.
1993,Clinton,Democratic,God bless America.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 25, 1994 Thank you very much."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Mr.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"President, Members of the 103d Congress, my fellow Americans: I'm not at all sure what speech is in the TelePrompTer tonight-- [laughter]--but I hope we can talk about the state of the Union."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this Chamber with such force and grace.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Tip O'Neill liked to call himself ""a man of the House."" And he surely was that."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But even more, he was a man of the people, a bricklayer's son who helped to build the great American middle class."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Tip O'Neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or who sent him here."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight he's smiling down on us for the first time from the Lord's gallery.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But in his honor, may we, too, always remember who we are, where we come from, and who sent us here."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"If we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a fair shot at the American dream, they will do extraordinary things."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our American heritage has always been to master such change, to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our country drifted."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"For 30 years, family life in America has been breaking down."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"For 20 years, the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"For the 12 years of trickle-down economics, we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"From 1989 to 1992, we experienced the slowest growth in a half century."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"For too many families, even when both parents were working, the American dream has been slipping away."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"In 1992, the American people demanded that we change."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,A year ago I asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, we did."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And I want to thank every one of you here who heard the American people, who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a President and a Congress in 30 years."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"This Congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars, cut spending, and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest Americans."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This Congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward work over welfare.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It produced NAFTA.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It produced the Brady bill, now the Brady law."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And thank you, Jim Brady, for being here, and God bless you, sir."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This Congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of 9 out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It produced more research and treatment for AIDS, more childhood immunizations, more support for women's health research, more affordable college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"This Congress produced a new law, the motor voter bill, to help millions of people register to vote."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It produced family and medical leave.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,All passed.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,All signed into law with not one single veto.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,These accomplishments were all commitments I made when I sought this office.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this Congress."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But I am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fire."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But what we do here is really beginning to change lives.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Let me just give you one example.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father I met early one Sunday morning in the White House.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It was unusual to see a family there touring early Sunday morning, but he had his wife and his three children there, one of them in a wheelchair."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, I was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, ""Mr."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"President, let me tell you something."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,My little girl here is desperately ill.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,She's probably not going to make it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But because of the family leave law, I was able to take time off to spend with her, the most important time I ever spent in my life, without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It means more to me than I will ever be able to say.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Don't you people up here ever think what you do doesn't make a difference.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It does."" Though we are making a difference, our work has just begun."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Many Americans still haven't felt the impact of what we've done.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The recovery still hasn't touched every community or created enough jobs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Incomes are still stagnant.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,There's still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to reward work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad, and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs, to renew our own American community."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Last year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We cut $255 billion in spending, including entitlements, and over 340 separate budget items."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Led by the Vice President, we launched a campaign to reinvent Government."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of Federal limousines."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"After years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose action expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next 5 years."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"By the time we have finished, the Federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980's, we did ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more to reduce the deficit."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"So on April the 15th, the American people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Only the top 1--[applause]--yes, listen, the top 1.2 percent of Americans, as I said all along, will pay higher income tax rates."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Let me repeat: Only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans will face higher income tax rates, and no one else will."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And that is the truth.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said this plan wouldn't work."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But they were wrong.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"When I became President, the experts predicted that next year's deficit would be $300 billion."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But because we acted, those same people now say the deficit is going to be under $180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And because those interest rates are down, business investment and equipment is growing at 7 times the rate of the previous 4 years."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Auto sales are way up.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Home sales are at a record high.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Millions of Americans have refinanced their homes, and our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993, more than were created in the previous 4 years combined."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early results.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Proud.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But everyone in this Chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Next month I will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to Congress.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It will cut spending in more than 300 programs, eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reform the ways in which governments buy goods and services."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We must do it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or the middle class, and without putting our national security at risk."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"If you will stick with this plan, we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since Harry Truman lived in the White House."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And once again, the buck stops here."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"In one year, with NAFTA, with GATT, with our efforts in Asia and the National Export Strategy, we did more to open world markets to American products than at any time in the last two generations."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That means more jobs and rising living standards for the American people, low deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers, and high investments."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,These are the building blocks of our recovery.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all know we must do more."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"As we reduce defense spending, I ask Congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"As we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This year we will fight for a revitalized Clean Water Act and a Safe Drinking Water Act and a reformed Superfund program.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And the Vice President is right, we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in America into a national information super highway by the year 2000."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Think of it, instant access to information will increase productivity, will help to educate our children."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It will provide better medical care.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It will create jobs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And I call on the Congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"As we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws, because America will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But we all know, too, we can do all these things, put our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the future, guarantee equal opportunity, but if we're honest, we'll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education, training, and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We must set tough, world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our Goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: Are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy?"
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And I hope Congress will pass it without delay.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"After all, most of the people we're counting on to build our economic future won't graduate from college."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It's time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We've got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs, because most of those old jobs just don't come back."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And we know that the only way to have real job security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,So we've got to streamline today's patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skills for our people who lose their jobs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Reemployment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I urge you to pass it in this session of Congress.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also revolutionize our welfare system."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It doesn't work.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It defies our values as a Nation.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"If we value work, we can't justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"If we value responsibility, we can't ignore the $34 billion in child support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"If we value strong families, we can't perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the Government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent?
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That's not just bad policy, it's wrong."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And we ought to change it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I worked on this problem for years before I became President, with other Governors and with Members of Congress of both parties and with the previous administration of another party."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I worked on it with people who were on welfare, lots of them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And I want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They want to get off welfare.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They want to go back to work.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They want to do right by their kids.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I once had a hearing when I was a Governor, and I brought in people on welfare from all over America who had found their way to work."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The woman from my State who testified was asked this question: What's the best thing about being off welfare and in a job?
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And without blinking an eye, she looked at 40 Governors, and she said, ""When my boy goes to school and they say what does you mother do for a living, he can give an answer."" These people want a better system, and we ought to give it to them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Last year we began this.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We gave the States more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside Washington, and many States are already using it."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Then this Congress took a dramatic step.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned-income tax credit."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It will lift 15 million working families out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Now that's real welfare reform.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But there is more to be done.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We'll say to teenagers, ""If you have a child out of wedlock, we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We want families to stay together;"" say to absent parents who aren't paying their child support, ""If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, suspend your license, track you across State lines, and if necessary, make some of you work off what you owe."" People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple compact."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We'll provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to 2 years."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But after that, anyone who can work, must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service, if necessary."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That's the only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance, not a way of life."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But let me point out, I think it is inevitable and imperative."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because it's the only way they can get health care coverage for their children.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits, and many entry-level jobs don't have health benefits, find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,No wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We've got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"So this year, we will make history by reforming the health care system."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And I would say to you, all of you, my fellow public servants, this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, the First Lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across America and from all walks of life."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to share just one of them with you.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Richard Anderson of Reno, Nevada, lost his job and with it, his health insurance."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Two weeks later his wife, Judy, suffered a cerebral aneurysm."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"He rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"The Andersons' bills were over $120,000."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Although Judy recovered and Richard went back to work at $8 an hour, the bills were too much for them, and they were literally forced into bankruptcy. ""Mrs."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Clinton,"" he wrote to Hillary, ""no one in the United States of America should have to lose everything they've worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill."" It was to help the Richard and Judy Andersons of America that the First Lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We owe them our thanks and our action.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I know there are people here who say there's no health care crisis.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Tell it to Richard and Judy Anderson.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Tell it to the 58 million Americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Tell it to the 81 million Americans with those preexisting conditions.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Those folks are paying more, or they can't get insurance at all."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Or they can't ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Tell it to the small businesses burdened by the skyrocketing cost of insurance.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Most small businesses cover their employees, and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or Government."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Or tell it to the 76 percent of insured Americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"So if any of you believe there's no crisis, you tell it to those people, because I can't."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,There are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people's lives.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And all you have to do is go out and listen to them.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They're Republicans and Democrats and independents; it doesn't have a lick to do with party.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They think we don't get it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And it's time we show them that we do get it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"From the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care system: the world's best health care professionals, cutting-edge research and wonderful research institutions, Medicare for older Americans."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"None of this, none of it should be put at risk."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But we're paying more and more money for less and less care.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Every year fewer and fewer Americans even get to choose their doctors.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"This system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and everybody knows it."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"In today's health care system, insurance companies call the shots."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They pick whom they cover and how they cover them.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They are in charge.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,What does it mean?
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It means every night millions of well-insured Americans go to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It means every morning millions of Americans go to work without any health insurance at all, something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It means that every year, more and more hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And countless others turn down better jobs because they know if they take the better job, they will lose their health insurance."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"If we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will have people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bills."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, our approach protects the quality of care and people's choices."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It builds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer- based coverage, to guarantee private insurance for every American."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And I might say, employer-based private insurance for every American was proposed 20 years ago by President Richard Nixon to the United States Congress."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It was a good idea then, and it's a better idea today."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Why do we want guaranteed private insurance?
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Because right now 9 out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employers.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And that should continue.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices, that should continue, too."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,That ought to make the Congress and the President feel better.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our goal is health insurance everybody can depend on: comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs; health premiums that don't just explode when you get sick or you get older; the power, no matter how small your business is, to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates governments and big business get today; one simple form for people who are sick; and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Our approach protects older Americans.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Every plan before the Congress proposes to slow the growth of Medicare.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The difference is this: We believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Medicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we should take the first steps in covering long- term care."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"To those who would cut Medicare without protecting seniors, I say the solution to today's squeeze on middle-class working people's health care is not to put the squeeze on middle-class retired people's health care."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We can do better than that.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"When it's all said and done, it's pretty simple to me."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Insurance ought to mean what it used to mean: You pay a fair price for security, and when you get sick, health care's always there, no matter what."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Along with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too, there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,People have to take their kids to get immunized.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We should all take advantage of preventive care.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We have to practice better health habits, and we can't abuse the system."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And those who don't have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but they'll have to pay something for it, too."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"The minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others, should contribute something."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,People who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,There can't be any more something for nothing.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It will not be easy but it can be done.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, in the coming months I hope very much to work with both Democrats and Republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,President Roosevelt tried.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,President Truman tried.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,President Nixon tried.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,President Carter tried.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But not this time.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I know that facing up to these interests will require courage.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"The work of change, frankly, will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this current system."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,So I also must now call on you to finish the job both Houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, my fellow Americans, this is really a test for all of us."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The American people provide those of us in Government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We have health care that's always there.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I think we need to give every hard-working, tax- paying American the same health care security they have already given to us."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I want to make this very clear.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I am open, as I have said repeatedly, to the best ideas of concerned Members of both parties."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I have no special brief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: If you send me legislation that does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over again."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But I don't think that's going to happen.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I think we're ready to act now.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I believe that you're ready to act now.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And if you're ready to guarantee every American the same health care that you have, health care that can never be taken away, now, not next year or the year after, now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Now.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"As we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This is a promising moment.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Because of the agreements we have reached this year, last year, Russia's strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the United States, nor will we point ours at them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Instead of building weapons in space, Russian scientists will help us to build the international space station."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over, and fanatics who seek to cripple the world's cities with terror."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"As the world's greatest power, we must, therefore, maintain our defenses and our responsibilities."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We achieved agreements with Ukraine, with Belarus, with Kazahkstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We are working to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And earlier today, we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But nothing, nothing is more important to our security than our Nation's Armed Forces."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We honor their contributions, including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in Bosnia, those who will complete their mission in Somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Our forces are the finest military our Nation has ever had.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And I have pledged that as long as I am President, they will remain the best equipped, the best trained, and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the Earth."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Last year I proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-cold-war security at a lower cost.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other Government programs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I said, no."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The budget I send to Congress draws the line against further defense cuts.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It protects the readiness and quality of our forces.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Ultimately, the best strategy is to do that."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We must not cut defense further.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I hope the Congress, without regard to party, will support that position."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Democracies don't attack each other, they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That is why we have supported, you and I, the democratic reformers in Russia and in the other states of the former Soviet bloc."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I applaud the bipartisan support this Congress provided last year for our initiatives to help Russia, Ukraine, and the other states through their epic transformations."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We will continue to urge Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And we will seek to cooperate with Russia to solve regional problems, while insisting that if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures-- and they must chart their own futures--how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reforms succeed all across the former Communist bloc.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our policy has been to support that move, and that has been the policy of the Congress."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We should continue it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That is why I went to Europe earlier this month, to work with our European partners, to help to integrate all the former Communist countries into a Europe that has a possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history, its entire history, based on the simple commitments of all nations in Europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for existing borders."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,With our allies we have created a Partnership For Peace that invites states from the former Soviet bloc and other non-NATO members to work with NATO in military cooperation.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"When I met with Central Europe's leaders, including Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, men who put their lives on the line for freedom, I told them that the security of their region is important to our country's security."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We will ask Congress to ratify the new GATT accord.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We will continue standing by South Africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We will convene a summit of the Western Hemisphere's democratic leaders from Canada to the tip of South America.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in Haiti.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And as we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation's human rights record."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We will also work for new progress toward the Middle East peace.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Last year the world watched Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat at the White House when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But there is a long, hard road ahead."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And on that road I am determined that I and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war, America should turn its back on the rest of the world."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Many around the world were afraid we would do just that.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But I took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge, to keep our Nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And this year, because of our work together, enacting NAFTA, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed America's leadership, America's engagement."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And as a result, the American people are more secure than they were before."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But while Americans are more secure from threats abroad, I think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Every day the national peace is shattered by crime.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"In Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,An ordinary train ride on Long Island ends in a hail of 9-millimeter rounds.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,A tourist in Florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Right here in our Nation's Capital, a brave young man named Jason White, a policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"The crime bill before Congress gives you a chance to do something about it, a chance to be tough and smart."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,What does that mean?
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Let me begin by saying I care a lot about this issue.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Many years ago, when I started out in public life, I was the attorney general of my State."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I served as a Governor for a dozen years.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I know what it's like to sign laws increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I understand this issue.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And it is not a simple thing.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"First, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Now those who commit crimes should be punished.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And those who commit repeated, violent crimes should be told, ""When you commit a third violent crime, you will be put away, and put away for good."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Three strikes, and you are out."" Second, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime, beginning with more police officers and more community policing."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We know right now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the respect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Look at the experience of Houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Here tonight is one of those community policemen, a brave, young detective, Kevin Jett, whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in New York."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connections to the people whose lives he protects.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to ask him to stand up and be recognized tonight.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, sir. [Applause] You will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law-abiding working people of this country--and don't forget, in the toughest neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country, the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay their taxes, do their best to raise their kids."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,They deserve people like Kevin Jett.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And you're going to be given a chance to give the American people another 100,000 of them, well trained."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,And I urge you to do it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"You have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers; which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces, an inordinate resource for our country; one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,These are important things.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"The third thing we have to do is to build on the Brady bill, the Brady law, to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I want to say something about this issue.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Hunters must always be free to hunt.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,I respect that part of our culture; I grew up in it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But I want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I say to you, I know you didn't create this problem, but we need your help to solve it."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,There is no sporting purpose on Earth that should stop the United States Congress from banishing assault weapons that out-gun police and cut down children.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise again among our young people."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The crime bill contains--all the crime bills contain--more money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our administration's budget, with all its cuts, contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,You must pass them both.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We need them desperately.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, the problem of violence is an American problem."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,It has no partisan or philosophical element.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Therefore, I urge you to find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But further, I urge you to consider this: As you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad point."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"In our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our poorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,This has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"So I ask you to remember that even as we say ""no"" to crime, we must give people, especially our young people, something to say ""yes"" to."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Many of our initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service, will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen families, to provide work."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,But more needs to be done.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"That's what our community empowerment agenda is all about, challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs, opportunity, and hope where they're needed most."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I think you know that to really solve this problem, we'll all have to put our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some new ideas to do even more."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"And let's be honest, we all know something else too: Our problems go way beyond the reach of Government."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"They're rooted in the loss of values, in the disappearance of work, and the breakdown of our families and our communities."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs, promote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care, pass the toughest crime bill in history, but still leave too many of our people behind."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,The American people have got to want to change from within if we're going to bring back work and family and community.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot renew this country when 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We can't renew our country when children are having children, and the fathers walk away as if the kids don't amount to anything."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,We can't renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We can't renew our country unless more of us--I mean, all of us--are willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all the ministers I've worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns I met at Our Lady of Help in east Los Angeles or my good friend Tony Campollo in Philadelphia, unless we're willing to work with people like that, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,All of us can do that.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"We can't renew our country until we realize that governments don't raise children, parents do."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Parents who know their children's teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong, those kinds of parents can make all the difference."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I know, I had one."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"I'm telling you, we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Our country needs it, we need it, and they deserve it."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"So I say to you tonight, let's give our children a future."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Let us take away their guns and give them books.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law, respect our neighbors, and cherish our values."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,Let us weave these sturdy threads into a new American community that can once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow.
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won't be equal to the challenges of this time."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But they misread our history, our heritage."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Even today's headlines, all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"When the Earth shook and fires raged in California, when I saw the Mississippi deluge the farmlands of the Midwest in a 500-year flood, when the century's bitterest cold swept from North Dakota to Newport News, it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"But the American people, they just came together."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"They rose to the occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers, showing the better angels of our nature."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us instead be true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together, bringing hope, and moving forward."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, my fellow Americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old as the Republic itself: What is the state of our Union?"
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"It is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"With your help, and God's help, it will be."
1994,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, and God bless America."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 24, 1995 Mr."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"President, Mr."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Members of the 104th Congress, my fellow Americans: Again we are here in the sanctuary of democracy, and once again our democracy has spoken."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"So let me begin by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Speaker.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992. [Laughter] I must say that in both years we didn't hear America singing, we heard America shouting."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And now all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say, ""We hear you."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"For we are the keepers of a sacred trust, and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era."" Over 200 years ago, our Founders changed the entire course of human history by joining together to create a new country based on a single powerful idea: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It has fallen to every generation since then to preserve that idea, the American idea, and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different times: to Lincoln and to his Congress to preserve the Union and to end slavery; to Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson to restrain the abuses and excesses of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world; to Franklin Roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the Great Depression and to win our country's great struggle against fascism; and to all our Presidents since to fight the cold war."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Especially, I recall two who struggled to fight that cold war in partnership with Congresses where the majority was of a different party: to Harry Truman, who summoned us to unparalleled prosperity at home and who built the architecture of the cold war; and to Ronald Reagan, whom we wish well tonight and who exhorted us to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism was won."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In another time of change and challenge, I had the honor to be the first President to be elected in the post-cold-war era, an era marked by the global economy, the information revolution, unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the American people."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I came to this hallowed Chamber 2 years ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strongest force for freedom and democracy in the entire world."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I was determined then to tackle the tough problems too long ignored.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In this effort I am frank to say that I have made my mistakes, and I have learned again the importance of humility in all human endeavor."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But I am also proud to say tonight that our country is stronger than it was 2 years ago. [Applause] Thank you.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Record numbers of Americans are succeeding in the new global economy.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We are at peace, and we are a force for peace and freedom throughout the world."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We have almost 6 million new jobs since I became President, and we have the lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 years."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our businesses are more productive.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And here we have worked to bring the deficit down, to expand trade, to put more police on our streets, to give our citizens more of the tools they need to get an education and to rebuild their own communities."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But the rising tide is not lifting all boats.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"While our Nation is enjoying peace and prosperity, too many of our people are still working harder and harder, for less and less."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"While our businesses are restructuring and growing more productive and competitive, too many of our people still can't be sure of having a job next year or even next month."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And far more than our material riches are threatened, things far more precious to us, our children, our families, our values."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our civil life is suffering in America today.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Citizens are working together less and shouting at each other more.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The common bonds of community which have been the great strength of our country from its very beginning are badly frayed.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,What are we to do about it?
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"More than 60 years ago, at the dawn of another new era, President Roosevelt told our Nation, ""New conditions impose new requirements on Government and those who conduct Government."" And from that simple proposition, he shaped the New Deal, which helped to restore our Nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their Government for half a century."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That approach worked in its time.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But we today, we face a very different time and very different conditions."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We are moving from an industrial age built on gears and sweat to an information age demanding skills and learning and flexibility.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Our Government, once a champion of national purpose, is now seen by many as simply a captive of narrow interests, putting more burdens on our citizens rather than equipping them to get ahead."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The values that used to hold us all together seem to be coming apart.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,So tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenges of this time.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"As we enter a new era, we need a new set of understandings, not just with Government but, even more important, with one another as Americans."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That's what I want to talk with you about tonight.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I call it the New Covenant.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But it's grounded in a very, very old idea, that all Americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their God-given talents and determination can take them and to give something back to their communities and their country in return."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Opportunity and responsibility: They go hand in hand.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We can't have one without the other.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And our national community can't hold together without both.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Our New Covenant is a new set of understandings for how we can equip our people to meet the challenges of a new economy, how we can change the way our Government works to fit a different time, and, above all, how we can repair the damaged bonds in our society and come together behind our common purpose."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We must have dramatic change in our economy, our Government, and ourselves."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, without regard to party, let us rise to the occasion."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Let us put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"As we embark on this new course, let us put our country first, remembering that regardless of party label, we are all Americans."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And let the final test of everything we do be a simple one: Is it good for the American people?
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Let me begin by saying that we cannot ask Americans to be better citizens if we are not better servants.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You made a good start by passing that law which applies to Congress all the laws you put on the private sector, and I was proud to sign it yesterday."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way things work around here.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Three times as many lobbyists are in the streets and corridors of Washington as were here 20 years ago.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The American people look at their Capital, and they see a city where the well-connected and the well-protected can work the system, but the interests of ordinary citizens are often left out."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"As the new Congress opened its doors, lobbyists were still doing business as usual; the gifts, the trips, all the things that people are concerned about haven't stopped."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Twice this month you missed opportunities to stop these practices.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know there were other considerations in those votes, but I want to use something that I've heard my Republican friends say from time to time, ""There doesn't have to be a law for everything."" So tonight I ask you to just stop taking the lobbyists' perks."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Just stop.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We don't have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the American people that things are really changing.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But I also hope you will send me the strongest possible lobby reform bill, and I'll sign that, too."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We should require lobbyists to tell the people for whom they work what they're spending, what they want."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should also curb the role of big money in elections by capping the cost of campaigns and limiting the influence of PAC's.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And as I have said for 3 years, we should work to open the airwaves so that they can be an instrument of democracy, not a weapon of destruction, by giving free TV time to candidates for public office."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"When the last Congress killed political reform last year, it was reported in the press that the lobbyists actually stood in the Halls of this sacred building and cheered."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, let's give the folks at home something to cheer about."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"More important, I think we all agree that we have to change the way the Government works."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's make it smaller, less costly, and smarter; leaner, not meaner. [Applause] I just told the Speaker the equal time doctrine is alive and well. [Laughter] The New Covenant approach to governing is as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer is from the manual typewriter."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The old way of governing around here protected organized interests.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should look out for the interests of ordinary people.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The old way divided us by interest, constituency, or class."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The New Covenant way should unite us behind a common vision of what's best for our country.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The old way dispensed services through large, top-down, inflexible bureaucracies."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The New Covenant way should shift these resources and decisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The old way of governing around here actually seemed to reward failure.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The New Covenant way should have built-in incentives to reward success.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The old way was centralized here in Washington.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The New Covenant way must take hold in the communities all across America.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we should help them to do that.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Our job here is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy, to empower people to make the most of their own lives, and to enhance our security here at home and abroad."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We must not ask Government to do what we should do for ourselves.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should rely on Government as a partner to help us to do more for ourselves and for each other.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matters, we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there is somehow a program for every problem, on the one hand, and the other illusion that the Government is a source of every problem we have."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our job is to get rid of yesterday's Government so that our own people can meet today's and tomorrow's needs.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we ought to do it together.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, for years before I became President, I heard others say they would cut Government and how bad it was, but not much happened."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We actually did it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We cut over a quarter of a trillion dollars in spending, more than 300 domestic programs, more than 100,000 positions from the Federal bureaucracy in the last 2 years alone."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Based on decisions already made, we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million positions from the Federal Government, making it the smallest it has been since John Kennedy was President, by the time I come here again next year."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, our initiatives have already saved taxpayers $63 billion."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The age of the $500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on ""David Letterman"" is gone."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Deadwood programs, like mohair subsidies, are gone."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We've streamlined the Agriculture Department by reducing it by more than 1,200 offices."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We've slashed the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We've thrown away the Government's 10,000-page personnel manual."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And the Government is working better in important ways: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has gone from being a disaster to helping people in disasters."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You can ask the farmers in the Middle West who fought the flood there or the people in California who have dealt with floods and earthquakes and fires, and they'll tell you that."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Government workers, working hand in hand with private business, rebuilt southern California's fractured freeways in record time and under budget."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And because the Federal Government moved fast, all but one of the 5,600 schools damaged in the earthquake are back in business."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, there are a lot of other things that I could talk about."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I want to just mention one because it will be discussed here in the next few weeks.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"University administrators all over the country have told me that they are saving weeks and weeks of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program, which makes college loans cheaper and more affordable with better repayment terms for students, costs the Government less, and cuts out paperwork and bureaucracy for the Government and for the universities."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We shouldn't cap that program.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should give every college in America the opportunity to be a part of it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Previous Government programs gathered dust.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The reinventing Government report is getting results.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we're not through.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,There's going to be a second round of reinventing Government.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We propose to cut $130 billion in spending by shrinking departments, extending our freeze on domestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, getting rid of over 100 programs we do not need, like the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Helium Reserve Program."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we're working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We have to cut yesterday's Government to help solve tomorrow's problems.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we need to get Government closer to the people it's meant to serve.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We need to help move programs down to the point where States and communities and private citizens in the private sector can do a better job.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If they can do it, we ought to let them do it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should get out of the way and let them do what they can do better.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to communities and individuals is something everyone should be able to be for.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It's time for Congress to stop passing on to the States the cost of decisions we make here in Washington.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know there are still serious differences over the details of the unfunded mandates legislation, but I want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interests and give justified relief where we need to give it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"For years, Congress concealed in the budget scores of pet spending projects."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Last year was no difference.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,There was a $1 million to study stress in plants and $12 million for a tick removal program that didn't work.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It's hard to remove ticks.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Those of us who have had them know. [Laughter] But I'll tell you something, if you'll give me line-item veto, I'll remove some of that unnecessary spending."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But I think we should all remember, and almost all of us would agree, that Government still has important responsibilities."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our young people--we should think of this when we cut--our young people hold our future in their hands.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We still owe a debt to our veterans.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And our senior citizens have made us what we are.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, my budget cuts a lot."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But it protects education, veterans, Social Security, and Medicare, and I hope you will do the same thing."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You should, and I hope you will."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And when we give more flexibility to the States, let us remember that there are certain fundamental national needs that should be addressed in every State, North and South, East and West: Immunization against childhood disease, school lunches in all our schools, Head Start, medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants-- [applause]--medical care and nutrition for pregnant women and infants, all these things, all these things are in the national interest."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But when we deregulate, let's remember what national action in the national interest has given us: safer food for our families, safer toys for our children, safer nursing homes for our parents, safer cars and highways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air, and cleaner water."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Do we need common sense and fairness in our regulations?
1995,Clinton,Democratic,You bet we do.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We can have fairness and still clean up toxic dumps, and we ought to do it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Should we cut the deficit more?
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, of course we should."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Of course we should.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But we can bring it down in a way that still protects our economic recovery and does not unduly punish people who should not be punished but instead should be helped.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I know many of you in this Chamber support the balanced budget amendment.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I certainly want to balance the budget.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Our administration has done more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very, very long time."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If you believe passing this amendment is the right thing to do, then you have to be straight with the American people."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"They have a right to know what you're going to cut, what taxes you're going to raise, and how it's going to affect them."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should be doing things in the open around here.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"For example, everybody ought to know if this proposal is going to endanger Social Security."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I would oppose that, and I think most Americans would."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our failed welfare system.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,This is one of the problems we have to face here in Washington in our New Covenant.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It rewards welfare over work.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It undermines family values.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It lets millions of parents get away without paying their child support.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It keeps a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trapped on it for a very long time.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I've worked on this problem for a long time, nearly 15 years now."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"As a Governor, I had the honor of working with the Reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In the last 2 years, we made a good start at continuing the work of welfare reform."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our administration gave two dozen States the right to slash through Federal rules and regulations to reform their own welfare systems and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Last year I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever presented by an administration.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We have to make welfare what it was meant to be, a second chance, not a way of life."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible, to provide child care and teach them skills, if that's what they need, for up to 2 years."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And after that, there ought to be a simple, hard rule: Anyone who can work must go to work."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If a parent isn't paying child support, they should be forced to pay."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We should suspend drivers' license, track them across State lines, make them work off what they owe."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That is what we should do.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Governments do not raise children, people do."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And the parents must take responsibility for the children they bring into this world.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to work with you, with all of you, to pass welfare reform."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But our goal must be to liberate people and lift them up from dependence to independence, from welfare to work, from mere childbearing to responsible parenting."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our goal should not be to punish them because they happen to be poor.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We should, we should require work and mutual responsibility."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But we shouldn't cut people off just because they're poor, they're young, or even because they're unmarried."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We should promote responsibility by requiring young mothers to live at home with their parents or in other supervised settings, by requiring them to finish school."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But we shouldn't put them and their children out on the street.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And I know all the arguments, pro and con, and I have read and thought about this for a long time."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I still don't think we can in good conscience punish poor children for the mistakes of their parents.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, every single survey shows that all the American people care about this without regard to party or race or region."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,So let this be the year we end welfare as we know it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But also let this be the year that we are all able to stop using this issue to divide America.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"No one is more eager to end welfare--[applause]--I may be the only President who has actually had the opportunity to sit in a welfare office, who's actually spent hours and hours talking to people on welfare."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And I am telling you, the people who are trapped on it know it doesn't work; they also want to get off."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"So we can promote, together, education and work and good parenting."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I have no problem with punishing bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I just don't want to punish poverty and past mistakes.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"All of us have made our mistakes, and none of us can change our yesterdays."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But every one of us can change our tomorrows.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And America's best example of that may be Lynn Woolsey, who worked her way off welfare to become a Congresswoman from the State of California."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know the Members of this Congress are concerned about crime, as are all the citizens of our country."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And I remind you that last year we passed a very tough crime bill: longer sentences, ""three strikes and you're out,"" almost 60 new capital punishment offenses, more prisons, more prevention, 100,000 more police."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we paid for it all by reducing the size of the Federal bureaucracy and giving the money back to local communities to lower the crime rate.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"There may be other things we can do to be tougher on crime, to be smarter with crime, to help to lower that rate first."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, if there are, let's talk about them, and let's do them."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But let's not go back on the things that we did last year that we know work, that we know work because the local law enforcement officers tell us that we did the right thing, because local community leaders who have worked for years and years to lower the crime rate tell us that they work."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Let's look at the experience of our cities and our rural areas where the crime rate has gone down and ask the people who did it how they did it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And if what we did last year supports the decline in the crime rate--and I am convinced that it does--let us not go back on it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's stick with it, implement it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We've got 4 more hard years of work to do to do that.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I don't want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight, but I have to mention one issue that divided this body greatly last year."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The last Congress also passed the Brady bill and, in the crime bill, the ban on 19 assault weapons."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I don't think it's a secret to anybody in this room that several Members of the last Congress who voted for that aren't here tonight because they voted for it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And I know, therefore, that some of you who are here because they voted for it are under enormous pressure to repeal it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I just have to tell you how I feel about it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The Members of Congress who voted for that bill and I would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arms to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activities.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I've done it since I was a boy, and I'm going to keep right on doing it until I can't do it anymore."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But a lot of people laid down their seats in Congress so that police officers and kids wouldn't have to lay down their lives under a hail of assault weapon attack, and I will not let that be repealed."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I will not let it be repealed.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to talk about a couple of other issues we have to deal with.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I want us to cut more spending, but I hope we won't cut Government programs that help to prepare us for the new economy, promote responsibility, and are organized from the grassroots up, not by Federal bureaucracy."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The very best example of this is the national service corps, AmeriCorps."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It passed with strong bipartisan support.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And now there are 20,000 Americans, more than ever served in one year in the Peace Corps, working all over this country, helping people person-to- person in local grassroots volunteer groups, solving problems, and in the process earning some money for their education."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,This is citizenship at its best.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"It's good for the AmeriCorps members, but it's good for the rest of us, too."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"It's the essence of the New Covenant, and we shouldn't stop it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We are a nation of immigrants.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But we are also a nation of laws.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The most important job of our Government in this new era is to empower the American people to succeed in the global economy.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"America has always been a land of opportunity, a land where, if you work hard, you can get ahead."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We've become a great middle class country.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Middle class values sustain us.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass, even as we do everything we can to support the millions of Americans who are already successful in the new economy."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"America is once again the world's strongest economic power: almost 6 million new jobs in the last 2 years, exports booming, inflation down."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,High-wage jobs are coming back.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,A record number of American entrepreneurs are living the American dream.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If we want it to stay that way, those who work and lift our Nation must have more of its benefits."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, too many of those people are being left out."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,They're working harder for less.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"They have less security, less income, less certainty that they can even afford a vacation, much less college for their kids or retirement for themselves."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot let this continue.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If we don't act, our economy will probably keep doing what it's been doing since about 1978, when the income growth began to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle got very little growth, and people who worked like crazy but were on the bottom then fell even further and further behind in the years afterward, no matter how hard they worked."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We've got to have a Government that can be a real partner in making this new economy work for all of our people, a Government that helps each and every one of us to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skills."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why we worked so hard to increase educational opportunities in the last 2 years, from Head Start to public schools, to apprenticeships for young people who don't go to college, to making college loans more available and more affordable."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That's the first thing we have to do.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We've got to do something to empower people to improve their skills.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The second thing we ought to do is to help people raise their incomes immediately by lowering their taxes.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We took the first step in 1993 with a working family tax cut for 15 million families with incomes under $27,000, a tax cut that this year will average about $1,000 a family."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we also gave tax reductions to most small and new businesses.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Before we could do more than that, we first had to bring down the deficit we inherited, and we had to get economic growth up."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Now we've done both.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And now we can cut taxes in a more comprehensive way.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But tax cuts should reinforce and promote our first obligation: to empower our citizens through education and training to make the most of their own lives.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The spotlight should shine on those who make the right choices for themselves, their families, and their communities."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I have proposed the middle class bill of rights, which should properly be called the bill of rights and responsibilities because its provisions only benefit those who are working to educate and raise their children and to educate themselves."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"It will, therefore, give needed tax relief and raise incomes in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefits all of us."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,There are four provisions.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"First, a tax deduction for all education and training after high school."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If you think about it, we permit businesses to deduct their investment, we permit individuals to deduct interest on their home mortgages, but today an education is even more important to the economic well-being of our whole country than even those things are."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We should do everything we can to encourage it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And I hope you will support it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, we ought to cut taxes $500 for families with children under 13."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Third, we ought to foster more savings and personal responsibility by permitting people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education, health care, first-time homebuying, or the care of a parent."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And fourth, we should pass a GI bill for America's workers."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We propose to collapse nearly 70 Federal programs and not give the money to the States but give the money directly to the American people, offer vouchers to them so that they, if they're laid off or if they're working for a very low wage, can get a voucher worth $2,600 a year for up to 2 years to go to their local community colleges or wherever else they want to get the skills they need to improve their lives."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's empower people in this way, move it from the Government directly to the workers of America."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, any one of us can call for a tax cut, but I won't accept one that explodes the deficit or puts our recovery at risk."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We ought to pay for our tax cuts fully and honestly.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Just 2 years ago, it was an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to the courage of the people who were here then, many of whom didn't return, we did cut the deficit."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We began to do what others said would not be done.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We cut the deficit by over $600 billion, about $10,000 for every family in this country."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It's coming down 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Truman was President, and I don't think anybody in America wants us to let it explode again."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In the budget I will send you, the middle class bill of rights is fully paid for by budget cuts in bureaucracy, cuts in programs, cuts in special interest subsidies."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And the spending cuts will more than double the tax cuts.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,My budget pays for the middle class bill of rights without any cuts in Medicare.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And I will oppose any attempts to pay for tax cuts with Medicare cuts.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That's not the right thing to do.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know that a lot of you have your own ideas about tax relief, and some of them I find quite interesting."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I really want to work with all of you.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,My test for our proposals will be: Will it create jobs and raise incomes; will it strengthen our families and support our children; is it paid for; will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass?
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If it does, I'll support it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But if it doesn't, I won't."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The goal of building the middle class and shrinking the underclass is also why I believe that you should raise the minimum wage.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It rewards work.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Two and a half million Americans, two and a half million Americans, often women with children, are working out there today for $4.25 an hour."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, I've studied the arguments and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I believe the weight of the evidence is that a modest increase does not cost jobs and may even lure people back into the job market.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But the most important thing is, you can't make a living on $4.25 an hour, especially if you have children, even with the working families tax cut we passed last year."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In the past, the minimum wage has been a bipartisan issue, and I think it should be again."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"So I want to challenge you to have honest hearings on this, to get together, to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Members of Congress have been here less than a month, but by the end of the week, 28 days into the new year, every Member of Congress will have earned as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker makes all year long."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Everybody else here, including the President, has something else that too many Americans do without, and that's health care."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, last year we almost came to blows over health care, but we didn't do anything."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And the cold, hard fact is that, since last year, since I was here, another 1.1 million Americans in working families have lost their health care."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And the cold, hard fact is that many millions more, most of them farmers and small business people and self-employed people, have seen their premiums skyrocket, their copays and deductibles go up."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,There's a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistics have health insurance but really what they've got is a piece of paper that says they won't lose their home if they get sick.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, I still believe our country has got to move toward providing health security for every American family."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But I know that last year, as the evidence indicates, we bit off more than we could chew."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,So I'm asking you that we work together.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Let's do it step by step.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Let's do whatever we have to do to get something done.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no American risks losing coverage for facing skyrocketing prices, that nobody loses their coverage because they face high prices or unavailable insurance when they change jobs or lose a job or a family member gets sick."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this, with the Democrats who worked on it last time, with the Republican leaders like Senator Dole, who has a longtime commitment to health care reform and made some constructive proposals in this area last year."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We ought to make sure that self-employed people in small businesses can buy insurance at more affordable rates through voluntary purchasing pools.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We ought to help families provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We can work to help workers who lose their jobs at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And we can find a way--it may take some time, but we can find a way--to make sure that our children have health care."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, I think everybody in this room, without regard to party, can be proud of the fact that our country was rated as having the world's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But we can't be proud of the fact that we're the only wealthy country in the world that has a smaller percentage of the work force and their children with health insurance today than we did 10 years ago, the last time we were the most productive economy in the world."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,So let's work together on this.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It is too important for politics as usual.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Much of what the American people are thinking about tonight is what we've already talked about.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,A lot of people think that the security concerns of America today are entirely internal to our borders.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"They relate to the security of our jobs and our homes and our incomes and our children, our streets, our health, and protecting those borders."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now that the cold war has passed, it's tempting to believe that all the security issues, with the possible exception of trade, reside here at home."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But it's not so.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Our security still depends upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We still can't be strong at home unless we're strong abroad.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,The financial crisis in Mexico is a case in point.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know it's not popular to say it tonight, but we have to act, not for the Mexican people but for the sake of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods are tied to Mexico's well-being."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If we want to secure American jobs, preserve American exports, safeguard America's borders, then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put Mexico back on track."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Now let me repeat: It's not a loan; it's not foreign aid; it's not a bailout.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We will be given a guarantee like cosigning a note, with good collateral that will cover our risks."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,This legislation is the right thing for America.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That's why the bipartisan leadership has supported it.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And I hope you in Congress will pass it quickly.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"It is in our interest, and we can explain it to the American people because we're going to do it in the right way."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, tonight, this is the first State of the Union Address ever delivered since the beginning of the cold war when not a single Russian missile is pointed at the children of America."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And along with the Russians, we're on our way to destroying the missiles and the bombers that carry 9,000 nuclear warheads."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We've come so far so fast in this post-cold-war world that it's easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for granted.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But it's still there, and we aren't finished yet."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"This year I'll ask the Senate to approve START II to eliminate weapons that carry 5,000 more warheads."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The United States will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and to eliminate chemical weapons."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"To stop and roll back North Korea's potentially deadly nuclear program, we'll continue to implement the agreement we have reached with that nation."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It's smart.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It's tough.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It's a deal based on continuing inspection with safeguards for our allies and ourselves.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"This year I'll submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"As the cowards who bombed the World Trade Center found out, this country will hunt down terrorists and bring them to justice."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Just this week, another horrendous terrorist act in Israel killed 19 and injured scores more."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"On behalf of the American people and all of you, I send our deepest sympathy to the families of the victims."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know that in the face of such evil, it is hard for the people in the Middle East to go forward."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But the terrorists represent the past, not the future."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between Israel and all her neighbors in the Middle East.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Accordingly, last night I signed an Executive order that will block the assets in the United States of terrorist organizations that threaten to disrupt the peace process."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It prohibits financial transactions with these groups.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And tonight I call on all our allies and peace-loving nations throughout the world to join us with renewed fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot permit the future to be marred by terror and fear and paralysis.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"From the day I took the oath of office, I pledged that our Nation would maintain the best equipped, best trained, and best prepared military on Earth."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We have, and they are."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,They have managed the dramatic downsizing of our forces after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But to make sure our military is ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their families deserve, I'm asking the Congress to add $25 billion in defense spending over the next 6 years."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I have visited many bases at home and around the world since I became President.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I repeat that request with renewed conviction.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We ask a very great deal of our Armed Forces.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Now that they are smaller in number, we ask more of them."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,They go out more often to more different places and stay longer.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"They are called to service in many, many ways."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And we must give them and their families what the times demand and what they have earned.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Just think about what our troops have done in the last year, showing America at its best, helping to save hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda, moving with lightning speed to head off another threat to Kuwait, giving freedom and democracy back to the people of Haiti."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We have proudly supported peace and prosperity and freedom from South Africa to Northern Ireland, from Central and Eastern Europe to Asia, from Latin America to the Middle East."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"All these endeavors are good in those places, but they make our future more confident and more secure."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, my fellow Americans, that's my agenda for America's future: expanding opportunity, not bureaucracy; enhancing security at home and abroad; empowering our people to make the most of their own lives."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"It's ambitious and achievable, but it's not enough."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We even need more than new ideas for changing the world or equipping Americans to compete in the new economy, more than a Government that's smaller, smarter, and wiser, more than all of the changes we can make in Government and in the private sector from the outside in."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Our fortunes and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some questions from within, from the values and voices that speak to our hearts as well as our heads; voices that tell us we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our families, for our communities, and yes, for our fellow citizens."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We see our families and our communities all over this country coming apart, and we feel the common ground shifting from under us."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The PTA, the town hall meeting, the ball park, it's hard for a lot of overworked parents to find the time and space for those things that strengthen the bonds of trust and cooperation."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Too many of our children don't even have parents and grandparents who can give them those experiences that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We all know what while we here in this Chamber can make a difference on those things, that the real differences will be made by our fellow citizens, where they work and where they live and that it will be made almost without regard to party."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"When I used to go to the softball park in Little Rock to watch my daughter's league, and people would come up to me, fathers and mothers, and talk to me, I can honestly say I had no idea whether 90 percent of them were Republicans or Democrats."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"When I visited the relief centers after the floods in California, northern California, last week, a woman came up to me and did something that very few of you would do."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"She hugged me and said, ""Mr."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"President, I'm a Republican, but I'm glad you're here."" [Laughter] Now, why?"
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We can't wait for disasters to act the way we used to act every day, because as we move into this next century, everybody matters."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,We don't have a person to waste.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And a lot of people are losing a lot of chances to do better.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That means that we need a New Covenant for everybody.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"For our corporate and business leaders, we're going to work here to keep bringing the deficit down, to expand markets, to support their success in every possible way."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But they have an obligation when they're doing well to keep jobs in our communities and give their workers a fair share of the prosperity they generate.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"For people in the entertainment industry in this country, we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success, and we support your freedom of expression."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that comes from the incessant, repetitive, mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeates our media all the time."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We've got to ask our community leaders and all kinds of organizations to help us stop our most serious social problem, the epidemic of teen pregnancies and births where there is no marriage."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I have sent to Congress a plan to target schools all over this country with antipregnancy programs that work.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But Government can only do so much.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I call on parents and leaders all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We can do this, and we must."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And I would like to say a special word to our religious leaders.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, I'm proud of the fact the United States has more houses of worship per capita than any country in the world."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"These people who lead our houses of worship can ignite their congregations to carry their faith into action, can reach out to all of our children, to all of the people in distress, to those who have been savaged by the breakdown of all we hold dear."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Because so much of what must be done must come from the inside out and our religious leaders and their congregations can make all the difference, they have a role in the New Covenant as well."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,There must be more responsibility for all of our citizens.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, it takes a lot of people to help all the kids in trouble stay off the streets and in school."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It takes a lot of people to build the Habitat for Humanity houses that the Speaker celebrates on his lapel pin.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It takes a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organizations in this country that made our communities mean so much to most of us when we were kids.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It takes every parent to teach the children the difference between right and wrong and to encourage them to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong things but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I know it's hard when you're working harder for less, when you're under great stress to do these things."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"A lot of our people don't have the time or the emotional stress, they think, to do the work of citizenship."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Most of us in politics haven't helped very much.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"For years, we've mostly treated citizens like they were consumers or spectators, sort of political couch potatoes who were supposed to watch the TV ads either promise them something for nothing or play on their fears and frustrations."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And more and more of our citizens now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive ways that are hardly conducive to honest and open conversations.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But the truth is, we have got to stop seeing each other as enemies just because we have different views."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"If you go back to the beginning of this country, the great strength of America, as de Tocqueville pointed out when he came here a long time ago, has always been our ability to associate with people who were different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And in this day, everybody has a responsibility to do more of that."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We simply cannot want for a tornado, a fire, or a flood to behave like Americans ought to behave in dealing with one another."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I want to finish up here by pointing out some folks that are up with the First Lady that represent what I'm trying to talk about--citizens.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I have no idea what their party affiliation is or who they voted for in the last election.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,But they represent what we ought to be doing.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Cindy Perry teaches second graders to read in AmeriCorps in rural Kentucky.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,She gains when she gives.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,She's a mother of four.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,She says that her service inspired her to get her high school equivalency last year.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"She was married when she was a teenager--stand up, Cindy."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,She was married when she was a teenager.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,She had four children.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"But she had time to serve other people, to get her high school equivalency, and she's going to use her AmeriCorps money to go back to college."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Chief Stephen Bishop is the police chief of Kansas City.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"He's been a national leader--stand up, Steve."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"He's been a national leader in using more police in community policing, and he's worked with AmeriCorps to do it."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And the crime rate in Kansas City has gone down as a result of what he did.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Corporal Gregory Depestre went to Haiti as part of his adopted country's force to help secure democracy in his native land.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And I might add, we must be the only country in the world that could have gone to Haiti and taken Haitian-Americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"And he was one of them, and we're proud of him."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The next two folks I've had the honor of meeting and getting to know a little bit, the Reverend John and the Reverend Diana Cherry of the AME Zion Church in Temple Hills, Maryland."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to ask them to stand.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,I want to tell you about them.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In the early eighties, they left Government service and formed a church in a small living room in a small house, in the early eighties."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Today that church has 17,000 members."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It is one of the three or four biggest churches in the entire United States.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,It grows by 200 a month.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,They do it together.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And the special focus of their ministry is keeping families together.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Two things they did make a big impression on me.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I visited their church once, and I learned they were building a new sanctuary closer to the Washington, DC, line in a higher crime, higher drug rate area because they thought it was part of their ministry to change the lives of the people who needed them."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The second thing I want to say is that once Reverend Cherry was at a meeting at the White House with some other religious leaders, and he left early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couples that he had brought back to his church from all over America to convince them to come back together, to save their marriages, and to raise their kids."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,This is the kind of work that citizens are doing in America.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"We need more of it, and it ought to be lifted up and supported."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"The last person I want to introduce is Jack Lucas from Hattiesburg, Mississippi."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Jack, would you stand up?"
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Fifty years ago, in the sands of Iwo Jima, Jack Lucas taught and learned the lessons of citizenship."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"On February 20th, 1945, he and three of his buddies encountered the enemy and two grenades at their feet."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,Jack Lucas threw himself on both of them.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"In that moment, he saved the lives of his companions, and miraculously in the next instant, a medic saved his life."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today--and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran--at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"All these years later, yesterday, here's what he said about that day: ""It didn't matter where you were from or who you were, you relied on one another."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"You did it for your country."" We all gain when we give, and we reap what we sow."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,That's at the heart of this New Covenant.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Responsibility, opportunity, and citizenship, more than stale chapters in some remote civic book, they're still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our God- given potential and be like them and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country, the enduring dream from that first and most sacred covenant."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe every person in this country still believes that we are created equal and given by our Creator the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"This is a very, very great country."
1995,Clinton,Democratic,And our best days are still to come.
1995,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, and God bless you all."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 23, 1996 Thank you very much."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Mr.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of the 104th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans all across our land: Let me begin tonight by saying to our men and women in uniform around the world, and especially those helping peace take root in Bosnia and to their families, I thank you."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"America is very, very proud of you."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"My duty tonight is to report on the state of the Union, not the state of our Government but of our American community, and to set forth our responsibilities, in the words of our Founders, to form a more perfect Union."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The state of the Union is strong.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our economy is the healthiest it has been in three decades.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We have the lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation in 27 years.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We have completed--created nearly 8 million new jobs, over a million of them in basic industries like construction and automobiles."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,America is selling more cars than Japan for the first time since the 1970's.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And for 3 years in a row, we have had a record number of new businesses started in our country."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Our leadership in the world is also strong, bringing hope for new peace."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And perhaps most important, we are gaining ground in restoring our fundamental values."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"The crime rate, the welfare and food stamp rolls, the poverty rate, and the teen pregnancy rate are all down."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And as they go down, prospects for America's future go up."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We live in an age of possibility.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we move to an age of technology, information, and global competition."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"These changes have opened vast new opportunities for our people, but they have also presented them with stiff challenges."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"While more Americans are living better, too many of our fellow citizens are working harder just to keep up, and they are rightly concerned about the security of their families."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We must answer here three fundamental questions: First, how do we make the American dream of opportunity for all a reality for all Americans who are willing to work for it?"
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, how do we preserve our old and enduring values as we move into the future?"
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And third, how do we meet these challenges together, as one America?"
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We know big Government does not have all the answers.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We know there's not a program for every problem.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We know, and we have worked to give the American people a smaller, less bureaucratic Government in Washington."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And we have to give the American people one that lives within its means.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The era of big Government is over.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we cannot go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Instead, we must go forward as one America, one nation working together to meet the challenges we face together."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Self-reliance and teamwork are not opposing virtues; we must have both.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe our new, smaller Government must work in an old-fashioned American way, together with all of our citizens through State and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable, and civic associations."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own lives, with stronger families, more educational opportunity, economic security, safer streets, a cleaner environment in a safer world."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"To improve the state of our Union, we must ask more of ourselves, we must expect more of each other, and we must face our challenges together."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Here, in this place, our responsibility begins with balancing the budget in a way that is fair to all Americans."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,There is now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I compliment the Republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have brought to this task of balancing the budget.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And I thank the Democrats for passing the largest deficit reduction plan in history in 1993, which has already cut the deficit nearly in half in 3 years."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Since 1993, we have all begun to see the benefits of deficit reduction."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Lower interest rates have made it easier for businesses to borrow and to invest and to create new jobs.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Lower interest rates have brought down the cost of home mortgages, car payments, and credit card rates to ordinary citizens."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, it is time to finish the job and balance the budget."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Though differences remain among us which are significant, the combined total of the proposed savings that are common to both plans is more than enough, using the numbers from your Congressional Budget Office to balance the budget in 7 years and to provide a modest tax cut."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,These cuts are real.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,They will require sacrifice from everyone.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But these cuts do not undermine our fundamental obligations to our parents, our children, and our future, by endangering Medicare or Medicaid or education or the environment or by raising taxes on working families."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I have said before, and let me say again, many good ideas have come out of our negotiations."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I have learned a lot about the way both Republicans and Democrats view the debate before us.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I have learned a lot about the good ideas that each side has that we could all embrace.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We ought to resolve our remaining differences.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I am willing to work to resolve them.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I am ready to meet tomorrow.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But I ask you to consider that we should at least enact these savings that both plans have in common and give the American people their balanced budget, a tax cut, lower interest rates, and a brighter future."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We should do that now and make permanent deficits yesterday's legacy.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Now it is time for us to look also to the challenges of today and tomorrow, beyond the burdens of yesterday."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The challenges are significant.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But our Nation was built on challenges.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"America was built on challenges, not promises."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And when we work together to meet them, we never fail."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,That is the key to a more perfect Union.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our individual dreams must be realized by our common efforts.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I want to speak to you about the challenges we all face as a people.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our first challenge is to cherish our children and strengthen America's families.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Family is the foundation of American life.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"If we have stronger families, we will have a stronger America."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Before I go on, I'd like to take just a moment to thank my own family, and to thank the person who has taught me more than anyone else over 25 years about the importance of families and children, a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother, and a great First Lady."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, Hillary."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,All strong families begin with taking more responsibility for our children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I've heard Mrs.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Gore say that it's hard to be a parent today, but it's even harder to be a child."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"So all of us, not just as parents but all of us in our other roles--our media, our schools, our teachers, our communities, our churches and synagogues, our businesses, our governments--all of us have a responsibility to help our children to make it and to make the most of their lives and their God-given capacities."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"To the media, I say you should create movies and CD's and television shows you'd want your own children and grandchildren to enjoy."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I call on Congress to pass the requirement for a V-chip in TV sets so that parents can screen out programs they believe are inappropriate for their children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"When parents control what their young children see, that is not censorship; that is enabling parents to assume more personal responsibility for their children's upbringing."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I urge them to do it.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The V-chip requirement is part of the important telecommunications bill now pending in this Congress.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"It has bipartisan support, and I urge you to pass it now."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"To make the V-chip work, I challenge the broadcast industry to do what movies have done, to identify your program in ways that help parents to protect their children."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I invite the leaders of major media corporations in the entertainment industry to come to the White House next month to work with us in a positive way on concrete ways to improve what our children see on television.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I am ready to work with you.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I say to those who make and market cigarettes, every year a million children take up smoking, even though it's against the law."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Three hundred thousand of them will have their lives shortened as a result.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our administration has taken steps to stop the massive marketing campaigns that appeal to our children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We are simply saying: Market your products to adults, if you wish, but draw the line on children."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I say to those who are on welfare, and especially to those who have been trapped on welfare for a long time: For too long our welfare system has undermined the values of family and work, instead of supporting them."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The Congress and I are near agreement on sweeping welfare reform.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We agree on time limits, tough work requirements, and the toughest possible child support enforcement."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But I believe we must also provide child care so that mothers who are required to go to work can do so without worrying about what is happening to their children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge this Congress to send me a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I will sign it immediately.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Let us be candid about this difficult problem.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Passing a law, even the best possible law, is only a first step."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The next step is to make it work.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge American businesses to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I applaud the work of religious groups and others who care for the poor.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"More than anyone else in our society, they know the true difficulty of the task before us, and they are in a position to help."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Every one of us should join them.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,That is the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American people.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,To strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate going down.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I am gratified, as I'm sure all Americans are, that it has dropped for 2 years in a row."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we all know it is still far too high.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I am pleased to announce that a group of prominent Americans is responding to that challenge by forming an organization that will support grassroots community efforts all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I challenge all of us and every American to join their efforts.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I call on American men and women in families to give greater respect to one another.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I challenge America's families to work harder to stay together.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"For families who stay together not only do better economically, their children do better as well."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"If your family has separated, you must pay your child support."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We're doing more than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to do more."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But let's all admit something about that, too: A check will not substitute for a parent's love and guidance."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And only you--only you can make the decision to help raise your children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"No matter who you are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our second challenge is to provide Americans with the educational opportunities we'll all need for this new century.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"In our schools, every classroom in America must be connected to the information superhighway, with computers and good software and well-trained teachers."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We are working with the telecommunications industry, educators, and parents to connect 20 percent of California's classrooms by this spring, and every classroom and every library in the entire United States by the year 2000."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I ask Congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeeds.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Every diploma ought to mean something.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge every community, every school, and every State to adopt national standards of excellence, to measure whether schools are meeting those standards, to cut bureaucratic redtape so that schools and teachers have more flexibility for grassroots reform, and to hold them accountable for results."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,That's what our Goals 2000 initiative is all about.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge every State to give all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend, and to let teachers form new schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge all our schools to teach character education, to teach good values and good citizenship."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And if it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear school uniforms."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge our parents to become their children's first teachers.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Turn off the TV.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,See that the homework is done.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And visit your children's classroom.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"No program, no teacher, no one else can do that for you."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, higher education is more important today than ever before."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We've created a new student loan program that's made it easier to borrow and repay those loans, and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,That's something we should all be proud of because it was unconscionably high just a few years ago.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Through AmeriCorps, our national service program, this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serving their local communities to improve the lives of their friends and neighbors."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"These initiatives are right for America, and we should keep them going."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And we should also work hard to open the doors of college even wider.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge Congress to expand work-study and help one million young Americans work their way through college by the year 2000, to provide a $1,000 merit scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school in the United States, to expand Pell Grant scholarships for deserving and needy students, and to make up to $10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,It's a good idea for America.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Our third challenge is to help every American who is willing to work for it, achieve economic security in this new age."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,People who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,They need education and training for a lifetime.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,They need more support for families raising children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,They need retirement security.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,They need access to health care.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,More and more Americans are finding that the education of their childhood simply doesn't last a lifetime.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"So I challenge Congress to consolidate 70 overlapping, antiquated job-training programs into a simple voucher worth $2,600 for unemployed or underemployed workers to use as they please for community college tuition or other training."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"This is a ""GI bill"" for America's workers we should all be able to agree on."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,More and more Americans are working hard without a raise.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Congress sets the minimum wage.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Within a year, the minimum wage will fall to a 40-year low in purchasing power."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Four dollars and 25 cents an hour is no longer a minimum wage, but millions of Americans and their children are trying to live on it."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge you to raise their minimum wage.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"In 1993, Congress cut the taxes of 15 million hard-pressed working families to make sure that no parents who work full-time would have to raise their children in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"This expanded earned-income tax credit is now worth about $1,800 a year to a family of four living on $20,000."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The budget bill I vetoed would have reversed this achievement and raised taxes on nearly 8 million of these people.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We should not do that.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We should not do that.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I also agree that the people who are helped under this initiative are not all those in our country who are working hard to do a good job raising their children and at work.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I agree that we need a tax credit for working families with children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"That's one of the things most of us in this Chamber, I hope, can agree on."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I know it is strongly supported by the Republican majority.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And it should be part of any final budget agreement.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pensions for your employees.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I challenge Congress to pass a proposal recommended by the White House Conference on Small Business that would make it easier for small businesses and farmers to establish their own pension plans.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,That is something we should all agree on.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We should also protect existing pension plans.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Two years ago, with bipartisan support that was almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle, we moved to protect the pensions of 8 million working people and to stabilize the pensions of 32 million more."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Congress should not now let companies endanger those workers' pension funds.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employers to take money out of pension funds for other purposes would raise money for the Treasury.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But I believe it is false economy.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I vetoed that proposal last year, and I would have to do so again."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, if our working families are going to succeed in the new economy, they must be able to buy health insurance policies that they do not lose when they change jobs or when someone in their family gets sick."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Over the past 2 years, over one million Americans in working families have lost their health insurance."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We have to do more to make health care available to every American.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum that would require insurance companies to stop dropping people when they switch jobs and stop denying coverage for preexisting conditions.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Let's all do that.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And even as we enact savings in these programs, we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protections of Medicare and Medicaid, not just to the poor but to people in working families, including children, people with disabilities, people with AIDS, senior citizens in nursing homes."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"In the past 3 years, we've saved $15 billion just by fighting health care fraud and abuse."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We have all agreed to save much more.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We have all agreed to stabilize the Medicare Trust Fund.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we must not abandon our fundamental obligations to the people who need Medicare and Medicaid.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,America cannot become stronger if they become weaker.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"The ""GI bill"" for workers, tax relief for education and child rearing, pension availability and protection, access to health care, preservation of Medicare and Medicaid, these things, along with the Family and Medical Leave Act passed in 1993, these things will help responsible, hard-working American families to make the most of their own lives."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But employers and employees must do their part, as well, as they are doing in so many of our finest companies, working together, putting the long-term prosperity ahead of the short-term gain."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"As workers increase their hours and their productivity, employers should make sure they get the skills they need and share the benefits of the good years, as well as the burdens of the bad ones."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"When companies and workers work as a team they do better, and so does America."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our fourth great challenge is to take our streets back from crime and gangs and drugs.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"At last we have begun to find a way to reduce crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch criminals and prevent crime."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"This strategy, called community policing, is clearly working."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Violent crime is coming down all across America.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"In New York City murders are down 25 percent, in St."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Louis, 18 percent, in Seattle, 32 percent."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we still have a long way to go before our streets are safe and our people are free from fear.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The crime bill of 1994 is critical to the success of community policing.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"It provides funds for 100,000 new police in communities of all sizes."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We're already a third of the way there.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I challenge the Congress to finish the job.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Let us stick with a strategy that's working and keep the crime rate coming down.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Community policing also requires bonds of trust between citizens and police.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I ask all Americans to respect and support our law enforcement officers.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And to our police, I say, our children need you as role models and heroes."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Don't let them down.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"The Brady bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records from buying guns."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The assault weapons ban is keeping 19 kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge the Congress to keep those laws on the books.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our next step in the fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the mob.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I'm directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that involve juveniles and violent crime, and to seek authority to prosecute as adults teenagers who maim and kill like adults."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I challenge local housing authorities and tenant associations: Criminal gang members and drug dealers are destroying the lives of decent tenants.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and pedal drugs should be one strike and you're out."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge every State to match Federal policy to assure that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"More police and punishment are important, but they're not enough."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We have got to keep more of our young people out of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington but developed in communities."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge all of our communities, all of our adults, to give our children futures to say yes to."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And I challenge Congress not to abandon the crime bill's support of these grassroots prevention efforts.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their children openly and firmly."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"It embraces our churches and synagogues, our youth groups and our schools."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge Congress not to cut our support for drug-free schools.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,People like the D.A.R.E. officers are making a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give them the strength to say no when the time comes.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to cut the flow of drugs into America."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"For the last 2 years, one man in particular has been on the front lines of that effort."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I am nominating him, a hero of the Persian Gulf War and the Commander in Chief of the United States Military Southern Command, General Barry McCaffrey, as America's new drug czar."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,General McCaffrey has earned three Purple Hearts and two Silver Stars fighting for this country.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I ask that he lead our Nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,He needs all of us.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Every one of us has a role to play on this team.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one more time."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our fifth challenge: to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have cleaner water and air, lead levels in children's blood has been cut by 70 percent, toxic emissions from factories cut in half."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Lake Erie was dead, and now it's a thriving resource."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But 10 million children under 12 still live within 4 miles of a toxic waste dump.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,A third of us breathe air that endangers our health.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And in too many communities the water is not safe to drink.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We still have much to do.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Yet Congress has voted to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"That means more toxic chemicals in our water, more smog in our air, more pesticides in our food."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Lobbyists for polluters have been allowed to write their own loopholes into bills to weaken laws that protect the health and safety of our children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluters who can afford to fix it off the hook.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I challenge Congress to reexamine those policies and to reverse them.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,This issue has not been a partisan issue.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The most significant environmental gains in the last 30 years were made under a Democratic Congress and President Richard Nixon.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We can work together.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We have to believe some basic things.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Do you believe we can expand the economy without hurting the environment?
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I do.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Do you believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment up?
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I know we can.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,That should be our commitment.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We must challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we have to make it easier for them to do it."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"To businesses this administration is saying: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than Government regulations require to meet tough pollution standards, do it, as long as you do it right."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"To communities we say: We must strengthen community right-to-know laws requiring polluters to disclose their emissions, but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,People do have a right to know that their air and their water are safe.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our sixth challenge is to maintain America's leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Because of American leadership, more people than ever before live free and at peace."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And Americans have known 50 years of prosperity and security.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We owe thanks especially to our veterans of World War II.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I would like to say to Senator Bob Dole and to all others in this Chamber who fought in World War II, and to all others on both sides of the aisle who have fought bravely in all our conflicts since: I salute your service and so do the American people."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"All over the world, even after the cold war, people still look to us and trust us to help them seek the blessings of peace and freedom."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But as the cold war fades into memory, voices of isolation say America should retreat from its responsibilities."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I say they are wrong.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The threats we face today as Americans respect no Nation's borders.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Think of them: terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, drug trafficking, ethnic and religious hatred, aggression by rogue states, environmental degradation."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"If we fail to address these threats today, we will suffer the consequences in all our tomorrows."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, we can't be everywhere."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, we can't do everything."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But where our interests and our values are at stake, and where we can make a difference, America must lead."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We must not be isolationist.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We must not be the world's policeman.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we can and should be the world's very best peacemaker.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"By keeping our military strong, by using diplomacy where we can and force where we must, by working with others to share the risk and the cost of our efforts, America is making a difference for people here and around the world."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,For the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age-- for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age--there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,North Korea has now frozen its dangerous nuclear weapons program.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"In Haiti, the dictators are gone, democracy has a new day, the flow of desperate refugees to our shores has subsided."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Through tougher trade deals for America, over 80 of them, we have opened markets abroad, and now exports are at an all-time high, growing faster than imports and creating good American jobs."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We stood with those taking risks for peace: in Northern Ireland, where Catholic and Protestant children now tell their parents, violence must never return; in the Middle East, where Arabs and Jews who once seemed destined to fight forever now share knowledge and resources and even dreams."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And we stood up for peace in Bosnia.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Remember the skeletal prisoners, the mass graves, the campaign to rape and torture, the endless lines of refugees, the threat of a spreading war."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"All these threats, all these horrors have now begun to give way to the promise of peace."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Now our troops and a strong NATO, together with our new partners from central Europe and elsewhere, are helping that peace to take hold."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"As all of you know, I was just there with a bipartisan congressional group, and I was so proud not only of what our troops were doing but of the pride they evidenced in what they were doing."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"They knew what America's mission in this world is, and they were proud to be carrying it out."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Through these efforts, we have enhanced the security of the American people, but make no mistake about it: Important challenges remain."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,The START II treaty with Russia will cut our nuclear stockpiles by another 25 percent.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I urge the Senate to ratify it now.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We must end the race to create new nuclear weapons by signing a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty this year.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"As we remember what happened in the Japanese subway, we can outlaw poison gas forever if the Senate ratifies the Chemical Weapons Convention this year."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We can intensify the fight against terrorists and organized criminals at home and abroad if Congress passes the antiterrorism legislation I proposed after the Oklahoma City bombing, now."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We can help more people move from hatred to hope all across the world in our own interest if Congress gives us the means to remain the world's leader for peace.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, the six challenges I have just discussed are for all of us."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our seventh challenge is really America's challenge to those of us in this hallowed Hall tonight: to reinvent our Government and make our democracy work for them.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Last year this Congress applied to itself the laws it applies to everyone else.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,This Congress banned gifts and meals from lobbyists.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,This Congress forced lobbyists to disclose who pays them and what legislation they are trying to pass or kill.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"This Congress did that, and I applaud you for it."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Now I challenge Congress to go further, to curb special interest influence in politics by passing the first truly bipartisan campaign finance reform bill in a generation."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"You, Republicans and Democrats alike, can show the American people that we can limit spending and we can open the airwaves to all candidates."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I also appeal to Congress to pass the line-item veto you promised the American people.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our administration is working hard to give the American people a Government that works better and costs less.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to the work of Vice President Gore, we are eliminating 16,000 pages of unnecessary rules and regulations, shifting more decisionmaking out of Washington, back to States and local communities."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"As we move into the era of balanced budgets and smaller Government, we must work in new ways to enable people to make the most of their own lives."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We are helping America's communities, not with more bureaucracy but with more opportunities."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Through our successful empowerment zones and community development banks, we're helping people to find jobs, to start businesses."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And with tax incentives for companies that clean up abandoned industrial property, we can bring jobs back to places that desperately, desperately need them."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But there are some areas that the Federal Government should not leave and should address and address strongly.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"After years of neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We are increasing border controls by 50 percent.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And tonight, I announce I will sign an Executive order to deny Federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Let me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to be a good citizen, working hard to become a new citizen."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we are also a nation of laws.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I want to say a special word now to those who work for our Federal Government.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Today the Federal work force is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Our Federal Government today is the smallest it has been in 30 years, and it's getting smaller every day."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Most of our fellow Americans probably don't know that.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,And there's a good reason--a good reason: The remaining Federal work force is composed of hard-working Americans who are now working harder and working smarter than ever before to make sure the quality of our services does not decline.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to give you one example.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,His name is Richard Dean.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,He's a 49-year-old Vietnam veteran who's worked for the Social Security Administration for 22 years now.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Last year he was hard at work in the Federal Building in Oklahoma City when the blast killed 169 people and brought the rubble down all around him.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,He reentered that building four times.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,He saved the lives of three women.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"He's here with us this evening, and I want to recognize Richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But Richard Dean's story doesn't end there.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"This last November, he was forced out of his office when the Government shut down."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And the second time the Government shut down he continued helping Social Security recipients, but he was working without pay."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"On behalf of Richard Dean and his family, and all the other people who are out there working every day doing a good job for the American people, I challenge all of you in this Chamber: Let's never, ever shut the Federal Government down again."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"On behalf of all Americans, especially those who need their Social Security payments at the beginning of March, I also challenge the Congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the United States, to honor the obligations of this great Nation as we have for 220 years, to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people America keeps its word."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I know that this evening I have asked a lot of Congress and even more from America.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But I am confident: When Americans work together in their homes, their schools, their churches, their synagogues, their civic groups, their workplace, they can meet any challenge."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"I say again, the era of big Government is over."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But we can't go back to the era of fending for yourself.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We have to go forward to the era of working together as a community, as a team, as one America, with all of us reaching across these lines that divide us--the division, the discrimination, the rancor--we have to reach across it to find common ground."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,We have got to work together if we want America to work.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,I want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Lucius Wright is a teacher in the Jackson, Mississippi, public school system."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"A Vietnam veteran, he has created groups to help inner-city children turn away from gangs and build futures they can believe in."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Sergeant Jennifer Rodgers is a police officer in Oklahoma City.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Like Richard Dean, she helped to pull her fellow citizens out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,She reminds us that in their response to that atrocity the people of Oklahoma City lifted all of us with their basic sense of decency and community.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Lucius Wright and Jennifer Rodgers are special Americans.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"And I have the honor to announce tonight that they are the very first of several thousand Americans who will be chosen to carry the Olympic torch on its long journey from Los Angeles to the centennial of the modern Olympics in Atlanta this summer, not because they are star athletes but because they are star citizens, community heroes meeting America's challenges."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,They are our real champions.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Please stand up. [Applause] Now each of us must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own lives.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,None of us can finish the race alone.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We can only achieve our destiny together, one hand, one generation, one American connecting to another."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"There have always been things we could do together, dreams we could make real which we could never have done on our own."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"We Americans have forged our identity, our very Union, from the very point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet, every different opinion."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"But we must be bound together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divides us, by our belief in progress, our love of liberty, and our relentless search for common ground."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,America has always sought and always risen to every challenge.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"Who would say that having come so far together, we will not go forward from here?"
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Who would say that this age of possibility is not for all Americans?
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Our country is and always has been a great and good nation.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,But the best is yet to come if we all do our parts.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Thank you.
1996,Clinton,Democratic,"God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
1996,Clinton,Democratic,Thank you.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION February 4, 1997 Mr."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I think I should start by saying, thanks for inviting me back."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime history and a plan of action to meet that challenge, to prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We have much to be thankful for.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With four years of growth, we have won back the basic strength of our economy."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With crime and welfare rolls declining, we are winning back our optimism, the enduring faith that we can master any difficulty."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With the cold war receding and global commerce at record levels, we are helping to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all across the world."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, the state of our Union is strong."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"But now we must rise to the decisive moment, to make a nation and a world better than any we have ever known."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"The new promise of the global economy, the information age, unimagined new work, life-enhancing technology, all these are ours to seize."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That is our honor and our challenge.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must be shapers of events, not observers."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"For if we do not act, the moment will pass, and we will lose the best possibilities of our future."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We face no imminent threat, but we do have an enemy."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The enemy of our time is inaction.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"So tonight I issue a call to action: action by this Congress, action by our States, by our people, to prepare America for the 21st century; action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and working for all our people; action to strengthen education and harness the forces of technology and science; action to build stronger families and stronger communities and a safer environment; action to keep America the world's strongest force for peace, freedom, and prosperity; and above all, action to build a more perfect Union here at home."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must be committed to the pursuit of opportunity for all Americans, responsibility from all Americans, in a community of all Americans."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And we must be committed to a new kind of Government, not to solve all our problems for us but to give our people, all our people, the tools they need to make the most of their own lives."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And we must work together.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The people of this Nation elected us all.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"They want us to be partners, not partisans."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"They put us all right here in the same boat, they gave us all oars, and they told us to row."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, here is the direction I believe we should take."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"First, we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country, to balance the budget, renew our democracy, and finish the job of welfare reform."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Over the last four years, we have brought new economic growth by investing in our people, expanding our exports, cutting our deficits, creating over 11 million new jobs, a 4-year record."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now we must keep our economy the strongest in the world.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We here tonight have an historic opportunity.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Let this Congress be the Congress that finally balances the budget. [Applause] Thank you.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In 2 days, I will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"This plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protecting Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"It will balance the budget and build on the Vice President's efforts to make our Government work better, even as it costs less."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"It will balance the budget and provide middle class tax relief to pay for education and health care, to help to raise a child, to buy and sell a home."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my signature.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,It does not require us to rewrite our Constitution.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results, such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us at least agree, we should not pass any measure--no measure should be passed that threatens Social Security."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Whatever your view on that, we all must concede: We don't need a constitutional amendment; we need action."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Whatever our differences, we should balance the budget now."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And then, for the long-term health of our society, we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve Social Security and reform Medicare for the long run, so that these fundamental programs will be as strong for our children as they are for our parents."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And let me say something that's not in my script tonight.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I know this is not going to be easy.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But I really believe one of the reasons the American people gave me a second term was to take the tough decisions in the next 4 years that will carry our country through the next 50 years.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I know it is easier for me than for you to say or do.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"But another reason I was elected is to support all of you, without regard to party, to give you what is necessary to join in these decisions."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We owe it to our country and to our future.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Our second piece of unfinished business requires us to commit ourselves tonight, before the eyes of America, to finally enacting bipartisan campaign finance reform."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, Senators McCain and Feingold, Representatives Shays and Meehan, have reached across party lines here to craft tough and fair reform."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Their proposal would curb spending, reduce the role of special interests, create a level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and ban contributions from noncitizens, all corporate sources, and the other large soft money contributions that both parties receive."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,You know and I know that this can be delayed.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And you know and I know the delay will mean the death of reform.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,So let's set our own deadline.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass McCain-Feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy, July the Fourth."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,There is a third piece of unfinished business.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Over the last four years, we moved a record 2.25 million people off the welfare rolls."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Then last year, Congress enacted landmark welfare reform legislation, demanding that all able-bodied recipients assume the responsibility of moving from welfare to work."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility, indeed, our moral obligation, to make sure that people who now must work, can work."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now we must act to meet a new goal: 2 million more people off the welfare rolls by the year 2000.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Here is my plan: Tax credits and other incentives for businesses that hire people off welfare; incentives for job placement firms and States to create more jobs for welfare recipients; training, transportation, and child care to help people go to work."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now I challenge every State: Turn those welfare checks into private sector paychecks.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge every religious congregation, every community nonprofit, every business to hire someone off welfare."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And I'd like to say especially to every employer in our country who ever criticized the old welfare system, you can't blame that old system anymore."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We have torn it down.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now do your part.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Give someone on welfare the chance to go to work.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I am pleased to announce that five major corporations, Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines, will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We passed welfare reform.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,All of you know I believe we were right to do it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But no one can walk out of this Chamber with a clear conscience unless you are prepared to finish the job.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And we must join together to do something else, too, something both Republican and Democratic Governors have asked us to do, to restore basic health and disability benefits when misfortune strikes immigrants who came to this country legally, who work hard, pay taxes, and obey the law."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,To do otherwise is simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrants.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, looking ahead, the greatest step of all, the high threshold of the future we must now cross, and my number one priority for the next 4 years is to ensure that all Americans have the best education in the world."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Let's work together to meet these three goals: Every 8-year-old must be able to read; every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the Internet; every 18-year-old must be able to go to college; and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My balanced budget makes an unprecedented commitment to these goals, $51 billion next year."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But far more than money is required.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I have a plan, a call to action for American education, based on these 10 principles: First, a national crusade for education standards, not Federal Government standards but national standards, representing what all our students must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Every State and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standards and train teachers to lift students up to them.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To help schools meet the standards and measure their progress, we will lead an effort over the next 2 years to develop national tests of student achievement in reading and math."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I issue a challenge to the Nation: Every State should adopt high national standards, and by 1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading and every eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are met."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Raising standards will not be easy, and some of our children will not be able to meet them at first."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The point is not to put our children down but to lift them up.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Good tests will show us who needs help, what changes in teaching to make, and which schools need to improve."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"They can help us end social promotions, for no child should move from grade school to junior high or junior high to high school until he or she is ready."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Last month, our Secretary of Education Dick Riley and I visited Northern Illinois, where eighth grade students from 20 school districts, in a project aptly called First in the World, took the Third International Math and Science Study."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That's a test that reflects the world-class standards our children must meet for the new era.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And those students in Illinois tied for first in the world in science and came in second in math.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Two of them, Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsler, are here tonight, along with their teacher Sue Winski."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,They're up there with the First Lady.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And they prove that when we aim high and challenge our students, they will be the best in the world."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Let's give them a hand.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Stand up, please. [Applause] Second, to have the best schools, we must have the best teachers."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Most of us in this Chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those teachers.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I know that I wouldn't be here.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"For years, many of our educators, led by North Carolina's Governor Jim Hunt and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, have worked very hard to establish nationally accepted credentials for excellence in teaching."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Just 500 of these teachers have been certified since 1995.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My budget will enable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master teachers."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should reward and recognize our best teachers.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And as we reward them, we should quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up, and we should challenge more of our finest young people to consider teaching as a career."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Third, we must do more to help all our children read."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Forty percent--40 percent--of our 8-year-olds cannot read on their own.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why we have just launched the America Reads initiative, to build a citizen army of one million volunteer tutors to make sure every child can read independently by the end of the third grade."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We will use thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers to mobilize this citizen army.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We want at least 100,000 college students to help."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And tonight I am pleased that 60 college presidents have answered my call, pledging that thousands of their work-study students will serve for one year as reading tutors."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,This is also a challenge to every teacher and every principal.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,You must use these tutors to help students read.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And it is especially a challenge to our parents.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,You must read with your children every night.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,This leads to the fourth principle: Learning begins in the first days of life.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Scientists are now discovering how young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"The First Lady has spent years writing about this issue, studying it."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And she and I are going to convene a White House conference on early learning and the brain this spring, to explore how parents and educators can best use these startling new findings."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We already know we should start teaching children before they start school.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That's why this balanced budget expands Head Start to one million children by 2002.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And that is why the Vice President and Mrs.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Gore will host their annual family conference this June on what we can do to make sure that parents are an active part of their children's learning all the way through school.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"They've done a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our life, and now they're turning their attention to getting more parents involved in their children's learning all the way through school."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And I thank you, Mr."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Vice President, and I thank you especially, Tipper, for what you do."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Fifth, every State should give parents the power to choose the right public school for their children."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Their right to choose will foster competition and innovation that can make public schools better.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We should also make it possible for more parents and teachers to start charter schools, schools that set and meet the highest standards and exist only as long as they do."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Our plan will help America to create 3,000 of these charter schools by the next century, nearly 7 times as there are in the country today, so that parents will have even more choices in sending their children to the best schools."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Sixth, character education must be taught in our schools."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must teach our children to be good citizens.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And we must continue to promote order and discipline, supporting communities that introduce school uniforms, impose curfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from the classroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in school."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Seventh, we cannot expect our children to raise themselves up in schools that are literally falling down."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With the student population at an all-time high and record numbers of school buildings falling into disrepair, this has now become a serious national concern."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Therefore, my budget includes a new initiative, $5 billion to help communities finance $20 billion in school construction over the next 4 years."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Eighth, we must make the 13th and 14th years of education, at least 2 years of college, just as universal in America by the 21st century as a high school education is today, and we must open the doors of college to all Americans."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To do that, I propose America's HOPE scholarship, based on Georgia's pioneering program: 2 years of a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition, enough to pay for the typical community college."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I also propose a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year for all tuition after high school, an expanded IRA you can withdraw from tax free for education, and the largest increase in Pell grant scholarships in 20 years."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, this plan will give most families the ability to pay no taxes on money they save for college tuition."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to pass it and give every American who works hard the chance to go to college.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Ninth, in the 21st century, we must expand the frontiers of learning across a lifetime."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"All our people, of whatever age, must have the chance to learn new skills."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Most Americans live near a community college.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The roads that take them there can be paths to a better future.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My ""GI bill"" for America's workers will transform the confusing tangle of Federal training programs into a simple skill grant to go directly into eligible workers' hands."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"For too long, this bill has been sitting on that desk there without action."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to pass it now.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Let's give more of our workers the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Tenth, we must bring the power of the information age into all our schools."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, I challenged America to connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000, so that, for the first time in our history, children in the most isolated rural towns, the most comfortable suburbs, the poorest inner-city schools, will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"That is my plan, a call to action for American education."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Some may say that it is unusual for a President to pay this kind of attention to education.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Some may say it is simply because the President and his wonderful wife have been obsessed with this subject for more years than they can recall.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That is not what is driving these proposals.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must understand the significance of this endeavor: One of the greatest sources of our strength throughout the cold war was a bipartisan foreign policy; because our future was at stake, politics stopped at the water's edge."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now I ask you and I ask all our Nation's Governors; I ask parents, teachers, and citizens all across America for a new nonpartisan commitment to education because education is a critical national security issue for our future, and politics must stop at the schoolhouse door."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To prepare America for the 21st century, we must harness the powerful forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,This is the first State of the Union carried live in video over the Internet.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But we've only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution that should become the modern birthright of every citizen.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Our effort to connect every classroom is just the beginning.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we should connect every hospital to the Internet, so that doctors can instantly share data about their patients with the best specialists in the field."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And I challenge the private sector tonight to start by connecting every children's hospital as soon as possible, so that a child in bed can stay in touch with school, family, and friends."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,A sick child need no longer be a child alone.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must build the second generation of the Internet so that our leading universities and national laboratories can communicate in speeds 1,000 times faster than today, to develop new medical treatments, new sources of energy, new ways of working together."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But we cannot stop there.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"As the Internet becomes our new town square, a computer in every home, a teacher of all subjects, a connection to all cultures, this will no longer be a dream but a necessity."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And over the next decade, that must be our goal."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must continue to explore the heavens, pressing on with the Mars probes and the international space station, both of which will have practical applications for our everyday living."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must speed the remarkable advances in medical science.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The human genome project is now decoding the genetic mysteries of life.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,American scientists have discovered genes linked to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and medication that stops a stroke in progress and begins to reverse its effects and treatments that dramatically lengthen the lives of people with HIV and AIDS.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Since I took office, funding for AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health has increased dramatically to $1.5 billion."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With new resources, NIH will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an AIDS vaccine, working with other scientists to finally end the threat of AIDS."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Remember that every year--every year we move up the discovery of an AIDS vaccine will save millions of lives around the world.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must reinforce our commitment to medical science.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger families."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Over the past 4 years, the family and medical leave law has helped millions of Americans to take time off to be with their families."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With new pressures on people in the way they work and live, I believe we must expand family leave so that workers can take time off for teacher conferences and a child's medical checkup."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We should pass flex-time, so workers can choose to be paid for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their families."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must continue, step by step, to give more families access to affordable, quality health care."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Forty million Americans still lack health insurance.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Ten million children still lack health insurance; 80 percent of them have working parents who pay taxes.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That is wrong.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,My balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to 5 million of those children.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Since nearly half of all children who lose their insurance do so because their parents lose or change a job, my budget will also ensure that people who temporarily lose their jobs can still afford to keep their health insurance."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,No child should be without a doctor just because a parent is without a job.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My Medicare plan modernizes Medicare, increases the life of the Trust Fund to 10 years, provides support for respite care for the many families with loved ones afflicted with Alzheimer's, and for the first time, it would fully pay for annual mammograms."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Just as we ended drive-through deliveries of babies last year, we must now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of forcing women home from the hospital only hours after a mastectomy."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a mastectomy.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,With us tonight is Dr.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Kristen Zarfos, a Connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spurred a national movement and inspired this legislation."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like her to stand so we can thank her for her efforts.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Dr.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Zarfos, thank you. [Applause] In the last 4 years, we have increased child support collections by 50 percent."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a State line in an attempt to flee from this, his or her most sacred obligation."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, we must also protect our children by standing firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that endanger their lives."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To prepare America for the 21st century, we must build stronger communities."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should start with safe streets.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Serious crime has dropped 5 years in a row.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The key has been community policing.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must finish the job of putting 100,000 community police on the streets of the United States."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should pass the victims' rights amendment to the Constitution.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And I ask you to mount a full-scale assault on juvenile crime, with legislation that declares war on gangs, with new prosecutors and tougher penalties; extends the Brady bill so violent teen criminals will not be able to buy handguns; requires child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use; and helps to keep our schools open after hours, on weekends, and in the summer, so our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"This balanced budget includes the largest antidrug effort ever, to stop drugs at their source, punish those who push them, and teach our young people that drugs are wrong, drugs are illegal, and drugs will kill them."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will support it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Our growing economy has helped to revive poor urban and rural neighborhoods.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But we must do more to empower them to create the conditions in which all families can flourish and to create jobs through investment by business and loans by banks.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should double the number of empowerment zones.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"They've already brought so much hope to communities like Detroit, where the unemployment rate has been cut in half in 4 years."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should restore contaminated urban land and buildings to productive use.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should expand the network of community development banks.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach, including private-sector tax incentives, to renew our Capital City, so that Washington is a great place to work and live and once again the proud face America shows the world."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must protect our environment in every community.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In the last 4 years, we cleaned up 250 toxic waste sites, as many as in the previous 12."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we should clean up 500 more, so that our children grow up next to parks, not poison."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I urge you to pass my proposal to make big polluters live by a simple rule: If you pollute our environment, you should pay to clean it up."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In the last 4 years, we strengthened our Nation's safe food and clean drinking water laws; we protected some of America's rarest, most beautiful land in Utah's Red Rocks region, created three new national parks in the California desert, and began to restore the Florida Everglades."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now we must be as vigilant with our rivers as we are with our lands.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, I announce that this year I will designate 10 American Heritage Rivers, to help communities alongside them revitalize their waterfronts and clean up pollution in the rivers, proving once again that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must also protect our global environment, working to ban the worst toxic chemicals and to reduce the greenhouse gases that challenge our health even as they change our climate."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, we all know that in all of our communities, some of our children simply don't have what they need to grow and learn in their own homes or schools or neighborhoods."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And that means the rest of us must do more, for they are our children, too."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why President Bush, General Colin Powell, former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros will join the Vice President and me to lead the President's summit of service in Philadelphia in April."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Our national service program, AmeriCorps, has already helped 70,000 young people to work their way through college as they serve America."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now we intend to mobilize millions of Americans to serve in thousands of ways.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Citizen service is an American responsibility which all Americans should embrace, and I ask your support for that endeavor."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to make just one last point about our national community.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Our economy is measured in numbers and statistics, and it's very important."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But the enduring worth of our Nation lies in our shared values and our soaring spirit.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"So instead of cutting back on our modest efforts to support the arts and humanities, I believe we should stand by them and challenge our artists, musicians, and writers, challenge our museums, libraries, and theaters."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We should challenge all Americans in the arts and humanities to join with our fellow citizens to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the American spirit in every community, a celebration of our common culture in the century that has passed and in the new one to come in the new millennium, so that we can remain in the world's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity, long after the fireworks have faded."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To prepare America for the 21st century, we must master the forces of change in the world and keep American leadership strong and sure for an uncharted time."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Fifty years ago, a farsighted America led in creating the institutions that secured victory in the cold war and built a growing world economy."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"As a result, today more people than ever embrace our ideals and share our interests."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Already we have dismantled many of the blocs and barriers that divided our parents' world.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"For the first time, more people live under democracy than dictatorship, including every nation in our own hemisphere but one, and its day, too, will come."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, we stand at another moment of change and choice and another time to be farsighted, to bring America 50 more years of security and prosperity."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In this endeavor, our first task is to help to build, for the very first time, an undivided, democratic Europe."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"When Europe is stable, prosperous, and at peace, America is more secure."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"To that end, we must expand NATO by 1999, so that countries that were once our adversaries can become our allies."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"At the special NATO summit this summer, that is what we will begin to do."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must strengthen NATO's Partnership For Peace with non-member allies.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And we must build a stable partnership between NATO and a democratic Russia.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,An expanded NATO is good for America; and a Europe in which all democracies define their future not in terms of what they can do to each other but in terms of what they can do together for the good of all--that kind of Europe is good for America.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, America must look to the East no less than to the West."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Our security demands it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Americans fought three wars in Asia in this century.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Our prosperity requires it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,More than 2 million American jobs depend upon trade with Asia.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"There, too, we are helping to shape an Asia-Pacific community of cooperation, not conflict."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Let our progress there not mask the peril that remains.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Together with South Korea, we must advance peace talks with North Korea and bridge the cold war's last divide."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And I call on Congress to fund our share of the agreement under which North Korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapons program.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must pursue a deeper dialog with China for the sake of our interests and our ideals.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,An isolated China is not good for America; a China playing its proper role in the world is.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"I will go to China, and I have invited China's President to come here, not because we agree on everything but because engaging China is the best way to work on our common challenges like ending nuclear testing and to deal frankly with our fundamental differences like human rights."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The American people must prosper in the global economy.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We've worked hard to tear down trade barriers abroad so that we can create good jobs at home.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I am proud to say that today America is once again the most competitive nation and the number one exporter in the world.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we must act to expand our exports, especially to Asia and Latin America, two of the fastest growing regions on Earth, or be left behind as these emerging economies forge new ties with other nations."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That is why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreements that open markets to our goods and services even as we preserve our values.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"After all, we have the best workers and the best products."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In a truly open market, we can out-compete anyone, anywhere on Earth."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But this is about more than economics.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"By expanding trade, we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,There is no better example of this truth than Latin America where democracy and open markets are on the march together.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,That is why I will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important tie.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We should all be proud that America led the effort to rescue our neighbor Mexico from its economic crises.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And we should all be proud that last month Mexico repaid the United States, 3 full years ahead of schedule, with half a billion dollar profit to us."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"America must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace from the Middle East to Haiti, from Northern Ireland to Africa."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Taking reasonable risks for peace keeps us from being drawn into far more costly conflicts later.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With American leadership, the killing has stopped in Bosnia."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now the habits of peace must take hold.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,The new NATO force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I ask Congress to continue its strong support of our troops.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"They are doing a remarkable job there for America, and America must do right by them."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Fifth, we must move strongly against new threats to our security."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In the past 4 years, we agreed to ban--we led the way to a worldwide agreement to ban nuclear testing."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"With Russia, we dramatically cut nuclear arsenals, and we stopped targeting each others citizens."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We are acting to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and to rid the world of landmines.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We are working with other nations with renewed intensity to fight drug traffickers and to stop terrorists before they act and hold them fully accountable if they do.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we must rise to a new test of leadership, ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Make no mistake about it, it will make our troops safer from chemical attack; it will help us to fight terrorism."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We have no more important obligations, especially in the wake of what we now know about the Gulf war."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"This treaty has been bipartisan from the beginning, supported by Republican and Democratic administrations and Republican and Democratic Members of Congress and already approved by 68 nations."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"But if we do not act by April 29th, when this convention goes into force with or without us, we will lose the chance to have Americans leading and enforcing this effort."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Together we must make the Chemical Weapons Convention law, so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison gas from the Earth."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, we must have the tools to meet all these challenges."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must maintain a strong and ready military.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must increase funding for weapons modernization by the year 2000, and we must take good care of our men and women in uniform."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,They are the world's finest.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We must also renew our commitment to America's diplomacy and pay our debts and dues to international financial institutions like the World Bank and to a reforming United Nations.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Every dollar we devote to preventing conflicts, to promoting democracy, to stopping the spread of disease and starvation, brings a sure return in security and savings."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Yet international-affairs spending today is just one percent of the Federal budget, a small fraction of what America invested in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"If America is to continue to lead the world, we here who lead America simply must find the will to pay our way."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,A farsighted America moved the world to a better place over these last 50 years.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And so it can be for another 50 years.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,But a shortsighted America will soon find its words falling on deaf ears all around the world.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Almost exactly 50 years ago, in the first winter of the cold war, President Truman stood before a Republican Congress and called upon our country to meet its responsibilities of leadership."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"This was his warning; he said, ""If we falter, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this Nation."" That Congress, led by Republicans like Senator Arthur Vandenberg, answered President Truman's call."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Together, they made the commitments that strengthened our country for 50 years."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Now let us do the same.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us do what it takes to remain the indispensable nation, to keep America strong, secure, and prosperous for another 50 years."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"In the end, more than anything else, our world leadership grows out of the power of our example here at home, out of our ability to remain strong as one America."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"All over the world, people are being torn asunder by racial, ethnic, and religious conflicts that fuel fanaticism and terror."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We are the world's most diverse democracy, and the world looks to us to show that it is possible to live and advance together across those kinds of differences."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,America has always been a nation of immigrants.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"From the start, a steady stream of people in search of freedom and opportunity have left their own lands to make this land their home."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We started as an experiment in democracy fueled by Europeans.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We have grown into an experiment in democratic diversity fueled by openness and promise.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, we must never, ever believe that our diversity is a weakness."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,It is our greatest strength.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Americans speak every language, know every country."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"People on every continent can look to us and see the reflection of their own great potential, and they always will, as long as we strive to give all of our citizens, whatever their background, an opportunity to achieve their own greatness."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We're not there yet.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We still see evidence of abiding bigotry and intolerance in ugly words and awful violence, in burned churches and bombed buildings."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We must fight against this, in our country and in our hearts."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Just a few days before my second Inauguration, one of our country's best known pastors, Reverend Robert Schuller, suggested that I read Isaiah 58:12."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Here's what it says: ""Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in."" I placed my hand on that verse when I took the oath of office, on behalf of all Americans, for no matter what our differences in our faiths, our backgrounds, our politics, we must all be repairers of the breach."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,I want to say a word about two other Americans who show us how.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Congressman Frank Tejeda was buried yesterday, a proud American whose family came from Mexico."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,He was only 51 years old.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"He was awarded the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart fighting for his country in Vietnam."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And he went on to serve Texas and America fighting for our future here in this Chamber.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We are grateful for his service and honored that his mother, Lillie Tejeda, and his sister, Mary Alice, have come from Texas to be with us here tonight."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,And we welcome you.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Gary Locke, the newly elected Governor of Washington State, is the first Chinese-American Governor in the history of our country."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"He's the proud son of two of the millions of Asian-American immigrants who have strengthened America with their hard work, family values, and good citizenship."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,He represents the future we can all achieve.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, Governor, for being here."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Please stand up. [Applause] Reverend Schuller, Congressman Tejeda, Governor Locke, along with Kristen Tanner and Chris Getsler, Sue Winski and Dr."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Kristen Zarfos, they're all Americans from different roots whose lives reflect the best of what we can become when we are one America."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"We may not share a common past, but we surely do share a common future."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Building one America is our most important mission, the foundation for many generations of every other strength we must build for this new century."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Money cannot buy it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Power cannot compel it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Technology cannot create it.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,It can only come from the human spirit.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,America is far more than a place.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"It is an idea, the most powerful idea in the history of nations."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"And all of us in this Chamber, we are now the bearers of that idea, leading a great people into a new world."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,A child born tonight will have almost no memory of the 20th century.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Everything that child will know about America will be because of what we do now to build a new century.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,We don't have a moment to waste.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Tomorrow there will be just over 1,000 days until the year 2000; 1,000 days to prepare our people; 1,000 days to work together; 1,000 days to build a bridge to a land of new promise."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, we have work to do."
1997,Clinton,Democratic,Let us seize those days and the century.
1997,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 27, 1998 Mr."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: Since the last time we met in this Chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,In the past few weeks they've both been eulogized.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our Nation.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,For 209 years it has been the President's duty to report to you on the state of the Union.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core inflation in 30 years; incomes are rising; and we have the highest homeownership in history."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Crime has dropped for a record 5 years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Our leadership in the world is unrivaled.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Ladies and gentlemen, the state of our Union is strong."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"It is a time to build, to build the America within reach, an America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work; where every citizen can live in a safe community; where families are strong, schools are good, and all our young people can go on to college; an America where scientists find cures for diseases, from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS; an America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed; where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities; an America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,This is the America we have begun to build; this is the America we can leave to our children if we join together to finish the work at hand.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let us strengthen our Nation for the 21st century.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"For 5 years now, we have met the challenge of these changes, as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America: widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect Union."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We shaped a new kind of Government for the information age.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I thank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a Government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and most of all, a Government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, we have found a third way."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We have the smallest Government in 35 years, but a more progressive one."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We have a smaller Government, but a stronger Nation."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century: an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"First, Americans in this Chamber and across our Nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth; investments in education and skills, in science and technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new markets for American products and American workers."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"When I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion and heading higher."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion and heading lower."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"For three decades, six Presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our Nation."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I come before you to announce that the Federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros, will be, simply, zero."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year--4 years ahead of schedule."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"It is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress: the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent, and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Here's the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families, for education, for child care, for the environment."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,What should we do with this projected surplus?
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first. [Applause] Thank you.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us say to all Americans watching tonight--whether you're 70 or 50, or whether you just started paying into the system--Social Security will be there when you need it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let us make this commitment: Social Security first.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let's do that together.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion, in facing these issues squarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And one year from now I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century. [Applause] Thank you."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Because these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families: We should raise the minimum wage."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The information age is, first and foremost, an education age, in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I laid out a 10-point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Since then, this Congress--across party lines--and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation, expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year-olds can read."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year I proposed and you passed 220,000 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay--now you get to deduct the interest."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Families all over America now can put their savings into new tax-free education IRA's.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And this year, for the first 2 years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit--a HOPE scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"You did that, and you should be very proud of it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight: Your children can go on to college."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up; she can go on to college."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"If you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up; their children can go on to college."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up; he can go on to college."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And my friends, that will change the face and future of America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best as well by raising standards, raising expectations, and raising accountability."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for the very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And every parent already knows the key: good teachers and small classes.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. [Applause] Thank you.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who've passed a State competency test."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, with these teachers--listen--with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students a class, all across America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"If I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We must also demand greater accountability.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision--not to hold our children back but to lift them up."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Chicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the tools to make sure they do."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"As we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We must shape this global economy, not shrink from it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In the last 5 years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp ""Made in the USA."" Today, record high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to keep them going, because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"All of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business; and, second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,But we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all: abusive child labor."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,That's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why we must do more, and more quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes; we ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single ""GI bill"" for workers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes, and brighter futures."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We all know, in every way in life, change is not always easy, but we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And remember the big picture here: While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia, and Europe."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And we should pass the new ""African Trade Act""; it has bipartisan support."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs, which every President has had for two decades."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Recent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and beyond."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, why should Americans be concerned about this?"
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"First, these countries are our customers."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"If they sink into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, they're also our competitors."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"So if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And finally, they are our strategic partners."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Their stability bolsters our security.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Our policy is clear: No nation can recover if it does not reform itself.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder till the clouds are just overhead.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,A strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, after a record 4-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our Nation to move 2 million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal, 2 full years ahead of schedule."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence, and hope."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"For 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana, was on and off welfare."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, she's a dispatcher with a van company."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Elaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,There are millions like her all across America.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And I'm happy she could join the First Lady tonight.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Elaine, we're very proud of you."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Please stand up. [Applause] We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success--providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We have to make it possible for all hard-working families to meet their most important responsibilities.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Two years ago we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Last year we extended health care to up to 5 million children.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"These plans save money, and they can improve care."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"You have the right to emergency room care, wherever and whenever you need it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,You have the right to keep your medical records confidential.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Millions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Some are retired; some are laid off; some lose their coverage when their spouses retire.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"After a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"So I ask the Congress, let these hard-working Americans buy into the Medicare system."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Next, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion-dollar marketing campaigns."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I challenge Congress: Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco companies do business forever."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's raise the price of cigarettes by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next 10 years, with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In the new economy, most parents work harder than ever."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as President in 1993.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Since then, about 15 million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this country."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year I cohosted the very first White House Conference on Child Care with one of our foremost experts, America's First Lady."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"From all corners of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We've got to make it safer.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We've got to make it more affordable.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children; scholarships and background checks for child care workers, and a new emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees; and a larger child care tax credit for working families."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of Federal income tax."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,She and I were really very lucky.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,How many other families have never had that same opportunity?
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The truth is, we don't know the answer to that question."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,But we do know what the answer should be: Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishment, smarter prevention, with crimefighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I can report to you tonight that it's working.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Violent crime is down; robbery is down; assault is down; burglary is down--for 5 years in a row, all across America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Again, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers, to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs, and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Drug use is on the decline.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the largest antidrug budget in history."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, as good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Today there are large number of vacancies in the Federal courts.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: ""Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice."" I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified judicial nominees before you, up or down."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But make no mistake about it, today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,America must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals, and drug traffickers."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"To meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"For 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Now these three formerly Communist countries have said yes to democracy.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"By taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support of our troops and their mission in Bosnia."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Dole and a bipartisan congressional delegation.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We saw children playing in the streets, where 2 years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,The shops are filled with food; the cafes were alive with conversation.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The progress there is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"To take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I think Senator Dole actually said it best.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"He said, ""This is like being ahead in the 4th quarter of a football game."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory."" I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,One of those--[applause]--thank you--one of those brave soldiers is sitting with the First Lady tonight: Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,His father was a decorated Vietnam vet.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"After college in Colorado, he joined the Army."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Please stand up. [Applause] In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Our mission must be to keep them well-trained and ready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I'm pleased to announce that four former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell, and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe--have endorsed this treaty."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And I ask the Senate to approve it this year. [Applause] Thank you.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Together, we must confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists, and organized criminals seeking to acquire them."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people but on developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf war.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Now Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, ""You cannot defy the will of the world,"" and when I say to him, ""You have used weapons of mass destruction before."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again."" Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Now we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations. [Applause] Thank you."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"As we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,But we have to do our part.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Our Founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect Union.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"To all of you I say, it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"First, we have to continue to reform our Government, the instrument of our national community."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fundraising arms race."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, by March 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let's be clear: A vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"At least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs: the high cost of media advertising. [At this point, audience members responded.] To the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. [Laughter] I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the Federal payroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated hundreds of programs, and improved the operations of virtually every Government agency."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,But we can do more.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,This bill must not now languish in the Senate.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say ""follow the Senate"" on, so I'll be out of trouble. [Laughter] A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"For the past 5 years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas, with community development banks, more commercial loans in the poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for development."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Under the continued leadership of the Vice President, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We should--[applause]--thank you--we should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let us renew our resolve to make our Capital City a great city for all who live and visit here.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"They are still the gateways for new immigrants, from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century; they're a very important part of our future.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the Earth they will inherit."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Last year we put in place the toughest-ever controls on smog and soot.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We expanded every community's right to know about the toxins that threaten their children.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Just yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far-reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children. [Applause] Thank you."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our Nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We have it in our power to act right here, right now."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, today our economy is the strongest in a generation, and our environment is the cleanest in a generation."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard 'round the world that we are all created equal."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Throughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal and we've never fully lived up to it."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"It may be easier, but it's wrong."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,What we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation--what do we have to do?
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We're becoming more and more and more diverse.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Do you believe we can become one nation?
1998,Clinton,Democratic,The answer cannot be to dwell on our differences but to build on our shared values.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Discrimination against any American is un-American.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We also should recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans, without regard to race."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"When we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We, in this Chamber and in this Government, must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"But we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home watching tonight, is also committed to this cause."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We must work together, learn together, live together, serve together."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Wherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communication and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We are many; we must be one.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,How will we mark that passage?
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"It just happens once every 1,000 years."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"This year Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation, and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We should protect them.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I am proposing a public-private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving American's treasures, great and small."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, think about this: The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every 5 years."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"In the 1980's, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis; it took 9 years."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Last year scientists located the gene that causes Parkinson's Disease--in only 9 days.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Within a decade, ""gene chips"" will offer a roadmap for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Soon we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22d century.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for path-breaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Think of this: The first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web-- literally, just a handful of people."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, in schools, in libraries, homes, and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the Net every day."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"We must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet, but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"For one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next-generation Internet."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"It's getting kind of clogged, you know, and the next-generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than today."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're going to open new frontiers in outer space."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Throughout all history, humankind has had only one place to call home, our planet, Earth."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens, the international space station."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one 5-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Godspeed, John Glenn. [Applause] John, you will carry with you America's hopes."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"And on your uniform, once again, you will carry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that became our national anthem."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, that Star-Spangled Banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, are on display just a short walk from here."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"They are America's treasures, and we must also save them for the ages."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America; an America that has continued to rise through every age, against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation--to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect Union."
1998,Clinton,Democratic,Let that be our gift to the 21st century.
1998,Clinton,Democratic,"God bless you, and God bless the United States."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 19, 1999 Mr."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: Tonight, I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Let me begin by saluting the new Speaker of the House, and thanking him, especially tonight, for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the gallery with Mrs."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Hastert: Lyn Gibson and Wenling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Mr.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, at your swearing-in, you asked us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Mr.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, let's do exactly that."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And now we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the Middle East.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a Government for the information age."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Once again, a Government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our oldest values of opportunity, responsibility, and community; devoted to fiscal responsibility; determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century; a 21st century Government for 21st century America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of our Union is strong."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, America is working again."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The promise of our future is limitless.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge, the aging of America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a senior boom."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So first, and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Early in this century, being old meant being poor."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"When President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called ""the stark terror of penniless, helpless old age."" Even today, without Social Security, half our Nation's elderly would be forced into poverty."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, Social Security is strong."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"By 2032, the Trust Fund will be exhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefits older Americans have been promised."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll tax rates, not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector, just as any private or State Government pension would do."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But we must aim higher.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other seniors."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices over and above the dedication of the surplus."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,They must be made on a bipartisan basis.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,They should be made this year.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both Houses, in both parties, and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,First things first.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve Medicare."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Already, we have extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 10 years, but we should extend it for at least another decade."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, I propose that we use one out of every $6 in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But again, we should aim higher."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare Commission."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniors, affordable prescription drugs."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Third, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the job to save, to invest, to create wealth."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"From its beginning, Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Yet, today, millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accounts--USA accounts--to give all Americans the means to save.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With these new accounts Americans can invest as they choose and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with extra help for those least able to save."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our Nation's wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to support them.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Fourth, we must invest in long-term care."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled, and the families who care for them."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Long-term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America, and we must do more to help our families deal with it."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take it."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Saving Social Security, Medicare, creating USA accounts: This is the right way to use the surplus."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,If we do so--if we do so--we will still have resources to meet critical needs in education and defense.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Listen to this: If we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16 percent for Medicare, over the next 15 years, that saving will achieve the lowest level of publicly held debt since right before World War I, in 1917."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So with these four measures--saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care--we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, there are more children from more diverse backgrounds in our public schools than at any time in our history."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire Nation to thrive in the new economy.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Today we can say something we couldn't say 6 years ago: With tax credits and more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more Pell grants, with education IRA's and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than 5 million Americans will receive this year, we have finally opened the doors of college to all Americans."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With our support, nearly every State has set higher academic standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With over $1 billion in discounts available this year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Now I ask you to finish the job.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, our children are doing better."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,SAT scores are up; math scores have risen in nearly all grades.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But there's a problem.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"While our fourth graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science, our eighth graders are around average, and our twelfth graders rank near the bottom."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must do better.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, each year the National Government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"First, later this year, I will send to Congress a plan that, for the first time, holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"My ""Education Accountability Act"" will require every school district receiving Federal help to take the following five steps."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"First, all schools must end social promotion."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But we can't just hold students back because the system fails them.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after-school programs, to keep a million children learning."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, if you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Math and reading scores are up 3 years running with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"It will work, and we should do it."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, all States and school districts must turn around their worst-performing schools or shut them down."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,That's the policy established in North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,North Carolina made the biggest gains in test scores in the Nation last year.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Our budget includes $200 million to help States turn around their own failing schools.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Third, all States and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The great majority of our teachers do a fine job.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors-- or even minors--in the subjects they teach."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"New teachers should be required to pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the subjects they're teaching."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,This year's balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher standards.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner cities and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Let us bring excellence in every part of America.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In too many communities, it's easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Every school district should issue report cards on every school.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And parents should be given more choices in selecting their public school.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With our support, on a bipartisan basis, today there are 1,100."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"My budget assures that early in the next century, there will be 3,000."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say that all States and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policies."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, let's do one more thing for our children."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, too many schools are so old they're falling apart, or so over-crowded students are learning in trailers."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"If we do these things--end social promotion; turn around failing schools; build modern ones; support qualified teachers; promote innovation, competition and discipline--then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century schools."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The most basic tool of all is a decent income.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,So let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next 2 years.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"That was encouraging, you know. [Laughter] There was more balance on the seesaw."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I like that.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Let's give them a hand.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,That's great. [Applause] Working parents also need quality child care.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So again this year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after- school programs."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stay- at-home parents, too."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"They need support, as well."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first bill I signed into law, has now, since 1993, helped millions and millions of Americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I think it's time, with all the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers, to extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working for smaller companies."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I hope you will support it.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally on the matter of work, parents should never have to face discrimination in the workplace."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,So I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,That is not right.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,America's families deserve the world's best medical care.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to bipartisan Federal support for medical research, we are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's, to arthritis to cancer."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But as we continue our advances in medical science, we can't let our medical system lag behind."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I think we ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"If you need a specialist, you should have a right to see one."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,You have a right to the nearest emergency care if you're in an accident.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,These are things that we ought to say.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And I think we ought to say: You should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether it's a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment, or anything else."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I believe this.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, I've ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health programs."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But only Congress can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, last year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that opportunity again."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For the sake of our families, I ask us to join together across party lines and pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to all our privacy increase."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to the American people, ""We will protect the privacy of medical records, and we will do it this year."" Now 2 years ago, the Congress extended health coverage to up to 5 million children."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Now we should go beyond that.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And we should continue to ensure access to family planning.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation, proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of working families who don't have any insurance."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"They do a lot of that today, but much more can be done."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And my balanced budget makes a good down payment toward that goal.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will think about them and support that provision.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,No American should ever be afraid--ever--to address this disease.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With sensitivity, commitment, and passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I'd like to thank her for what she's done."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Thank you. [Applause] Thank you.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect our children from tobacco, and to hold tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare and other programs.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, the States have been right about this: Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses; the tobacco companies should."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and, with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, if we act in these areas--minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care, the safety of our children--then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibilities to strengthen our families for the 21st century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in history."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embraces all Americans.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Today's income gap is largely a skills gap.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, the Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I applaud all of you here who were part of that.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, I recommend a 5-year commitment to the new system so that we can provide, over the next 5 years, appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will support this.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Also, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in Federal support for adult literacy, to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth grade level."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We need to do this.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Here's some good news: In the past 6 years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,You can all be proud of that.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will support it.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American communities, with more support for community development banks, for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more vouchers for affordable housing."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas with tax credits, loan guarantees, including the new ""American Private Investment Company,"" modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Company."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For years and years and years, we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets overseas."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas; they are right here at home.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And we should go after them.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"As this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farms."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, the Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to join with me and do this.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,This should not be a political issue.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must strengthen our lead in technology.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,It was Government investment that led to the creation of the Internet.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I propose a 28- percent increase in long-term computing research.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment, by solving the so- called Y2K computer problem."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We had one Member of Congress stand up and applaud. [Laughter] And we may have about that ratio out there applauding at home, in front of their television sets."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But remember, this is a big, big problem."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And we've been working hard on it.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Already, we've made sure that the Social Security checks will come on time."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every State and local government, every business, large and small, to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth came from exports."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,This is the most serious financial crisis in half a century.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"To meet it, the United States and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And while the turmoil is not over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"At the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term project, building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of Asia."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"This June I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose, and I ask all of you to support our endeavors."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century America.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this Chamber in both parties.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I think trade has divided us, and divided Americans outside this Chamber, for too long."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and Government can stand together.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I believe these are the things we ought to all agree on.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,So let me try.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"First, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade, a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must insist that international trade organizations be more open to public scrutiny, instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We have got to put a human face on the global economy.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our Nation.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I have already informed the Government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America will respond."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2 billion.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade, based on these principles."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the President the trade authority long used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global trade negotiations to expand exports of services, manufactures, and farm products."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"If we do these things--invest in our people, our communities, our technology, and lead in the global economy--then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful, more secure, more free."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the Serbian Government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice, and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Some of you were with me last December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye agreement to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must not--we dare not--let them down.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will help.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our Nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this summer when we struck at Usama bin Ladin's network of terror."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The bombing of our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So let's give them the support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergenices, to support research into vaccines and treatments."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next 5 years.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,It's been 2 years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the treaty now, to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end nuclear testing forever."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"America will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when Iraq has a Government worthy of its people."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10- year veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,He's here with us tonight.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"I'd like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Captain Taliaferro. [Applause] It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next 6 years for readiness, for modernization, and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community in America by millions of our veterans.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"America's defenders today still stand ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,They always come through for America.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must come through for them.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,America needs a strong and effective U.N.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia, expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In China, last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But I'd also like to say again to the American people: It's important not to isolate China.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rising but still held back by violence and disease."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the ""African Trade and Development Act."" We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy and increase trade."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by its people."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the blessings of liberty."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The American people have opened their hearts and their arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Working with Congress, I am committed to help them rebuild."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and Americans, working side-by-side."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,With her was someone else who has been very important to the relief efforts.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, sports records are made and, sooner or later, they're broken."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But making other people's lives better, and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood--that lasts forever."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So, for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in two countries tonight. [Applause] Thank you."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So I say to all of you, if we do these things--if we pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances--we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"As the world has changed, so have our own communities."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We must make them safer, more livable, and more united."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"The Brady bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years and the crime rate has dropped for 6 straight years."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Our balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to prisoners: If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars; and to those on parole: If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of drugs."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I ask Congress to restore the 5-day waiting period for buying a handgun and extend the Brady bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents don't have to live through their loss.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came here to the White House with a powerful plea."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"She said, ""Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town."" It's a message she is passionately advocating every day."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Suzann is here with us tonight, with the First Lady."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I'd like to thank her for her courage and her commitment. [Applause] Thank you.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to keep our children safe."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our ""great, central task"" as ""leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us."" Today, we're restoring the Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red rock canyons of Utah, protecting California's redwoods and our precious coasts."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming; 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year's heat waves, floods, and storms are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollution, and tax incentives and investments to spur clean energy technology."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And I want to work with Members of Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"All our communities face a preservation challenge, as they grow and green space shrinks."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In response, I propose two major initiatives: First, a $1-billion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic congestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life; and second, a $1-billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across America from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"These are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the Vice President, and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something back."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why we created AmeriCorps, our national service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So far, in just 4 years, 100,000 young Americans have built low- income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped to tutor children with churches, worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters, and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Last year the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan and Senators McCain and Feingold.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But a partisan minority in the Senate blocked reform.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So I'd like to say to the House: Pass it again, quickly."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I'd like to say to the Senate: I hope you will say yes to a stronger American democracy in the year 2000.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Since 1997, our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In its report last fall, the initiative's advisory board found that Americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We know it's been a long journey.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For some, it goes back to before the beginning of our Republic; for others, back since the Civil War; for others, throughout the 20th century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense, this journey began 43 years ago, when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"She's sitting down with the First Lady tonight, and she may get up or not, as she chooses."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We thank her. [Applause] Thank you, Rosa."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the Presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,The initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,But we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong, and it ought to be illegal."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Therefore, I ask Congress to make the ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act"" and the ""Hate Crimes Prevention Act"" the law of the land."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, since every person in America counts, every American ought to be counted."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do that.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Our new immigrants must be part of our One America.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"After all, they're revitalizing our cities; they're energizing our culture; they're building up our economy."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will support it.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"This is a moment, as the First Lady has said, ""to honor the past and imagine the future."" I'd like to take just a minute to honor her."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"For leading our Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all she has done in her historic role to serve our Nation and our best ideals at home and abroad, I honor her. [Applause] Last year, I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America's treasures."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Hillary has traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"And tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to become a nationally recognized ""millennium community,"" by launching projects that save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare our children for the 21st century."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Already, the response has been remarkable."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,And I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to Members in Congress of both parties for their support.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Just one example: Because of you, the Star-Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"In ways large and small, as we look to the millennium we are keeping alive what George Washington called ""the sacred fire of liberty."" Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"But across this country, in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,I knew then that we Americans could renew this country.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that ""more perfect Union"" of our Founders' dream."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"We're now at the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming depression, lifting up the disposed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, winning two World Wars and the long twilight struggle of the cold war."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebears in this century.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Yet, perhaps, in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we don't see our own time for what it truly is, a new dawn for America."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"A hundred years from tonight, another American President will stand in this place and report on the state of the Union."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,He--or she--he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now.
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time but of their time, that we reached as high as our ideals, that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness, that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, this is our moment."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Let us lift our eyes as one Nation, and from the mountaintop of this American Century, look ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country."
1999,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, and good evening."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 27, 2000 Mr."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Never before has our Nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founders' dreams."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African- American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to- back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We have built a new economy.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down 7 years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half to their lowest levels in 30 years."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"As always, the real credit belongs to the American people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,My gratitude also goes to those of you in this Chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Then our Nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"The title of a best-selling book asked: ""America: What Went Wrong?"" In the best traditions of our Nation, Americans determined to set things right."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We reinvented Government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"With the smallest Federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We cut crime with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We ended welfare as we knew it, requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We've helped parents to succeed at home and at work with family leave, which 20 million Americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We've engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,In 1992 we just had a roadmap.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, we have results."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Even more important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For we, all of us, will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good is so great."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution of opportunity, responsibility, and community."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We must be now, as we were in the beginning, a new nation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, ""The one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight . . . it should be the growing Nation with a future that takes the long look ahead."" So tonight, let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our Nation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"To 21st century America, let us pledge these things: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work, and no child will be raised in poverty."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We will meet the challenge of the aging of America.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We will assure quality, affordable health care, at last, for all Americans."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We will make America the safest big country on Earth.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835.* We will bring prosperity to every American community.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safer, cleaner planet."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And we will become at last what our Founders pledged us to be so long ago: One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [* White House correction.] These are great goals, worthy of a great nation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We will not reach them all this year, not even in this decade."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we will reach them.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot; the continent was not settled in a single year.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"The lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 years is that great goals are reached step by step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And for too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,So let's begin tonight with them.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Again, I ask you to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to pass campaign finance reform.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to vote up or down on judicial nominations and other important appointees.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And again, I ask you--I implore you to raise the minimum wage."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, 2 years ago--let me try to balance the seesaw here-- [laughter]--2 years ago, as we reached across party lines to reach our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable 7 years ago."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We are actually paying down the national debt.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, if we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 years now and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President in 1835."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,He's here with us tonight.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American, Social Security and Medicare."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 years.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But this is just the start of our journey.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We must also take the right steps toward reaching our great goals.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every single child can learn."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Because education is more important than ever, more than ever the key to our children's future, we must make sure all our children have that key."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That means quality pre-school and after- school, the best trained teachers in the classroom, and college opportunities for all our children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For 7 years now, we've worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility, investing more but demanding more in turn."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Reading, math, college entrance scores are up."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Some of the most impressive gains are in schools in very poor neighborhoods.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But all successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher standards, more accountability, and extra help so children who need it can get it to reach those standards."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,It holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Each year, our National Government invests more than $15 billion in our schools."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,It is time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn't.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, as we demand more from our schools, we should also invest more in our schools."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Let's double our investment to help States and districts turn around their worst-performing schools or shut them down.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Let's double our investments in after-school and summer school programs, which boost achievement and keep people off the streets and out of trouble."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"If we do this, we can give every single child in every failing school in America--everyone--the chance to meet high standards."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Since 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I ask you for another $1 billion for Head Start, the largest increase in the history of the program."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For 2 years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I thank you for that, and I ask you to make it three in a row."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative, to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We know charter schools provide real public school choice.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, thanks to you, there are 1,700."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3,000 charter schools by next year."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet, and we're getting there."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In 1994, only 3 percent of our classrooms were connected."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Today, with the help of the Vice President's E-rate program, more than half of them are."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And 90 percent of our schools have at least one Internet connection.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we cannot finish the job when a third of all our schools are in serious disrepair.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Many of them have walls and wires so old, they're too old for the Internet."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"So tonight, I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate and urgent repairs and, again, to help build or modernize 6,000 more, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan GEAR UP program, which provides mentors for disadvantaged young people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"If we double it, we can provide mentors for 1.4 million of them."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Let's also offer these kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the same chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"To make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For 7 years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more affordable student loans, education IRA's, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, 67 percent of high school graduates are going on to college."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That's up 10 percent since 1993.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,They need help.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"So I propose a landmark $30- billion college opportunity tax cut, a middle class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The previous actions of this Congress have already made 2 years of college affordable for all.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,It's time make 4 years of college affordable for all.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"If we take all these steps, we'll move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all, raising children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That means making sure every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"From my first days as President, we've worked to give families better access to better health care."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In 1997, we passed the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIP--so that workers who don't have coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"So far, we've enrolled 2 million children; we're well on our way to our goal of 5 million."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But there are still more than 40 million of our fellow Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I propose that we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their children.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Together with our children's initiative--think of this--together with our children's initiative, this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in America."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Again, I want to ask you to let people between the ages of 55 and 65, the fastest growing group of uninsured, buy into Medicare."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And this year I propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I hope you will support that, as well."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"When the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens; yet, it is far from ready to do so."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,My generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We simply must act now to strengthen and modernize Medicare.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and more competitive."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And at long last, it also provides funds to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Yet more than three in five of our seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Millions of older Americans, who need prescription drugs the most, pay the highest prices for them."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all our seniors this lifeline of affordable prescription drugs."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Record numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,It's a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Frankly, it wasn't enough."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"This year let's triple it to $3,000."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But this year, let's pass it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We also have to make needed investments to expand access to mental health care.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first White House Conference on Mental Health last year and who for 7 years has led all our efforts to break down the barriers to decent treatment of people with mental illness.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, Tipper Gore."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since Medicare was created--the largest investment in 35 years."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That would be a big step toward assuring quality health care for all Americans, young and old."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I ask you to embrace them and pass them.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We must also make investments that reward work and support families.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Nothing does that better than the earned-income tax credit, the EITC."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"The ""E"" in the EITC is about earning, working, taking responsibility, and being rewarded for it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In my very first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this credit, and you did."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That's double the number in 1993.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I propose another major expansion of the EITC: to reduce the marriage penalty, to make sure it rewards marriage as it rewards work, and also to expand the tax credit for families that have more than two children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,It punishes people with more than two children today.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Our proposal would allow families with three or more children to get up to $1,100 more in tax relief."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,These are working families; their children should not be in poverty.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We also can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Today the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 46 years.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Yet, women still only earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We must do better, by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the ""Paycheck Fairness Act."" Many working parents spend up to a quarter--a quarter--of their income on child care."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about 2 million children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My child care initiative, before you now, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to pass that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,They need it out there.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For hard-pressed middle income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income families.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For people making under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child care costs."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, we all say we're pro-work and pro-family."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Passing this proposal would prove it.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Ten of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"As hard as they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Too few can make use of IRA's and 401k plans.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We should do more to help all working families save and accumulate wealth.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That's the idea behind the Individual Development Accounts, the IDA's."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask you to take that idea to a new level, with new retirement savings accounts that enable every low- and moderate-income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its workers.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Nearly one in three American children grows up without a father.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,These children are 5 times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all our children out of poverty."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We've doubled child support collections since 1992.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I'm proposing to you tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children but need help to do it.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Carlos Rosas of St.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Paul, Minnesota, wanted to do right by his son, and he got the help to do it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now he's got a good job, and he supports his little boy."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My budget will help 40,000 more fathers make the same choices Carlos Rosas did."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I thank him for being here tonight.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Stand up, Carlos. [Applause] Thank you."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"If there is any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party lines, it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Just remember what we did last year.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We came together to help people with disabilities keep their health insurance when they go to work.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I thank you for that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We've helped those young people who leave it when they turn 18, and we have dramatically increased the number of foster care children going into adoptive homes."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I thank all of you for all of that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who's worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now, my wife, Hillary, and I thank her."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"If we take the steps just discussed, we can go a long, long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We can make these vital investments in health care, education, support for working families, and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents, to reduce the marriage penalty."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We can do these things without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Indeed, we must make these investments and these tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Crime in America has dropped for the past 7 years--that's the longest decline on record--thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But nobody, nobody here, nobody in America believes we're safe enough."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"So again, I ask you to set a higher goal."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Let's make this country the safest big country in the world.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last fall, Congress supported my plan to hire, in addition to the 100,000 community police we've already funded, 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask your continued support for that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered commonsense gun legislation, to require Brady background checks at the gun shows, child safety locks for new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"With courage and a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President--[laughter]--the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But the House failed to follow suit.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, we have all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Somehow he has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this Congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Tom Mauser, stand up."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We thank you for being here tonight.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Tom.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, Tom."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We must strengthen our gun laws and enforce those already on the books better.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we must do more.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I propose to hire more Federal and local gun prosecutors and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And we must give them the enforcement tools that they need, tools to trace every gun and every bullet used in every gun crime in the United States."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to help us do that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Every State in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now specifically, I propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyers must first have a photo license from their State showing they passed the Brady background check and a gun safety course, before they get the gun."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you'll help me pass that in this Congress.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Listen to this--listen to this.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The accidental gun rate--the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than in the other 25 industrialized countries combined.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask Congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these children's lives.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands to keep our children safe.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But frankly, the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be really useful to parents."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"So tonight, I ask the industry to accept the First Lady's challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The steps I outline will take us well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, to keep our historic economic expansion going, the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others, I believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, hire new workers right here in America, in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and Native American reservations."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Our Nation's prosperity hasn't yet reached these places.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Over the last 6 months, I've traveled to a lot of them, joined by many of you and many far-sighted business people, to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge reservation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Everywhere I go, I meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I ask you, let's put them to work."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For business, it's the smart thing to do."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For America, it's the right thing to do."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And let me ask you something: If we don't do this now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it?"
2000,Clinton,Democratic,So I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America's new markets they now have to invest in markets overseas.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital to create new businesses and new investments in our inner cities and rural areas.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Because empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for 5 years now, I also ask you to increase incentives to invest in them and to create more of them."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And let me say to all of you again what I have tried to say at every turn: This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Giving people a chance to live their dreams is an American issue.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Mr.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined Reverend Jesse Jackson and me in your home State of Illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to thank you again and to tell you, Mr."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Speaker, I look forward to working with you."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,This is a worthy joint endeavor.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Thank you.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I also ask you to make special efforts to address the areas of our Nation with the highest rates of poverty, our Native American reservations and the Mississippi Delta."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My budget includes a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Delta and a billion dollars to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for our Native American communities."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We should begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I want to thank tonight the leaders and the members from both parties who've expressed to me an interest in working with us on these efforts.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,They are profoundly important.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"There's another part of our American community in trouble tonight, our family farmers."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Well, droughts, floods, and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the farmers."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation, and create some new markets for them by expanding our programs for bio-based fuels and products."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Please, they need help."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Let's do it together.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Opportunity for all requires something else today, having access to a computer and knowing how to use it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That means we must close the digital divide between those who've got the tools and those who don't.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's just a start."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills, and it creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"This spring, I'll invite high-tech leaders to join me on another new markets tour, to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to thank the high-tech companies that already are doing so much in this area.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will get all the rest of them to join us.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,This is a national crusade.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We have got to do this and do it quickly.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, again I say to you, these are steps, but step by step, we can go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"To realize the full possibilities of this economy, we must reach beyond our own borders, to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals and economies and cultures: globalization."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,It's the central reality of our time.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, change this profound is both liberating and threatening to people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But there's no turning back.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the realities of interdependence."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We have to be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and a good partner."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The first thing we have got to do is to forge a new consensus on trade.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade, we have to ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But others must recognize that open markets and rule-based trade are the best engines we know of for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I believe, as strongly tonight as I did the first day I got here, the only direction forward for America on trade--the only direction for America on trade is to keep going forward."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to help me forge that consensus.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We have to make developing economies our partners in prosperity.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That's why I would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean Basin trade initiatives.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But globalization is about more than economics.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"First, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Both are being held back today from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, an economy in turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But think how much has changed in the past decade: 5,000 former Soviet nuclear weapons taken out of commission; Russian soldiers actually serving with ours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in a thousand years; and in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Of course, no one, not a single person in this Chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nations will take."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we do know for sure that we can choose what we do.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of our global community."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That's why we should support those Russians who are struggling for a democratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help Russia to safeguard weapons and materials that remain."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And that's why I believe Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations with China as soon as possible this year."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I think you ought to do it for two reasons: First of all, our markets are already open to China; this agreement will open China's markets to us; and second, it will plainly advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"No, we don't know where it's going."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,All we can do is decide what we're going to do.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But when all is said and done, we need to know we did everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that China will choose the right future."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,A second challenge we've got is to protect our own security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We can't prevent every conflict or stop every outrage.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we should be, and we must be, peacemakers."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We should be proud of our role in bringing the Middle East closer to a lasting peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse these crises between India and Pakistan, in defending human rights and religious freedom."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And we should be proud of the men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, enabling a million people to return to their homes."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And when another American plane was shot down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thanks to our Armed Forces' skill and bravery, we prevailed in Kosovo without losing a single American in combat."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to introduce Captain Cherrey to you.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We honor Captain Cherrey, and we promise you, Captain, we'll finish the job you began."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Stand up so we can see you.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,A third challenge we have is to keep this inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Keep in mind, the same technological advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals, and developing a system to defend against new missile threats, while working to preserve our ABM missile treaty with Russia."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We must do all these things.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I predict to you, when most of us are long gone but some time in the next 10 to 20 years, the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemies of the nation state: the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals, who will be organized together, working together, with increasing access to ever-more sophisticated chemical and biological weapons."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And I want to thank the Pentagon and others for doing what they're doing right now to try to help protect us and plan for that, so that our defenses will be strong."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask for your support to ensure they can succeed.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which I hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that is presented to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I think we have to do our part to change that with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of freedom."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"This is interesting: From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people got the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We've got to stand by these democracies, including, and especially tonight, Colombia, which is fighting narcotraffickers, for its own people's lives and our children's lives."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I have proposed a strong 2-year package to help Colombia win this fight.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to thank the leaders in both parties in both Houses for listening to me and the President of Colombia about it.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We have got to pass this.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to ask your help.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,A lot is riding on it.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And it's so important for the long-term stability of our country and for what happens in Latin America.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I also want you to know I'm going to send you new legislation to go after what these drug barons value the most, their money."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I hope you'll pass that as well.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries, so they can invest in education, health care, and economic growth."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That's what the Pope and other religious leaders have urged us to do.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And last year, Congress made a downpayment on America's share."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to continue that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I thank you for what you did and ask you to stay the course.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I also want to say that America must help more nations to break the bonds of disease.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year in Africa, 10 times as many people died from AIDS as were killed in wars--10 times."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The budget I give you invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And today I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB, and AIDS."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We can save millions of lives together, and we ought to do it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I also want to mention our final challenge, which, as always, is the most important."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask you to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, which raises salaries for our service men and women, which protects our veterans, which fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, which makes good on our commitment to our U.N. dues and arrears."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I ask you to pass this budget.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I also want to say something, if I might, very personal tonight."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"The American people watching us at home, with the help of all the commentators, can tell, from who stands and who sits and who claps and who doesn't, that there's still modest differences of opinion in this room. [Laughter] But I want to thank you for something, every one of you."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have given, Republicans and Democrats alike, to our men and women in uniform."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I thank you for that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I also want to thank, especially, two people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"First, I want to thank our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to national security."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, sir."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Even more, I want to thank his wife, Janet, who, more than any other American citizen, has tirelessly traveled this world to show the support we all feel for our troops."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, Janet Cohen."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I appreciate that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Thank you.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,These are the challenges we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I want to tell you that I am very grateful for many things as President.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But one of the things I'm grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"As our economy has grown, we've rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In the past 3 months alone, we've helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless lands in the national forests, created three new national monuments."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must continue to grow."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect coastlines, save natural treasures, from the California redwoods to the Florida Everglades."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,This lands legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed in this House.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I hope we can get together with all the people with different ideas and do this.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"This is a gift we should give to our children and our grandchildren for all time, across party lines."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We can make an agreement to do this.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year the Vice President launched a new effort to make communities more liberal--livable--[laughter]--liberal, I know. [Laughter] Wait a minute, I've got a punchline now."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That's this year's agenda; last year was livable, right? [Laughter] That's what Senator Lott is going to say in the commentary afterwards--[laughter]--to make our communities more livable."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,This is big business.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,This is a big issue.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,What does that mean?
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"You ask anybody that lives in an unlivable community, and they'll tell you."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"They want their kids to grow up next to parks, not parking lots; the parents don't have to spend all their time stalled in traffic when they could be home with their children."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Tonight I ask you to support new funding for the following things, to make American communities for liberal--livable. [Laughter] I've done pretty well with this speech, but I can't say that."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"One, I want you to help us to do three things."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We need more funding for advanced transit systems.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We need more funding for saving open spaces in places of heavy development.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And we need more funding--this ought to have bipartisan appeal--we need more funding for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We need these things, and I want you to help us."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The scientists tell us the 1990's were the hottest decade of the entire millennium.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies will be disrupted."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That is going to happen, unless we act."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Many people in the United States, some people in this Chamber, and lots of folks around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions without slowing economic growth."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In the industrial age, that may well have been true."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But in this digital economy, it is not true anymore."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon, the fruits of a unique research partnership between Government and industry."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And before you know it, efficient production of bio-fuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gasoline."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"To speed innovation in these kind of technologies, I think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of super efficient cars when they hit the showroom floor."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuel-efficient right away.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I ask this Congress to do something else.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the developing world.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new jobs here in the United States of America.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In the new century, innovations in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome, the very blueprint of life."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"It is important for all our fellow Americans to recognize that Federal tax dollars have funded much of this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"For example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's, diabetes, and certain kinds of cancer; they are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effect of these genes for good."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Researchers already are using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and--listen to this-- microchips that would actually directly stimulate damaged spinal cords in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,These kinds of innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Information technology only includes 8 percent of our employment, but now it counts for a third of our economic growth along with jobs that pay, by the way, about 80 percent above the private sector average."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Again, we ought to keep in mind, Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into being."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can talk, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight, and--this is unbelievable to me--molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fastest supercomputers."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"To accelerate the march of discovery across all these disciplines in science and technology, I ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We owe it to our future.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, these new breakthroughs have to be used in ways that reflect our values."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"First and foremost, we have to safeguard our citizens' privacy."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Last year we proposed to protect every citizen's medical record.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,This year we will finalize those rules.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We've also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card records and other financial statements.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Soon I will send legislation to you to finish that job.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employers or insurers.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,I hope you will support that.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,These steps will allow us to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"They will enhance our health, the environment, the economy in ways we can't even imagine today."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But we all know that at a time when science, technology, and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into all our lives, it's more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national community."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,No tie binds different people together like citizen service.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"There's a new spirit of service in America, a movement we've tried to support with AmeriCorps, expanded Peace Corps, unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, community groups; partnerships, for example, like the one that enlisted 12,000 companies which have now moved 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work; partnerships to battle drug abuse, AIDS, teach young people to read, save America's treasures, strengthen the arts, fight teen pregnancy, prevent violence among young people, promote racial healing."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The American people are working together.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,But we should do more to help Americans help each other.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"First, we should help faith-based organizations to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track, with initiatives like Second Chance Homes that do so much to help unwed teen mothers."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Second, we should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities but don't earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Tonight I propose new tax incentives that would allow low and middle income citizens who don't itemize to get that deduction.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"It's nothing but fair, and it will get more people to give."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We should do more to help new immigrants to fully participate in our community.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That's why I recommend spending more to teach them civics and English.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And since everybody in our community counts, we've got to make sure everyone is counted in this year's census."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Within 10 years--just 10 years--there will be no majority race in our largest State of California.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Just look around this Chamber.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Look around.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We have Members in this Congress from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And I think you would agree that America is stronger because of it. [Applause] You also have to agree that all those differences you just clapped for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Just in the last couple of years, we've seen a man dragged to death in Texas just because he was black."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We saw a young man murdered in Wyoming just because he was gay.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last year we saw the shootings of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Jewish children just because of who they were."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"This is not the American way, and we must draw the line."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the ""Hate Crimes Prevention Act"" and the ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act."" And I ask you to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Finally tonight, I propose the largest ever investment in our civil rights laws for enforcement, because no American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Protections in law should be protections in fact.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Last February, because I thought this was so important, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"That's what one of my personal heroes, Hank Aaron, has done all his life."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"From his days as our all-time home run king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought people together."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We should follow his example, and we're honored to have him with us tonight."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Stand up, Hank Aaron."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"I just want to say one more thing about this, and I want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"This fall, at the White House, Hillary had one of her millennium dinners, and we had this very distinguished scientist there, who is an expert in this whole work in the human genome."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And he said that we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9 percent the same."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Now, you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here. [Laughter] But it is worth remembering."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We can laugh about this, but you think about it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Modern science has confirmed what ancient faiths have always taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Therefore, we should do more than just tolerate our diversity; we should honor it and celebrate it."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, every time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our Nation."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"But tonight is very special, because we stand on the mountain top of a new millennium."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of American achievement, and before us we can see even greater, grander frontiers of possibility."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"We should, all of us, be filled with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We should be filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And we should be filled with absolute determination to make the most of it.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"You know, when the Framers finished crafting our Constitution in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall, and he reflected on the carving of the Sun that was on the back of a chair he saw."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,The Sun was low on the horizon.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"So he said this--he said, ""I've often wondered whether that Sun was rising or setting."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Today,"" Franklin said, ""I have the happiness to know it's a rising Sun."" Today, because each succeeding generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of Mr."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,Franklin's rising sun.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"After 224 years, the American revolution continues."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,We remain a new nation.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"And as long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be forever young."
2000,Clinton,Democratic,That is our destiny.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,And this is our moment.
2000,Clinton,Democratic,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS February 27, 2001 THE PRESIDENT: Mr."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Vice President, members of Congress: It's a great privilege to be here to outline a new budget and a new approach for governing our great country."
2001,GWBush,Republican,I thank you for your invitation to speak here tonight.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I know Congress had to formally invite me, and it could have been a close vote. (Laughter.) So, Mr."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Vice President, I appreciate you being here to break the tie. (Laughter.) I want to thank so many of you who have accepted my invitation to come to the White House to discuss important issues."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We're off to a good start.
2001,GWBush,Republican,I will continue to meet with you and ask for your input.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"You have been kind and candid, and I thank you for making a new President feel welcome. (Applause.) The last time I visited the Capitol, I came to take an oath on the steps of this building."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I pledged to honor our Constitution and laws. (Applause.) And I asked you to join me in setting a tone of civility and respect in Washington. (Applause.) I hope America is noticing the difference, because we're making progress."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Together, we are changing the tone in the Nation's Capital."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And this spirit of respect and cooperation is vital, because, in the end, we will be judged not only by what we say or how we say it, we will be judged by what we're able to accomplish."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"America today is a nation with great challenges, but greater resources."
2001,GWBush,Republican,An artist using statistics as a brush could paint two very different pictures of our country.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"One would have warning signs: increasing layoffs, rising energy prices, too many failing schools, persistent poverty, the stubborn vestiges of racism."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Another picture would be full of blessings: a balanced budget, big surpluses, a military that is second to none, a country at peace with its neighbors, technology that is revolutionizing the world, and our greatest strength -- concerned citizens who care for our country and care for each other."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Neither picture is complete in and of itself.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And tonight I challenge and invite Congress to work with me to use the resources of one picture to repaint the other; to direct the advantages of our time to solve the problems of our people.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Some of these resources will come from government.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Some, but not all."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Year after year in Washington, budget debates seem to come down to an old, tired argument: on one side, those who want more government, regardless of the cost; on the other, those who want less government, regardless of the need."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We should leave those arguments to the last century, and chart a different course. (Applause.) Government has a role, and an important role."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Yet, too much government crowds out initiative and hard work, private charity and the private economy."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Our new governing vision says government should be active, but limited; engaged, but not overbearing."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And my budget is based on that philosophy.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It is reasonable, and it is responsible."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It meets our obligations, and funds our growing needs."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We increase spending next year for Social Security and Medicare, and other entitlement programs, by $81 billion."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We've increased spending for discretionary programs by a very responsible 4 percent, above the rate of inflation."
2001,GWBush,Republican,My plan pays down an unprecedented amount of our national debt.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And then, when money is still left over, my plan returns it to the people who earned it in the first place. (Applause.) A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Excellent schools, quality health care, a secure retirement, a cleaner environment, a stronger defense -- these are all important needs, and we fund them."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The highest percentage increase in our budget should go to our children's education. (Applause.) Education is not my top priority -- education is my top priority and, by supporting this budget, you'll make it yours, as well."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Reading is the foundation of all learning.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"So during the next five years, we triple spending, adding $5 billion to help every child in America learn to read."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Values are important, so we've tripled funding for character education to teach our children not only reading and writing, but right from wrong. (Applause.) We've increased funding to train and recruit teachers, because we know a good education starts with a good teacher."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And I have a wonderful partner in this effort.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I like teachers so much, I married one. (Applause.) Laura has begun a new effort to recruit Americans to the profession that will shape our future -- teaching."
2001,GWBush,Republican,She will travel across America to promote sound teaching practices and early reading skills in our schools and in programs such as Head Start.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"When it comes to our schools, dollars alone do not always make the difference."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Funding is important, and so is reform."
2001,GWBush,Republican,So we must tie funding to higher standards and accountability for results. (Applause.) I believe in local control of schools.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We should not, and we will not, run public schools from Washington, D.C. (Applause.) Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year between grades three and eight.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And I want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America. (Applause.) Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning."
2001,GWBush,Republican,They talk about teaching to the test.
2001,GWBush,Republican,But let's put that logic to the test.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And that's the whole idea. (Applause.) As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"So we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into five, and let states spend money in those categories as they see fit. (Applause.) Schools will be given a reasonable chance to improve and the support to do so."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Yet, if they don't, if they continue to fail, we must give parents and students different options -- a better public school, a private school, tutoring or a charter school. (Applause.) In the end, every child in a bad situation must be given a better choice because, when it comes to our children, failure is simply not an option. (Applause.) Another priority in my budget is to keep the vital promises of Medicare and Social Security, and together we will do so."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"To meet the health care needs of all America's seniors, we double the Medicare budget over the next 10 years."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"My budget dedicates $238 billion to Medicare next year alone, enough to fund all current programs and to begin a new prescription drug benefit for low-income seniors. (Applause.) No senior in America should have to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions. (Applause.) To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors are not diverted in any other program, my budget protects all $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, and for Social Security alone. (Applause.) My budget puts a priority on access to health care, without telling Americans what doctor they have to see or what coverage they must choose."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Many working Americans do not have health care coverage, so we will help them buy their own insurance with refundable tax credits. (Applause.) And to provide quality care in low-income neighborhoods, over the next five years we will double the number of people served at community health care centers. (Applause.) And we will address the concerns of those who have health coverage, yet worry their insurance company doesn't care and won't pay."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Together this Congress and this President will find common ground to make sure doctors make medical decisions, and patients get the health care they deserve with a patients' bill of rights. (Applause.) When it comes to their health, people want to get the medical care they need, not be forced to go to court because they didn't get it."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We will ensure access to the courts for those with legitimate claims.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"But first, let's put in place a strong, independent review so we promote quality health care, not frivolous lawsuits. (Applause.) My budget also increases funding for medical research, which gives hope to many who struggle with serious disease."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Our prayers tonight are with one of your own who is engaged in his own fight against cancer -- a fine representative, and a good man, Congressman Joe Moakley. (Applause.) I can think of no more appropriate tribute to Joe than to have the Congress finish the job of doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health. (Applause.) My new Freedom Initiative for Americans with Disabilities funds new technologies, expands opportunities to work, and makes our society more welcoming."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"For the more than 50 million Americans with disabilities, we need to break down barriers to equality. (Applause.) The budget I propose to you also supports the people who keep our country strong and free, the men and women who serve in the United States military. (Applause.) I'm requesting $5.7 billion in increased military pay and benefits, and health care and housing."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Our men and women in uniform give America their best and we owe them our support. (Applause.) America's veterans honored their commitment to our country through their military service.
2001,GWBush,Republican,I will honor our commitment to them with a million-dollar increase to ensure better access to quality care and faster decisions on benefit claims. (Applause.) My budget will improve our environment by accelerating the cleanup of toxic brownfields.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And I propose we make a major investment in conservation by fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund. (Applause.) Our national parks have a special place in our country's life.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Our parks are places of great natural beauty and history.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"As good stewards, we must leave them better than we found them."
2001,GWBush,Republican,So I propose providing $4.9 billion over five years for the upkeep of these national treasures. (Applause.) And my budget adopts a hopeful new approach to help the poor and the disadvantaged.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We must encourage and support the work of charities and faith-based and community groups that offer help and love one person at a time. (Applause.) These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Government should welcome these groups to apply for funds, not discriminate against them. (Applause.) Government cannot be replaced by charities or volunteers."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Government should not fund religious activities. (Applause.) But our nation should support the good works of these good people who are helping their neighbors in need. (Applause.) So I propose allowing all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not, to deduct their charitable contributions."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Estimates show this could encourage as much as $14 billion a year in new charitable giving, money that will save and change lives. (Applause.) Our budget provides more than $700 million over the next 10 years for a federal compassion capital fund, with a focused and noble mission, to provide a mentor to the more than 100 million children with a parent in prison, and to support other local efforts to fight illiteracy, teen pregnancy, drug addiction and other difficult problems. (Applause.) With us tonight is the Mayor of Philadelphia."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Please help me welcome Mayor John Street. (Applause.) Mayor Street has encouraged faith-based and community organizations to make a significant difference in Philadelphia.
2001,GWBush,Republican,He's invited me to his city this summer to see compassionate action.
2001,GWBush,Republican,I'm personally aware of just how effective the Mayor is.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Mayor Street's a Democrat. (Applause.) Let the record show, I lost his city, big time. (Applause.) But some things are bigger than politics."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"So I look forward to coming to your city, to see your faith-based programs in action. (Applause.) As government promotes compassion, it also must promote justice."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our nation's justice, when the law points a finger of suspicion at groups, instead of individuals."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"All our citizens are created equal, and must be treated equally. (Applause.) Earlier today, I asked John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific recommendations to end racial profiling."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It's wrong and we will end it in America. (Applause.) In so doing, we will not hinder the work of our nation's brave police officers."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They protect us every day -- often at great risk. (Applause.) But by stopping the abuses of a few, we will add to the public confidence our police officers earn and deserve. (Applause.) My budget has funded a responsible increase in our ongoing operations."
2001,GWBush,Republican,It has funded our nation's important priorities.
2001,GWBush,Republican,It has protected Social Security and Medicare.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And our surpluses are big enough that there is still money left over.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Many of you have talked about the need to pay down our national debt.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I listened, and I agree. (Applause.) We owe it to our children and grandchildren to act now, and I hope you will join me to pay down $2 trillion in debt during the next 10 years. (Applause.) At the end of those 10 years, we will have paid down all the debt that is available to retire. (Applause.) That is more debt, repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by any nation at any time in history. (Applause.) We should also prepare for the unexpected, for the uncertainties of the future."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We should approach our nation's budget as any prudent family would, with a contingency fund for emergencies or additional spending needs."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"For example, after a strategic review, we may need to increase defense spending."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We may need to increase spending for our farmers or additional money to reform Medicare.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And so, my budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 years for additional needs."
2001,GWBush,Republican,That is one trillion additional reasons you can feel comfortable supporting this budget. (Applause.) We have increased our budget at a responsible 4 percent.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We have funded our priorities.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We paid down all the available debt.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We have prepared for contingencies.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And we still have money left over.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Yogi Berra once said, ""When you come to a fork in the road, take it."" (Laughter.) Now, we come to a fork in the road; we have two choices."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Even though we have already met our needs, we could spend the money on more and bigger government."
2001,GWBush,Republican,That's the road our nation has traveled in recent years.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, government spending shot up 8 percent."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"That's far more than our economy grew, far more than personal income grew, and far more than the rate of inflation."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"If you continue on that road, you will spend the surplus and have to dip into Social Security to pay other bills. (Applause.) Unrestrained government spending is a dangerous road to deficits, so we must take a different path. (Applause.) The other choice is to let the American people spend their own money to meet their own needs. (Applause.) I hope you will join me in standing firmly on the side of the people."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"You see, the growing surplus exists because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The people of America have been overcharged and, on their behalf, I am here asking for a refund. (Applause.) Some say my tax plan is too big. (Applause.) Others say it's too small. (Applause.) I respectfully disagree. (Laughter.) This plan is just right. (Applause.) I didn't throw darts at the board to come up with a number for tax relief."
2001,GWBush,Republican,I didn't take a poll or develop an arbitrary formula that might sound good.
2001,GWBush,Republican,I looked at problems in the Tax Code and calculated the cost to fix them.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"A tax rate of 15 percent is too high for those who earn low wages, so we must lower the rate to 10 percent. (Applause.) No one should pay more than a third of the money they earn in federal income taxes, so we lowered the top rate to 33 percent. (Applause.) This reform will be welcome relief for America's small businesses, which often pay taxes at the highest rate."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And help for small business means jobs for Americans. (Applause.) We simplified the Tax Code by reducing the number of tax rates from the current five rates to four lower ones, 10 percent, 15, 25 and 33 percent."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"In my plan, no one is targeted in or targeted out."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Everyone who pays income taxes will get relief. (Applause.) Our government should not tax, and thereby discourage marriage, so we reduced the marriage penalty. (Applause.) I want to help families rear and support their children, so we doubled the child credit to $1,000 per child. (Applause.) It's not fair to tax the same earnings twice -- once when you earn them, and again when you die -- so we must repeal the death tax. (Applause.) These changes add up to significant help."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery bill for three months."
2001,GWBush,Republican,That's real money.
2001,GWBush,Republican,With us tonight representing many American families are Steven and Josefina Ramos. (Applause.) They are from Pennsylvania. (Applause.) But they could be from any one of your districts.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Steven is the network administrator for a school district.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Josefina is a Spanish teacher at a charter school.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And they have a two-year-old daughter.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"My plan will save them more than $2,000."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Let me tell you what Steven says: ""Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years' time."" After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's college education."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"My attitude is, government should never stand in the way of families achieving their dreams. (Applause.) And as we debate this issue, always remember, the surplus is not the government's money, the surplus is the people's money. (Applause.) For lower-income families, my tax plan restores basic fairness."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Right now, complicated tax rules punish hard work."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"A waitress supporting two children on $25,000 a year can lose nearly half of every additional dollar she earns above the $25,000."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Her overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 20 percent."
2001,GWBush,Republican,This sends a terrible message: you'll never get ahead.
2001,GWBush,Republican,But America's message must be different.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We must honor hard work, never punish it. (Applause.) With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed time for the waitress. (Applause.) People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And millions of additional American families will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely. (Applause.) Tax relief is right and tax relief is urgent.
2001,GWBush,Republican,The long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago is faltering.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Lower interest rates will eventually help, but we cannot assume they will do the job all by themselves."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Forty years ago, and then 20 years ago, two Presidents, one Democrat, one Republican, John F."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, advocated tax cuts to, in President Kennedy's words, get this country moving again."
2001,GWBush,Republican,They knew then what we must do now.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"To create economic growth and opportunity, we must put money back into the hands of the people who buy goods and create jobs. (Applause.) We must act quickly."
2001,GWBush,Republican,The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has testified before Congress that tax cuts often come too late to stimulate economic recovery.
2001,GWBush,Republican,So I want to work with you to give our economy an important jump-start by making tax relief retroactive. (Applause.) We must act now because it is the right thing to do.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We must also act now because we have other things to do.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We must show courage to confront and resolve tough challenges, to restructure our nation's defenses, to meet our growing need for energy, and to reform Medicare and Social Security."
2001,GWBush,Republican,America has a window of opportunity to extend and secure our present peace by promoting a distinctly American internationalism.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We will work with our allies and friends to be a force for good and a champion of freedom.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will work for free markets, free trade and freedom from oppression."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Nations making progress toward freedom will find America is their friend.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We will promote our values.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We will promote the peace.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And we need a strong military to keep the peace.
2001,GWBush,Republican,But our military was shaped to confront the challenges of the past.
2001,GWBush,Republican,So I've asked the Secretary of Defense to review America's Armed Forces and prepare to transform them to meet emerging threats.
2001,GWBush,Republican,My budget makes a down payment on the research and development that will be required.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Yet, in our broader transformation effort, we must put strategy first, then spending."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Our defense vision will drive our defense budget, not the other way around. (Applause.) Our nation also needs a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 21st century -- threats that are more widespread and less certain."
2001,GWBush,Republican,They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defenses. (Applause.) And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs. (Applause.) A strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade agreements.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly. (Applause.) As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high cost of energy."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. (Applause.) The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I've asked federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior members in my administration to develop a national energy policy. (Applause.) Our energy demand outstrips our supply."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. (Applause.) We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. (Applause.) We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must. (Applause.) America must become more energy-independent, and we will. (Applause.) Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Medicare's finances are strained and its coverage is outdated.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare does not.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux and Congressman Thomas, and now is the time to act. (Applause.) Medicare must be modernized, and we must make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs. (Applause.) Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Every one in this chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And we only have a couple of years to get prepared.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits."
2001,GWBush,Republican,There is a better way.
2001,GWBush,Republican,This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security.
2001,GWBush,Republican,The commission will make its recommendations by next fall.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement.
2001,GWBush,Republican,It must return Social Security to sound financial footing.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them. (Applause.) Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They are the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security. (Applause.) By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign reforms. (Applause.) The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"America is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Much has been given to us, and much is expected."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Let us agree to bridge old divides.
2001,GWBush,Republican,But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to great goals.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Bipartisan is more than minding our matters.
2001,GWBush,Republican,It is doing our duty. (Applause.) No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"As so many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we're reminded of their courage and achievement."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Yet America's purpose is never found only in statues or history.
2001,GWBush,Republican,America's purpose always stands before us.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country."
2001,GWBush,Republican,This is the privilege and responsibility we share.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We all came here for a reason.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We all have things we want to accomplish and promises to keep.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Juntos podemos -- together we can. (Applause.) We can make Americans proud of their government.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Together we can share in the credit of making our country more prosperous and generous and just, and earn from our conscience and from our fellow citizens the highest possible praise: Well done, good and faithful servants."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Thank you all.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Good night and God bless. (Applause.)
2001,GWBush,Republican,"ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS September 20, 2001 THE PRESIDENT: Mr."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Mr."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"President Pro Tempore, members of Congress, and fellow Americans: In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the Union."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight, no such report is needed."
2001,GWBush,Republican,It has already been delivered by the American people.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground -- passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight. (Applause.) We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past exhaustion."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers -- in English, Hebrew, and Arabic."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our Union -- and it is strong. (Applause.) Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. (Applause.) I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"All of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol, singing ""God Bless America."" And you did more than sing; you acted, by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our country. (Applause.) And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own: dozens of Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"America has no truer friend than Great Britain. (Applause.) Once again, we are joined together in a great cause -- so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with America."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Thank you for coming, friend. (Applause.) On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Americans have known wars -- but for the past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Americans have known the casualties of war -- but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Americans have known surprise attacks -- but never before on thousands of civilians.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"All of this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Americans have many questions tonight.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Americans are asking: Who attacked our country?
2001,GWBush,Republican,The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They are the same murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the USS Cole."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime.
2001,GWBush,Republican,But its goal is not making money; its goal is remaking the world -- and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.
2001,GWBush,Republican,The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics -- a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinction among military and civilians, including women and children."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"This group and its leader -- a person named Osama bin Laden -- are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan."
2001,GWBush,Republican,There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror."
2001,GWBush,Republican,They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.
2001,GWBush,Republican,The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda's vision for the world."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Afghanistan's people have been brutalized -- many are starving and many have fled.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Women are not allowed to attend school.
2001,GWBush,Republican,You can be jailed for owning a television.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate.
2001,GWBush,Republican,A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The United States respects the people of Afghanistan -- after all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid -- but we condemn the Taliban regime. (Applause.) It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land. (Applause.) Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your country."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to appropriate authorities. (Applause.) Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. (Applause.) The Taliban must act, and act immediately."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate."
2001,GWBush,Republican,I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We respect your faith.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. (Applause.) The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself."
2001,GWBush,Republican,The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that supports them. (Applause.) Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated. (Applause.) Americans are asking, why do they hate us?"
2001,GWBush,Republican,They hate what we see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elected government.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Their leaders are self-appointed.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan."
2001,GWBush,Republican,They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East.
2001,GWBush,Republican,They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They stand against us, because we stand in their way."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We have seen their kind before.
2001,GWBush,Republican,They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions -- by abandoning every value except the will to power -- they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends: in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies. (Applause.) Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war?"
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will direct every resource at our command -- every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war -- to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. (Applause.) From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Our nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack.
2001,GWBush,Republican,We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security."
2001,GWBush,Republican,These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level.
2001,GWBush,Republican,So tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me -- the Office of Homeland Security.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend -- Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge. (Applause.) He will lead, oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may come."
2001,GWBush,Republican,These measures are essential.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows. (Applause.) Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayers."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: Be ready."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I've called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud. (Applause.) This is not, however, just America's fight."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And what is at stake is not just America's freedom.
2001,GWBush,Republican,This is the world's fight.
2001,GWBush,Republican,This is civilization's fight.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We ask every nation to join us.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world."
2001,GWBush,Republican,The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded -- with sympathy and with support.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the world: An attack on one is an attack on all.
2001,GWBush,Republican,The civilized world is rallying to America's side.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments."
2001,GWBush,Republican,And you know what -- we're not going to allow it. (Applause.) Americans are asking: What is expected of us?
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I ask you to live your lives, and hug your children."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come here."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them."
2001,GWBush,Republican,No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith. (Applause.) I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security; and for your patience in what will be a long struggle."
2001,GWBush,Republican,I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity.
2001,GWBush,Republican,They did not touch its source.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"America is successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our strengths today. (Applause.) And, finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights, and take new measures to prevent hijacking."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency. (Applause.) We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. (Applause.) We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act, and find them before they strike. (Applause.) We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy, and put our people back to work."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers: Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. (Applause.) As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City. (Applause.) After all that has just passed -- all the lives taken, and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them -- it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Some speak of an age of terror.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"I know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"But this country will define our times, not be defined by them."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world. (Applause.) Great harm has been done to us."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We have suffered great loss.
2001,GWBush,Republican,And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment.
2001,GWBush,Republican,Freedom and fear are at war.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The advance of human freedom -- the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time -- now depends on us."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Our nation -- this generation -- will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail. (Applause.) It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Even grief recedes with time and grace.
2001,GWBush,Republican,But our resolve must not pass.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Each of us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened."
2001,GWBush,Republican,We'll remember the moment the news came -- where we were and what we were doing.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Some will remember an image of a fire, or a story of rescue."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"And I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"This is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end. (Applause.) I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it."
2001,GWBush,Republican,I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people.
2001,GWBush,Republican,"The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them. (Applause.) Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice -- assured of the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come."
2001,GWBush,Republican,"In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America."
2001,GWBush,Republican,Thank you. (Applause.)
2002,GWBush,Republican,"STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS January 29, 2002 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Mr.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Yet the state of our Union has never been stronger. (Applause.) We last met in an hour of shock and suffering.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"In four short months, our nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan's terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression. (Applause.) The American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.) And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own. (Applause.) America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror.
2002,GWBush,Republican,We'll be partners in rebuilding that country.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And this evening we welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid Karzai. (Applause.) The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's new government."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, Doctor Sima Samar. (Applause.) Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States military. (Applause.) When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight, thanks to them, we are winning the war on terror. (Applause.) The man and women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United States: Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on mountaintops and in caves -- you will not escape the justice of this nation. (Applause.) For many Americans, these four months have brought sorrow, and pain that will never completely go away."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero, to feel closer to his two sons who died there."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father: Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven."
2002,GWBush,Republican,I don't want to play football until I can play with you again some day.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Last month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, a CIA officer and Marine who died in Mazur-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell: ""Semper Fi, my love."" Shannon is with us tonight. (Applause.) Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and all who gave their lives for freedom."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Our cause is just, and it continues."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true scope of the task ahead."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos, where they laugh about the loss of innocent life."
2002,GWBush,Republican,And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We have found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our war against terror is only beginning."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps, and so were tens of thousands of others."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Yet, tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"These enemies view the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they are. (Applause.) So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And America and our allies must not, and will not, allow it. (Applause.) Our nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And, second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world. (Applause.) Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"A terrorist underworld -- including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-i-Mohammed -- operates in remote jungles and deserts, and hides in the centers of large cities."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American, and still hold hostages."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"My hope is that all nations will heed our call, and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Many nations are acting forcefully.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf. (Applause.) But some governments will be timid in the face of terror."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will. (Applause.) Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th.
2002,GWBush,Republican,But we know their true nature.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade."
2002,GWBush,Republican,This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens -- leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children.
2002,GWBush,Republican,This is a regime that agreed to international inspections -- then kicked out the inspectors.
2002,GWBush,Republican,This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred."
2002,GWBush,Republican,They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack. (Applause.) And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to ensure our nation's security.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We'll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"I will not wait on events, while dangers gather."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons. (Applause.) Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun."
2002,GWBush,Republican,This campaign may not be finished on our watch -- yet it must be and it will be waged on our watch.
2002,GWBush,Republican,We can't stop short.
2002,GWBush,Republican,If we stop now -- leaving terror camps intact and terror states unchecked -- our sense of security would be false and temporary.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight. (Applause.) Our first priority must always be the security of our nation, and that will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress."
2002,GWBush,Republican,My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we'll protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"September the 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in this Congress."
2002,GWBush,Republican,And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve. (Applause.) Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"I'm a proud member of my party -- yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans. (Applause.) It costs a lot to fight this war."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We have spent more than a billion dollars a month -- over $30 million a day -- and we must be prepared for future operations.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile, to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best training -- and they also deserve another pay raise. (Applause.) My budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades -- because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay. (Applause.) The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Time and distance from the events of September the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons.
2002,GWBush,Republican,America is no longer protected by vast oceans.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad, and increased vigilance at home."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We'll increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters. (Applause.) We will improve intelligence collection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States. (Applause.) Homeland security will make America not only stronger, but, in many ways, better."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health.
2002,GWBush,Republican,Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs. (Applause.) And as government works to better secure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"A few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who had been trained by al Qaeda and was armed with explosives."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"The people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 lives."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones. (Applause.) Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the American people. (Applause.) To achieve these great national objectives -- to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy -- our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner. (Applause.) We have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas: We'll prevail in the war, and we will defeat this recession. (Applause.) Americans who have lost their jobs need our help and I support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage. (Applause.) Yet, American workers want more than unemployment checks -- they want a steady paycheck. (Applause.) When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word: jobs. (Applause.) Good jobs begin with good schools, and here we've made a fine start. (Applause.) Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"I was proud to work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and Congressman George Miller. (Applause.) Senator Judd Gregg. (Applause.) And I was so proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend, Ted Kennedy. (Laughter and applause.) I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn't believe I'd say such a thing -- (laughter) -- but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results. (Applause.) There is more to do."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs. (Applause.) We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America: a quality teacher in every classroom. (Applause.) Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil. (Applause.) Good jobs depend on expanded trade."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Selling into new markets creates new jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority. (Applause.) On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation. (Applause.) Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. (Applause.) Last year, some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big. (Applause.) But when the checks arrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right. (Applause.) Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent. (Applause.) The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment, and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"For the sake of American workers, let's pass a stimulus package. (Applause.) Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"As we reauthorize these important reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job. (Applause.) Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security."
2002,GWBush,Republican,I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients' bill of rights -- (applause) -- to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage -- (applause) -- to approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans' health -- (applause) -- and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs. (Applause.) A good job should lead to security in retirement.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"I ask Congress to enact new safeguards for 401K and pension plans. (Applause.) Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails. (Applause.) Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct. (Applause.) Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social Security, and we will."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them. (Applause.) Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues: productive farm policy -- (applause) -- a cleaner environment -- (applause) -- broader home ownership, especially among minorities -- (applause) -- and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith-based groups. (Applause.) I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we've applied to our war against terrorism. (Applause.) During these last few months, I've been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"They were as wrong as they are evil. (Applause.) The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and compassion, strength and resolve."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"As I have met the heroes, hugged the families, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe of the American people."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And I hope you will join me -- I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.) None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Yet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We were reminded that we are citizens, with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate, and more about the good we can do."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"For too long our culture has said, ""If it feels good, do it."" Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: ""Let's roll."" (Applause.) In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We've been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass. (Applause.) My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two years -- 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime -- to the service of your neighbors and your nation. (Applause.) Many are already serving, and I thank you."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"If you aren't sure how to help, I've got a good place to start."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps."
2002,GWBush,Republican,The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home; rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout the world.
2002,GWBush,Republican,One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security.
2002,GWBush,Republican,America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies; volunteers to help police and fire departments; transportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.
2002,GWBush,Republican,Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison."
2002,GWBush,Republican,And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers."
2002,GWBush,Republican,And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double its volunteers over the next five years -- (applause) -- and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world. (Applause.) This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity -- a moment we must seize to change our culture."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with greater good. (Applause.) And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"All fathers and mothers, in all societies, want their children to be educated, and live free from poverty and violence."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic ""street"" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Let the skeptics look to Islam's own rich history, with its centuries of learning, and tolerance and progress."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere. (Applause.) No nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We have no intention of imposing our culture.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"But America will always stand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance. (Applause.) America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"In every region, free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom. (Applause.) The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return to normal."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"In some ways, it has."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"In others, it never will."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We've come to know truths that we will never question: evil is real, and it must be opposed. (Applause.) Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger together."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"Deep in the American character, there is honor, and it is stronger than cynicism."
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And many have discovered again that even in tragedy -- especially in tragedy -- God is near. (Applause.) In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we've been called to a unique role in human events."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.
2002,GWBush,Republican,Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and murder.
2002,GWBush,Republican,They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We stand for a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our founding."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We affirm it again today.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"We choose freedom and the dignity of every life. (Applause.) Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on."
2002,GWBush,Republican,We have known freedom's price.
2002,GWBush,Republican,We have shown freedom's power.
2002,GWBush,Republican,"And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory."
2002,GWBush,Republican,Thank you all.
2002,GWBush,Republican,May God bless. (Applause.)
2003,GWBush,Republican,"STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS January 28, 2003 Mr."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: Every year, by law and by custom, we meet here to consider the state of the union."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"This year, we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead."
2003,GWBush,Republican,You and I serve our country in a time of great consequence.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"During this session of Congress, we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country...and we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared...and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the American people.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In all these days of promise and days of reckoning, we can be confident."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In a whirlwind of change, and hope, and peril, our faith is sure, our resolve is firm, and our union is strong."
2003,GWBush,Republican,This country has many challenges.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congresses, other presidents, and other generations."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We will confront them with focus, and clarity, and courage."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"During the last two years, we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To lift the standards of our public schools, we achieved historic education reform - which must now be carried out in every school, and every classroom, so that every child in America can read, and learn, and succeed in life."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To protect our country, we reorganized our government and created the Department of Homeland Security - which is mobilizing against the threats of a new era."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To bring our economy out of recession, we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To insist on integrity in American business, we passed tough reforms, and we are holding corporate criminals to account."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Some might call this a good record.
2003,GWBush,Republican,I call it a good start.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I ask the House and Senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Our first goal is clear: We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"After recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, and stock market declines, our economy is recovering - yet it is not growing fast enough, or strongly enough."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"With unemployment rising, our Nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, ""Help Wanted."" Jobs are created when the economy grows; the economy grows when Americans have more money to spend and invest; and the best, fairest way to make sure Americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place."
2003,GWBush,Republican,I am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And under my plan, as soon as I have signed the bill, this extra money will start showing up in workers' paychecks."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty, we should do it now."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars, we should send the checks to American families now."
2003,GWBush,Republican,This tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes - and it will help our economy immediately.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Ninety-two million Americans will keep - this year - an average of almost 1,100 dollars more of their own money."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"A family of four with an income of 40,000 dollars would see their federal income taxes fall from 1,178 dollars to 45 dollars per year."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"You, the Congress, have already passed all these reductions, and promised them for future years."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"If this tax relief is good for Americans three, or five, or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws.
2003,GWBush,Republican,It is fair to tax a company's profits.
2003,GWBush,Republican,It is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To boost investor confidence, and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income, I ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand.
2003,GWBush,Republican,More jobs mean more taxpayers - and higher revenues to our government.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth - and to show some spending discipline in Washington, D.C."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We must work together to fund only our most important priorities.
2003,GWBush,Republican,I will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year - about as much as the average family's income is expected to grow.
2003,GWBush,Republican,And that is a good benchmark for us: Federal spending should not rise any faster than the paychecks of American families.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"A growing economy, and a focus on essential priorities, will also be crucial to the future of Social Security."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"As we continue to work together to keep Social Security sound and reliable, we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Our second goal is high quality, affordable health care for all Americans."
2003,GWBush,Republican,The American system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation - with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Yet for many people, medical care costs too much - and many have no coverage at all."
2003,GWBush,Republican,These problems will not be solved with a nationalized health care system that dictates coverage and rations care.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Instead, we must work toward a system in which all Americans have a good insurance policy...choose their own doctors..and seniors and low-income Americans receive the help they need."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Instead of bureaucrats, and trial lawyers, and HMOs, we must put doctors, and nurses, and patients back in charge of American medicine."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Health care reform must begin with Medicare, because Medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in America.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Seniors happy with the current Medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And just like you, the members of Congress, members of your staffs, and other federal employees, all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs."
2003,GWBush,Republican,My budget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen Medicare.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening Medicare - I urge the members of this new Congress to act this year.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To improve our health care system, we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs - the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Because of excessive litigation, everybody pays more for health care - and many parts of America are losing fine doctors."
2003,GWBush,Republican,No one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit - and I urge the Congress to pass medical liability reform.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving the environment."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation, to develop cleaner technology, and to produce more energy at home."
2003,GWBush,Republican,I have sent you Clear Skies legislation that mandates a 70 percent cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I have sent you a Healthy Forests Initiative, to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities, kill wildlife, and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I urge you to pass these measures, for the good of both our environment and our economy."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Even more, I ask you to take a crucial step, and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In this century, the greatest environmental progress will come about, not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations, but through technology and innovation."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I am proposing 1.2 billion dollars in research funding so that America can lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered automobiles."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"A simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy, which can be used to power a car - producing only water, not exhaust fumes."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"With a new national commitment, our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom - so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Join me in this important innovation - to make our air significantly cleaner, and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of America to the deepest problems of America.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"For so many in our country - the homeless, the fatherless, the addicted - the need is great."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Yet there is power - wonder-working power - in the goodness, and idealism, and faith of the American people."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Americans are doing the work of compassion every day - visiting prisoners, providing shelter to battered women, bringing companionship to lonely seniors."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"These good works deserve our praise...they deserve our personal support...and, when appropriate, they deserve the assistance of our government."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the Citizen Service Act - to encourage acts of compassion that can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, I called on my fellow citizens to participate in USA Freedom Corps, which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across America."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I ask Congress and the American people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens - boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention...and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad.
2003,GWBush,Republican,I propose a 450 million dollar initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Government will support the training and recruiting of mentors, yet it is the men and women of America who will fill the need."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"One mentor, one person, can change a life forever - and I urge you to be that one person."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Addiction crowds out friendship, ambition, moral conviction, and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"As a government, we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies, and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Yet for those already addicted, the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Too many Americans in search of treatment cannot get it.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight I propose a new 600 million dollar program to help an additional 300,000 Americans receive treatment over the next three years."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Our Nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"One of them is found at the Healing Place Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"A man in the program said, ""God does miracles in people .s lives, and you never think it could be you."" Tonight, let us bring to all Americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope: The miracle of recovery is possible, and it could be you."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"By caring for children who need mentors, and for addicted men and women who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming society - a culture that values every life."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I ask you to protect infants at the very hour of birth, and end the practice of partial-birth abortion."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment, I ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning."
2003,GWBush,Republican,The qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in America also determine our conduct abroad.
2003,GWBush,Republican,The American flag stands for more than our power and our interests.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Our Founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity - the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"This conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted, and defend the peace, and confound the designs of evil men."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In Afghanistan, we helped to liberate an oppressed people...and we will continue helping them secure their country, rebuild their society, and educate all their children - boys and girls."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In the Middle East, we will continue to seek peace between a secure Israel and a democratic Palestine."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Across the earth, America is feeding the hungry; more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the United States."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"As our Nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer, we must also remember our calling, as a blessed country, to make this world better."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30 million people have the AIDS virus - including three million children under the age of 15."
2003,GWBush,Republican,There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection.
2003,GWBush,Republican,More than four million require immediate drug treatment.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims - only 50,000 - are receiving the medicine they need."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Almost all who do are turned away.
2003,GWBush,Republican,A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"He says, ""We have no medicines..many hospitals tell [people], 'You've got AIDS."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We can't help you.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Go home and die.' "" In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words."
2003,GWBush,Republican,AIDS can be prevented.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And the cost of those drugs has dropped from 12,000 dollars a year to under 300 dollars a year - which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad, tonight I propose the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief - a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"This comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new AIDS infections...treat at least two million people with life-extending drugs...and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from AIDS, and for children orphaned by AIDS."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I ask the Congress to commit 15 billion dollars over the next five years, including nearly ten billion dollars in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean."
2003,GWBush,Republican,This Nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature.
2003,GWBush,Republican,And this Nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism.
2003,GWBush,Republican,There are days when the American people do not hear news about the war on terror.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"There is never a day when I do not learn of another threat, or receive reports of operations in progress, or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The war goes on, and we are winning."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To date we have arrested, or otherwise dealt with, many key commanders of al-Qaida."
2003,GWBush,Republican,They include a man who directed logistics and funding for the September 11th attacks...the chief of al-Qaida operations in the Persian Gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in East Africa and the USS Cole...an al-Qaida operations chief from Southeast Asia...a former director of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan...a key al-Qaida operative in Europe..and a major al-Qaida leader in Yemen.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"All told, more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And many others have met a different fate.
2003,GWBush,Republican,They are no longer a problem for the United States and our friends and allies.
2003,GWBush,Republican,We are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"America and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the American embassy in Yemen...the American embassy in Singapore...a Saudi military base...and ships in the straits of Hormuz, and the straits of Gibraltar."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We have broken al-Qaida cells in Hamburg, and Milan, and Madrid, and London, and Paris - as well as Buffalo, New York."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We have the terrorists on the run, and we are keeping them on the run."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"One by one, the terrorists are learning the meaning of American justice."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"As we fight this war, we will remember where it began - here, in our own country."
2003,GWBush,Republican,This government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry...posted more than 50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports...begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox...and are deploying the Nation's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And this year, for the first time, we are beginning to field a defense to protect this Nation against ballistic missiles."
2003,GWBush,Republican,I thank the Congress for supporting these measures.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"I ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio-terrorism, called Project Bioshield."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The budget I send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax, botulinum toxin, Ebola, and plague."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons, and we must act before the dangers are upon us."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Since September 11th, our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The FBI is improving its ability to analyze intelligence, and transforming itself to meet new threats."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight, I am instructing the leaders of the FBI, Central Intelligence, Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense to develop a Terrorist Threat Integration Center, to merge and analyze all threat information in a single location."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Our government must have the very best information possible, and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect our citizens."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Our war against terror is a contest of will, in which perseverance is power."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In the ruins of two towers, at the western wall of the Pentagon, on a field in Pennsylvania, this Nation made a pledge, and we renew that pledge tonight: Whatever the duration of this struggle, and whatever the difficulties, we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men...free people will set the course of history."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror...the gravest danger facing America and the world...is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"They could also give or sell those weapons to their terrorist allies, who would use them without the least hesitation."
2003,GWBush,Republican,This threat is new; America's duty is familiar.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great nations...built armies and arsenals..and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism, militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States of America."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Now, in this century, the ideology of power and domination has appeared again, and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Once again, this Nation and our friends are all that stand between a world at peace, and a world of chaos and constant alarm."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Once again, we are called to defend the safety of our people, and the hopes of all mankind."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And we accept this responsibility.
2003,GWBush,Republican,America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We have called on the United Nations to fulfill its charter, and stand by its demand that Iraq disarm."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We are strongly supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union, and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In all of these efforts, however, America's purpose is more than to follow a process - it is to achieve a result: the end of terrible threats to the civilized world."
2003,GWBush,Republican,All free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We are asking them to join us, and many are doing so."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Yet the course of this Nation does not depend on the decisions of others.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Whatever action is required, whenever action is necessary, I will defend the freedom and security of the American people."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Different threats require different strategies.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In Iran, we continue to see a government that represses its people, pursues weapons of mass destruction, and supports terror."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We also see Iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty, human rights, and democracy."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Iranians, like all people, have a right to choose their own government, and determine their own destiny - and the United States supports their aspirations to live in freedom."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"On the Korean peninsula, an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Throughout the 1990s, the United States relied on a negotiated framework to keep North Korea from gaining nuclear weapons."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions.
2003,GWBush,Republican,America and the world will not be blackmailed.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"America is working with the countries of the region - South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia - to find a peaceful solution, and to show the North Korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation, economic stagnation, and continued hardship."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The North Korean regime will find respect in the world, and revival for its people, only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Our Nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula, and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"A brutal dictator, with a history of reckless aggression..with ties to terrorism... with great potential wealth...will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To spare himself, he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"For the next 12 years, he systematically violated that agreement."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"He pursued chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons - not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Almost three months ago, the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to disarm."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"He has shown instead his utter contempt for the United Nations, and for the opinion of the world."
2003,GWBush,Republican,The 108 UN weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of California.
2003,GWBush,Republican,The job of the inspectors is to verify that Iraq's regime is disarming.
2003,GWBush,Republican,It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons...lay those weapons out for the world to see...and destroy them as directed.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Nothing like this has happened.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax - enough doses to kill several million people."
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has not accounted for that material.
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin - enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure."
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has not accounted for that material.
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has given no evidence that he has destroyed it.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard, and VX nerve agent."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In such quantities, these chemical agents also could kill untold thousands."
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has not accounted for these materials.
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"U.S. intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them, despite Iraq's recent declaration denying their existence."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Saddam Hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions."
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"These are designed to produce germ warfare agents, and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities.
2003,GWBush,Republican,He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program, had a design for a nuclear weapon, and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb."
2003,GWBush,Republican,The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities.
2003,GWBush,Republican,He clearly has much to hide.
2003,GWBush,Republican,The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"To the contrary, he is deceiving."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"From intelligence sources, we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the UN inspectors - sanitizing inspection sites, and monitoring the inspectors themselves."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Iraq is blocking U-2 surveillance flights requested by the United Nations.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Real scientists have been coached by Iraqi officials on what to say.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein has ordered that scientists who cooperate with UN inspectors in disarming Iraq will be killed, along with their families."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Year after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums, taken great risks, to build and keep weapons of mass destruction - but why?"
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The only possible explanation, the only possible use he could have for those weapons, is to dominate, intimidate, or attack."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East, and create deadly havoc in the region."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And this Congress and the American people must recognize another threat.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and statements by people now in custody, reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Before September 11, 2001, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could be contained."
2003,GWBush,Republican,But chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons, and other plans - this time armed by Saddam Hussein."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"It would take just one vial, one canister, one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We will do everything in our power to make sure that day never comes.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike?"
2003,GWBush,Republican,"If this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions, all words, and all recriminations would come too late."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is not a strategy, and it is not an option."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"This dictator, who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons, has already used them on whole villages - leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained - by torturing children while their parents are made to watch.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"If this is not evil, then evil has no meaning."
2003,GWBush,Republican,And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country - your enemy is ruling your country.
2003,GWBush,Republican,And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.
2003,GWBush,Republican,The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"America will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country, our friends, and our allies."
2003,GWBush,Republican,The United States will ask the UN Security Council to convene on February 5th to consider the facts of Iraq's ongoing defiance of the world.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Secretary of State Powell will present information and intelligence about Iraq's illegal weapons programs; its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors; and its links to terrorist groups.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We will consult, but let there be no misunderstanding: If Saddam Hussein does not fully disarm, for the safety of our people, and for the peace of the world, we will lead a coalition to disarm him."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace, members of the American Armed Forces: Many of you are assembling in and near the Middle East, and some crucial hours may lie ahead."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In those hours, the success of our cause will depend on you."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Your training has prepared you.
2003,GWBush,Republican,Your honor will guide you.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"You believe in America, and America believes in you."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Sending Americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make.
2003,GWBush,Republican,The technologies of war have changed.
2003,GWBush,Republican,The risks and suffering of war have not.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"For the brave Americans who bear the risk, no victory is free from sorrow."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"This Nation fights reluctantly, because we know the cost, and we dread the days of mourning that always come."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We seek peace.
2003,GWBush,Republican,We strive for peace.
2003,GWBush,Republican,And sometimes peace must be defended.
2003,GWBush,Republican,A future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"If war is forced upon us, we will fight in a just cause and by just means - sparing, in every way we can, the innocent."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And if war is forced upon us, we will fight with the full force and might of the United States military - and we will prevail."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And as we and our coalition partners are doing in Afghanistan, we will bring to the Iraqi people food, and medicines, and supplies...and freedom."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Many challenges, abroad and at home, have arrived in a single season."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"In two years, America has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril...from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"And we go forward with confidence, because this call of history has come to the right country."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"America is a strong Nation, and honorable in the use of our strength."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We exercise power without conquest, and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"Americans are a free people, who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God;s gift to humanity."
2003,GWBush,Republican,We Americans have faith in ourselves - but not in ourselves alone.
2003,GWBush,Republican,"We do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them, placing our confidence in the loving God behind all of life, and all of history."
2003,GWBush,Republican,"May He guide us now, and may God continue to bless the United States of America."
2003,GWBush,Republican,Thank you.
2004,GWBush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE W.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 20, 2004 THE PRESIDENT: Mr."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: America this evening is a nation called to great responsibilities."
2004,GWBush,Republican,And we are rising to meet them.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"As we gather tonight, hundreds of thousands of American servicemen and women are deployed across the world in the war on terror."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By bringing hope to the oppressed, and delivering justice to the violent, they are making America more secure. (Applause.) Each day, law enforcement personnel and intelligence officers are tracking terrorist threats; analysts are examining airline passenger lists; the men and women of our new Homeland Security Department are patrolling our coasts and borders."
2004,GWBush,Republican,And their vigilance is protecting America. (Applause.) Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world.
2004,GWBush,Republican,The American economy is growing stronger.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The tax relief you passed is working. (Applause.) Tonight, members of Congress can take pride in the great works of compassion and reform that skeptics had thought impossible."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"You're raising the standards for our public schools, and you are giving our senior citizens prescription drug coverage under Medicare. (Applause.) We have faced serious challenges together, and now we face a choice: We can go forward with confidence and resolve, or we can turn back to the dangerous illusion that terrorists are not plotting and outlaw regimes are no threat to us."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We can press on with economic growth, and reforms in education and Medicare, or we can turn back to old policies and old divisions."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We've not come all this way -- through tragedy, and trial and war -- only to falter and leave our work unfinished."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Americans are rising to the tasks of history, and they expect the same from us."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"In their efforts, their enterprise, and their character, the American people are showing that the state of our union is confident and strong. (Applause.) Our greatest responsibility is the active defense of the American people."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Twenty-eight months have passed since September 11th, 2001 -- over two years without an attack on American soil."
2004,GWBush,Republican,And it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"That hope is understandable, comforting -- and false."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The killing has continued in Bali, Jakarta, Casablanca, Riyadh, Mombasa, Jerusalem, Istanbul, and Baghdad."
2004,GWBush,Republican,The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And by our will and courage, this danger will be defeated. (Applause.) Inside the United States, where the war began, we must continue to give our homeland security and law enforcement personnel every tool they need to defend us."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And one of those essential tools is the Patriot Act, which allows federal law enforcement to better share information, to track terrorists, to disrupt their cells, and to seize their assets."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"For years, we have used similar provisions to catch embezzlers and drug traffickers."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"If these methods are good for hunting criminals, they are even more important for hunting terrorists. (Applause.) Key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire next year. (Applause.) The terrorist threat will not expire on that schedule. (Applause.) Our law enforcement needs this vital legislation to protect our citizens."
2004,GWBush,Republican,You need to renew the Patriot Act. (Applause.) America is on the offensive against the terrorists who started this war.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Last March, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a mastermind of September the 11th, awoke to find himself in the custody of U.S. and Pakistani authorities."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Last August the 11th brought the capture of the terrorist Hambali, who was a key player in the attack in Indonesia that killed over 200 people."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We're tracking al Qaeda around the world, and nearly two-thirds of their known leaders have now been captured or killed."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Thousands of very skilled and determined military personnel are on the manhunt, going after the remaining killers who hide in cities and caves, and one by one, we will bring these terrorists to justice. (Applause.) As part of the offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists, and could supply them with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The United States and our allies are determined: We refuse to live in the shadow of this ultimate danger. (Applause.) The first to see our determination were the Taliban, who made Afghanistan the primary training base of al Qaeda killers."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"As of this month, that country has a new constitution, guaranteeing free elections and full participation by women."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Businesses are opening, health care centers are being established, and the boys and girls of Afghanistan are back in school."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"With the help from the new Afghan army, our coalition is leading aggressive raids against the surviving members of the Taliban and al Qaeda."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The men and women of Afghanistan are building a nation that is free and proud and fighting terror -- and America is honored to be their friend. (Applause.) Since we last met in this chamber, combat forces of the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Poland and other countries enforced the demands of the United Nations, ended the rule of Saddam Hussein, and the people of Iraq are free. (Applause.) Having broken the Baathist regime, we face a remnant of violent Saddam supporters."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Men who ran away from our troops in battle are now dispersed and attack from the shadows.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"These killers, joined by foreign terrorists, are a serious, continuing danger."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Yet we're making progress against them.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The once all-powerful ruler of Iraq was found in a hole, and now sits in a prison cell. (Applause.) Of the top 55 officials of the former regime, we have captured or killed 45."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Our forces are on the offensive, leading over 1,600 patrols a day and conducting an average of 180 raids a week."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We are dealing with these thugs in Iraq, just as surely as we dealt with Saddam Hussein's evil regime. (Applause.) The work of building a new Iraq is hard, and it is right."
2004,GWBush,Republican,And America has always been willing to do what it takes for what is right.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Last January, Iraq's only law was the whim of one brutal man."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Today our coalition is working with the Iraqi Governing Council to draft a basic law, with a bill of rights."
2004,GWBush,Republican,We're working with Iraqis and the United Nations to prepare for a transition to full Iraqi sovereignty by the end of June.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"As democracy takes hold in Iraq, the enemies of freedom will do all in their power to spread violence and fear."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"They are trying to shake the will of our country and our friends, but the United States of America will never be intimidated by thugs and assassins. (Applause.) The killers will fail, and the Iraqi people will live in freedom. (Applause.) Month by month, Iraqis are assuming more responsibility for their own security and their own future."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight we are honored to welcome one of Iraq's most respected leaders: the current President of the Iraqi Governing Council, Adnan Pachachi."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Sir, America stands with you and the Iraqi people as you build a free and peaceful nation. (Applause.) Because of American leadership and resolve, the world is changing for the better."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Last month, the leader of Libya voluntarily pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his regime's weapons of mass destruction programs, including a uranium enrichment project for nuclear weapons."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Colonel Qadhafi correctly judged that his country would be better off and far more secure without weapons of mass murder. (Applause.) Nine months of intense negotiations involving the United States and Great Britain succeeded with Libya, while 12 years of diplomacy with Iraq did not."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And one reason is clear: For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible, and no one can now doubt the word of America. (Applause.) Different threats require different strategies."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Along with nations in the region, we're insisting that North Korea eliminate its nuclear program."
2004,GWBush,Republican,America and the international community are demanding that Iran meet its commitments and not develop nuclear weapons.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"America is committed to keeping the world's most dangerous weapons out of the hands of the most dangerous regimes. (Applause.) When I came to this rostrum on September the 20th, 2001, I brought the police shield of a fallen officer, my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end."
2004,GWBush,Republican,I gave to you and to all Americans my complete commitment to securing our country and defeating our enemies.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And this pledge, given by one, has been kept by many."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"You in the Congress have provided the resources for our defense, and cast the difficult votes of war and peace."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Our closest allies have been unwavering.
2004,GWBush,Republican,America's intelligence personnel and diplomats have been skilled and tireless.
2004,GWBush,Republican,And the men and women of the American military -- they have taken the hardest duty.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We've seen their skill and their courage in armored charges and midnight raids, and lonely hours on faithful watch."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We have seen the joy when they return, and felt the sorrow when one is lost."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I've had the honor of meeting our servicemen and women at many posts, from the deck of a carrier in the Pacific to a mess hall in Baghdad."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Many of our troops are listening tonight.
2004,GWBush,Republican,And I want you and your families to know: America is proud of you.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And my administration, and this Congress, will give you the resources you need to fight and win the war on terror. (Applause.) I know that some people question if America is really in a war at all."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"They view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved mainly with law enforcement and indictments."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"After the World Trade Center was first attacked in 1993, some of the guilty were indicted and tried and convicted, and sent to prison."
2004,GWBush,Republican,But the matter was not settled.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The terrorists were still training and plotting in other nations, and drawing up more ambitious plans."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"After the chaos and carnage of September the 11th, it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United States, and war is what they got. (Applause.) Some in this chamber, and in our country, did not support the liberation of Iraq."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Objections to war often come from principled motives.
2004,GWBush,Republican,But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power.
2004,GWBush,Republican,We're seeking all the facts.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Already, the Kay Report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Had we failed to act, the dictatator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and encouraging defiance by dictators around the world."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Iraq's torture chambers would still be filled with victims, terrified and innocent."
2004,GWBush,Republican,The killing fields of Iraq -- where hundreds of thousands of men and women and children vanished into the sands -- would still be known only to the killers.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"For all who love freedom and peace, the world without Saddam Hussein's regime is a better and safer place. (Applause.) Some critics have said our duties in Iraq must be internationalized."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"This particular criticism is hard to explain to our partners in Britain, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Italy, Spain, Poland, Denmark, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, the Netherlands -- (applause) -- Norway, El Salvador, and the 17 other countries that have committed troops to Iraq. (Applause.) As we debate at home, we must never ignore the vital contributions of our international partners, or dismiss their sacrifices."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"From the beginning, America has sought international support for our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have gained much support."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"There is a difference, however, between leading a coalition of many nations, and submitting to the objections of a few."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country. (Applause.) We also hear doubts that democracy is a realistic goal for the greater Middle East, where freedom is rare."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Yet it is mistaken, and condescending, to assume that whole cultures and great religions are incompatible with liberty and self-government."
2004,GWBush,Republican,I believe that God has planted in every human heart the desire to live in freedom.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And even when that desire is crushed by tyranny for decades, it will rise again. (Applause.) As long as the Middle East remains a place of tyranny and despair and anger, it will continue to produce men and movements that threaten the safety of America and our friends."
2004,GWBush,Republican,So America is pursuing a forward strategy of freedom in the greater Middle East.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We will challenge the enemies of reform, confront the allies of terror, and expect a higher standard from our friend."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"To cut through the barriers of hateful propaganda, the Voice of America and other broadcast services are expanding their programming in Arabic and Persian -- and soon, a new television service will begin providing reliable news and information across the region."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I will send you a proposal to double the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy, and to focus its new work on the development of free elections, and free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle East."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And above all, we will finish the historic work of democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq, so those nations can light the way for others, and help transform a troubled part of the world. (Applause.) America is a nation with a mission, and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We have no desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Our aim is a democratic peace -- a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side, yet we understand our special calling: This great republic will lead the cause of freedom. (Applause.) In the last three years, adversity has also revealed the fundamental strengths of the American economy."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We have come through recession, and terrorist attack, and corporate scandals, and the uncertainties of war."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And because you acted to stimulate our economy with tax relief, this economy is strong, and growing stronger. (Applause.) You have doubled the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, begun to phase out the death tax, reduced taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, cut taxes on small businesses, and you have lowered taxes for every American who pays income taxes."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Americans took those dollars and put them to work, driving this economy forward."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The pace of economic growth in the third quarter of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years; new home construction, the highest in almost 20 years; home ownership rates, the highest ever."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Manufacturing activity is increasing.
2004,GWBush,Republican,Inflation is low.
2004,GWBush,Republican,Interest rates are low.
2004,GWBush,Republican,Exports are growing.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Productivity is high, and jobs are on the rise. (Applause.) These numbers confirm that the American people are using their money far better than government would have -- and you were right to return it. (Applause.) America's growing economy is also a changing economy."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"As technology transforms the way almost every job is done, America becomes more productive, and workers need new skills."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Much of our job growth will be found in high-skilled fields like health care and biotechnology.
2004,GWBush,Republican,So we must respond by helping more Americans gain the skills to find good jobs in our new economy.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"All skills begin with the basics of reading and math, which are supposed to be learned in the early grades of our schools."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Yet for too long, for too many children, those skills were never mastered."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By passing the No Child Left Behind Act, you have made the expectation of literacy the law of our country."
2004,GWBush,Republican,We're providing more funding for our schools -- a 36-percent increase since 2001.
2004,GWBush,Republican,We're requiring higher standards.
2004,GWBush,Republican,We are regularly testing every child on the fundamentals.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We are reporting results to parents, and making sure they have better options when schools are not performing."
2004,GWBush,Republican,We are making progress toward excellence for every child in America. (Applause.) But the status quo always has defenders.
2004,GWBush,Republican,Some want to undermine the No Child Left Behind Act by weakening standards and accountability.
2004,GWBush,Republican,Yet the results we require are really a matter of common sense: We expect third graders to read and do math at the third grade level -- and that's not asking too much.
2004,GWBush,Republican,Testing is the only way to identify and help students who are falling behind.
2004,GWBush,Republican,This nation will not go back to the days of simply shuffling children along from grade to grade without them learning the basics.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I refuse to give up on any child -- and the No Child Left Behind Act is opening the door of opportunity to all of America's children. (Applause.) At the same time, we must ensure that older students and adults can gain the skills they need to find work now."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Many of the fastest growing occupations require strong math and science preparation, and training beyond the high school level."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight, I propose a series of measures called Jobs for the 21st Century."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"This program will provide extra help to middle and high school students who fall behind in reading and math, expand advanced placement programs in low-income schools, invite math and science professionals from the private sector to teach part-time in our high schools."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I propose larger Pell grants for students who prepare for college with demanding courses in high school. (Applause.) I propose increasing our support for America's fine community colleges, so they can -- (applause.) I do so, so they can train workers for industries that are creating the most new jobs."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By all these actions, we'll help more and more Americans to join in the growing prosperity of our country."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Job training is important, and so is job creation."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We must continue to pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda. (Applause.) Congress has some unfinished business on the issue of taxes."
2004,GWBush,Republican,The tax reductions you passed are set to expire.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Unless you act -- (applause) -- unless you act -- unless you act, the unfair tax on marriage will go back up."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Unless you act, millions of families will be charged $300 more in federal taxes for every child."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Unless you act, small businesses will pay higher taxes."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Unless you act, the death tax will eventually come back to life."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Unless you act, Americans face a tax increase."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"What Congress has given, the Congress should not take away."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"For the sake of job growth, the tax cuts you passed should be permanent. (Applause.) Our agenda for jobs and growth must help small business owners and employees with relief from needless federal regulation, and protect them from junk and frivolous lawsuits. (Applause.) Consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run -- so I urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system, promote conservation, and make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy. (Applause.) My administration is promoting free and fair trade to open up new markets for America's entrepreneurs and manufacturers and farmers -- to create jobs for American workers."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Younger workers should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account. (Applause.) We should make the Social Security system a source of ownership for the American people. (Applause.) And we should limit the burden of government on this economy by acting as good stewards of taxpayers' dollars. (Applause.) In two weeks, I will send you a budget that funds the war, protects the homeland, and meets important domestic needs, while limiting the growth in discretionary spending to less than 4 percent. (Applause.) This will require that Congress focus on priorities, cut wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years. (Applause.) Tonight, I also ask you to reform our immigration laws so they reflect our values and benefit our economy."
2004,GWBush,Republican,I propose a new temporary worker program to match willing foreign workers with willing employers when no Americans can be found to fill the job.
2004,GWBush,Republican,This reform will be good for our economy because employers will find needed workers in an honest and orderly system.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"A temporary worker program will help protect our homeland, allowing Border Patrol and law enforcement to focus on true threats to our national security."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I oppose amnesty, because it would encourage further illegal immigration, and unfairly reward those who break our laws."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"My temporary worker program will preserve the citizenship path for those who respect the law, while bringing millions of hardworking men and women out from the shadows of American life. (Applause.) Our nation's health care system, like our economy, is also in a time of change."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Amazing medical technologies are improving and saving lives.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"This dramatic progress has brought its own challenge, in the rising costs of medical care and health insurance."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Members of Congress, we must work together to help control those costs and extend the benefits of modern medicine throughout our country. (Applause.) Meeting these goals requires bipartisan effort, and two months ago, you showed the way."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By strengthening Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit, you kept a basic commitment to our seniors: You are giving them the modern medicine they deserve. (Applause.) Starting this year, under the law you passed, seniors can choose to receive a drug discount card, saving them 10 to 25 percent off the retail price of most prescription drugs -- and millions of low-income seniors can get an additional $600 to buy medicine."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Beginning next year, seniors will have new coverage for preventive screenings against diabetes and heart disease, and seniors just entering Medicare can receive wellness exams."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"In January of 2006, seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"For a monthly premium of about $35, most seniors who do not have that coverage today can expect to see their drug bills cut roughly in half."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Under this reform, senior citizens will be able to keep their Medicare just as it is, or they can choose a Medicare plan that fits them best -- just as you, as members of Congress, can choose an insurance plan that meets your needs."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And starting this year, millions of Americans will be able to save money tax-free for their medical expenses in a health savings account. (Applause.) I signed this measure proudly, and any attempt to limit the choices of our seniors, or to take away their prescription drug coverage under Medicare, will meet my veto. (Applause.) On the critical issue of health care, our goal is to ensure that Americans can choose and afford private health care coverage that best fits their individual needs."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"To make insurance more affordable, Congress must act to address rapidly rising health care costs."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Small businesses should be able to band together and negotiate for lower insurance rates, so they can cover more workers with health insurance."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I urge you to pass association health plans. (Applause.) I ask you to give lower-income Americans a refundable tax credit that would allow millions to buy their own basic health insurance. (Applause.) By computerizing health records, we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs, and improve care."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"To protect the doctor-patient relationship, and keep good doctors doing good work, we must eliminate wasteful and frivolous medical lawsuits. (Applause.) And tonight I propose that individuals who buy catastrophic health care coverage, as part of our new health savings accounts, be allowed to deduct 100 percent of the premiums from their taxes. (Applause.) A government-run health care system is the wrong prescription. (Applause.) By keeping costs under control, expanding access, and helping more Americans afford coverage, we will preserve the system of private medicine that makes America's health care the best in the world. (Applause.) We are living in a time of great change -- in our world, in our economy, in science and medicine."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Yet some things endure -- courage and compassion, reverence and integrity, respect for differences of faith and race."
2004,GWBush,Republican,The values we try to live by never change.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And they are instilled in us by fundamental institutions, such as families and schools and religious congregations."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"These institutions, these unseen pillars of civilization, must remain strong in America, and we will defend them."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We must stand with our families to help them raise healthy, responsible children."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"When it comes to helping children make right choices, there is work for all of us to do."
2004,GWBush,Republican,One of the worst decisions our children can make is to gamble their lives and futures on drugs.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Our government is helping parents confront this problem with aggressive education, treatment, and law enforcement."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Drug use in high school has declined by 11 percent over the last two years.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Four hundred thousand fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001. (Applause.) In my budget, I proposed new funding to continue our aggressive, community-based strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Drug testing in our schools has proven to be an effective part of this effort.
2004,GWBush,Republican,So tonight I proposed an additional $23 million for schools that want to use drug testing as a tool to save children's lives.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The aim here is not to punish children, but to send them this message: We love you, and we don't want to lose you. (Applause.) To help children make right choices, they need good examples."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Athletics play such an important role in our society, but, unfortunately, some in professional sports are not setting much of an example."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The use of performance-enhancing drugs like steroids in baseball, football, and other sports is dangerous, and it sends the wrong message -- that there are shortcuts to accomplishment, and that performance is more important than character."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight I call on team owners, union representatives, coaches, and players to take the lead, to send the right signal, to get tough, and to get rid of steroids now. (Applause.) To encourage right choices, we must be willing to confront the dangers young people face -- even when they're difficult to talk about."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Each year, about 3 million teenagers contract sexually-transmitted diseases that can harm them, or kill them, or prevent them from ever becoming parents."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"In my budget, I propose a grassroots campaign to help inform families about these medical risks."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We will double federal funding for abstinence programs, so schools can teach this fact of life: Abstinence for young people is the only certain way to avoid sexually-transmitted diseases. (Applause.) Decisions children now make can affect their health and character for the rest of their lives."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"All of us -- parents and schools and government -- must work together to counter the negative influence of the culture, and to send the right messages to our children."
2004,GWBush,Republican,A strong America must also value the institution of marriage.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I believe we should respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"That statute protects marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage. (Applause.) The outcome of this debate is important -- and so is the way we conduct it.
2004,GWBush,Republican,The same moral tradition that defines marriage also teaches that each individual has dignity and value in God's sight. (Applause.) It's also important to strengthen our communities by unleashing the compassion of America's religious institutions.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Religious charities of every creed are doing some of the most vital work in our country -- mentoring children, feeding the hungry, taking the hand of the lonely."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Yet government has often denied social service grants and contracts to these groups, just because they have a cross or a Star of David or a crescent on the wall."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By executive order, I have opened billions of dollars in grant money to competition that includes faith-based charities."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I ask you to codify this into law, so people of faith can know that the law will never discriminate against them again. (Applause.) In the past, we've worked together to bring mentors to children of prisoners, and provide treatment for the addicted, and help for the homeless."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I ask you to consider another group of Americans in need of help.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"This year, some 600,000 inmates will be released from prison back into society."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"We know from long experience that if they can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to commit crime and return to prison."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight, I propose a four-year, $300 million prisoner re-entry initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. (Applause.) America is the land of second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life. (Applause.) For all Americans, the last three years have brought tests we did not ask for, and achievements shared by all."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"By our actions, we have shown what kind of nation we are."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"In grief, we have found the grace to go on."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"In challenge, we rediscovered the courage and daring of a free people."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"In victory, we have shown the noble aims and good heart of America."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And having come this far, we sense that we live in a time set apart."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"I've been witness to the character of the people of America, who have shown calm in times of danger, compassion for one another, and toughness for the long haul."
2004,GWBush,Republican,All of us have been partners in a great enterprise.
2004,GWBush,Republican,And even some of the youngest understand that we are living in historic times.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Last month a girl in Lincoln, Rhode Island, sent me a letter."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"It began, ""Dear George W."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Bush.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"If there's anything you know, I, Ashley Pearson, age 10, can do to help anyone, please send me a letter and tell me what I can do to save our country."" She added this P.S.: ""If you can send a letter to the troops, please put, 'Ashley Pearson believes in you.'"" (Applause.) Tonight, Ashley, your message to our troops has just been conveyed."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And, yes, you have some duties yourself."
2004,GWBush,Republican,"Study hard in school, listen to your mom or dad, help someone in need, and when you and your friends see a man or woman in uniform, say, ""thank you."" (Applause.) And, Ashley, while you do your part, all of us here in this great chamber will do our best to keep you and the rest of America safe and free. (Applause.) My fellow citizens, we now move forward, with confidence and faith."
2004,GWBush,Republican,Our nation is strong and steadfast.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of all mankind."
2004,GWBush,Republican,The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable -- and it is not carried forward by our power alone.
2004,GWBush,Republican,We can trust in that greater power who guides the unfolding of the years.
2004,GWBush,Republican,"And in all that is to come, we can know that His purposes are just and true."
2004,GWBush,Republican,May God continue to bless America. (Applause.)
2005,GWBush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE W.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION February 2, 2005 9:10 P.M."
2005,GWBush,Republican,EST THE PRESIDENT: Mr.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, fellow citizens: As a new Congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight that is a privilege we share with newly-elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq. (Applause.) Two weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all."
2005,GWBush,Republican,This evening I will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world -- the state of our union is confident and strong. (Applause.) Our generation has been blessed -- by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Now, as we see a little gray in the mirror -- or a lot of gray -- (laughter) -- and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What will be the state of their union?"
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Members of Congress, the choices we make together will answer that question."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what Americans have always done, and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren. (Applause.) First, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely."
2005,GWBush,Republican,America's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In the past four years, we provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history, and in the last year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs. (Applause.) When action was needed, the Congress delivered -- and the nation is grateful."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Now we must add to these achievements.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the economic leader of the world. (Applause.) America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government."
2005,GWBush,Republican,I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. (Applause.) My budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"The principle here is clear: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all. (Applause.) To make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Under the No Child Left Behind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're closing the achievement gap for minority students."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career, by reforming our job training system and strengthening America's community colleges."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And we'll make it easier for Americans to afford a college education, by increasing the size of Pell Grants. (Applause.) To make our economy stronger and more competitive, America must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits. (Applause.) Justice is distorted, and our economy is held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous asbestos claims -- and I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year. (Applause.) To make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable, and give families greater access to good coverage -- (applause) -- and more control over their health decisions. (Applause.) I ask Congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor country, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees -- (applause) -- expanded health savings accounts -- (applause) -- and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need. (Applause.) To keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. (Applause.) Nearly four years ago, I submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home -- including safe, clean nuclear energy. (Applause.) My Clear Skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. (Applause.) And my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology -- from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as ethanol. (Applause.) Four years of debate is enough: I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America more secure and less dependent on foreign energy. (Applause.) All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs -- but they are just the beginning of our duty."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"To build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Year after year, Americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code."
2005,GWBush,Republican,I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And when their recommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to all. (Applause.) America's immigration system is also outdated -- unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists. (Applause.) One of America's most important institutions -- a symbol of the trust between generations -- is also in need of wise and effective reform."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Social Security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century. (Applause.) The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And so we must join together to strengthen and save Social Security. (Applause.) Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement -- and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"I have a message for every American who is 55 or older: Do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not change in any way. (Applause.) For younger workers, the Social Security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Social Security was created decades ago, for a very different era."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In those days, people did not live as long."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Benefits were much lower than they are today.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And a half-century ago, about sixteen workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not have foreseen.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In today's world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing benefits longer."
2005,GWBush,Republican,And those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And instead of sixteen workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it's only about three workers."
2005,GWBush,Republican,And over the next few decades that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"With each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"So here is the result: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will be paying out more than it takes in."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"For example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat -- and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other government programs."
2005,GWBush,Republican,I recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"But those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"If you have a five-year-old, you're already concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"If you've got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter."
2005,GWBush,Republican,And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress. (Applause.) You and I share a responsibility.
2005,GWBush,Republican,We must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of Social Security once and for all.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees.
2005,GWBush,Republican,Former Congressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"During the 1990s, my predecessor, President Clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Former Senator John Breaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits.
2005,GWBush,Republican,The late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated.
2005,GWBush,Republican,All these ideas are on the table.
2005,GWBush,Republican,I know that none of these reforms would be easy.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"But we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics. (Applause.) I will work with members of Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"I will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer. (Applause.) We must, however, be guided by some basic principles."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We must make Social Security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day."
2005,GWBush,Republican,We must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes.
2005,GWBush,Republican,We must ensure that lower-income Americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement.
2005,GWBush,Republican,We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers."
2005,GWBush,Republican,And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. (Applause.) Here is how the idea works.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"If you're a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver -- and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In addition, you'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and -- or grandchildren."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away. (Applause.) The goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts."
2005,GWBush,Republican,We'll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds.
2005,GWBush,Republican,We'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees.
2005,GWBush,Republican,We'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional Social Security benefits."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal retirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the Thrift Savings Plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly-based investment funds."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"It's time to extend the same security, and choice, and ownership to young Americans. (Applause.) Our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"So many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be re-defined by activist judges."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"For the good of families, children, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. (Applause.) Because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities -- and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of the National Institutes of Health. (Applause.) To build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others."
2005,GWBush,Republican,We should all be able to agree -- (applause) -- we should all be able to agree on some clear standards.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"I will work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity. (Applause.) America will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. (Applause.) As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy, and are well-qualified to serve on the bench -- and I have done so. (Applause.) The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote. (Applause.) Because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of America."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. (Applause.) Taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.) Because HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, I ask you to reauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention, and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease. (Applause.) And as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, African American men and women. (Applause.) Because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In America we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit -- so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to prevent wrongful conviction. (Applause.) Soon I will send to Congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. (Applause.) Our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America that is safe from danger, and protected by peace."
2005,GWBush,Republican,We will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy -- and chief among them is freedom from fear.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We've created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half-million first responders."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all. (Applause.) Our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing."
2005,GWBush,Republican,The al Qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders -- but many of its top commanders have been removed.
2005,GWBush,Republican,There are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists -- but their number has declined.
2005,GWBush,Republican,There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction -- but no longer without attention and without consequence.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all -- and we will stay on the offensive against them, until the fight is won. (Applause.) Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror -- and I thank the Congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"During this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. (Applause.) Other nations around the globe have stood with us."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In Afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In Iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union provided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a mission to help train Iraqi officers."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We're cooperating with 60 governments in the Proliferation Security Initiative, to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials."
2005,GWBush,Republican,We're working closely with the governments in Asia to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained al Qaeda terrorists."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In the next four years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. (Applause.) In the long-term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"If whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other free nations for decades."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace hatred with hope, is the force of human freedom. (Applause.) Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the ""evil principle"" of democracy."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. (Applause.) The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else."
2005,GWBush,Republican,That is one of the main differences between us and our enemies.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"They seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. (Applause.) That advance has great momentum in our time -- shown by women voting in Afghanistan, and Palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of Ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president."
2005,GWBush,Republican,We are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And in the coming years, we will add to that story. (Applause.) The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Tomorrow morning, Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will take her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"She will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"To promote this democracy, I will ask Congress for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security reforms."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"The goal of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace, is within reach -- and America will help them achieve that goal. (Applause.) To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United States will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom."
2005,GWBush,Republican,Hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain.
2005,GWBush,Republican,The government of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And the great and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the Middle East, can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle East. (Applause.) To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Syria still allows its territory, and parts of Lebanon, to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"You have passed, and we are applying, the Syrian Accountability Act -- and we expect the Syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom. (Applause.) Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror -- pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end its support for terror."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And to the Iranian people, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with you. (Applause.) Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the Middle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"That country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home. (Applause.) And the victory of freedom in Iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty -- as they showed the world last Sunday. (Applause.) Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new Transitional National Assembly."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"A young woman in Baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"She said, ""Hearing those explosions, it occurred to me -- the insurgents are weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"So I got my husband, and I got my parents, and we all came out and voted together."" Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for millions of Iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all. (Applause.) One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb al-Suhail."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"She says of her country, ""We were occupied for 35 years by Saddam Hussein."
2005,GWBush,Republican,That was the real occupation.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Thank you to the American people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers."" Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Three days ago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country -- and we are honored that she is with us tonight. (Applause.) The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and will continue to attack it."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Yet, the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of Iraqis, expressed in free elections."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people. (Applause.) We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom, and to write their own history."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"As Prime Minister Allawi said in his speech to Congress last September, ""Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible."" That is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in Iraq."
2005,GWBush,Republican,The new political situation in Iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in consultation with the Iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces -- forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"As those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, America and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In the end, Iraqis must be able to defend their own country -- and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, ""Tell America not to abandon us."" He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq will make America safer for generations to come. (Applause.) We will not set an artificial timetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We are in Iraq to achieve a result: A country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"And when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have earned. (Applause.) Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We have given them training and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every American proud. (Applause.) The volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they're making our nation more secure."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. (Applause.) And we have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of Pflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"His mom, Janet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a Marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"She wrote, ""When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like I had since he was born."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job, Mom."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Now it is my turn to protect you.'"" Ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom's defenders, and our military families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet and Bill Norwood. (Applause.) In these four years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of victory."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us."
2005,GWBush,Republican,The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"We are all part of a great venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, ""Each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth."" And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born."
2005,GWBush,Republican,The abolition of slavery was only a dream -- until it was fulfilled.
2005,GWBush,Republican,The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream -- until it was achieved.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"The fall of imperial communism was only a dream -- until, one day, it was accomplished."
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence."
2005,GWBush,Republican,The road of Providence is uneven and unpredictable -- yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.
2005,GWBush,Republican,"Thank you, and may God bless America. (Applause.) END 10:03 P.M."
2005,GWBush,Republican,EST
2006,GWBush,Republican,PRESIDENT GEORGE W.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"BUSH'S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION January 31, 2006 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you all."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Mr.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. (Applause.) President George W."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Bush reacts to applause during his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"White House photo by Eric DraperEvery time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we've seen together."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to serve with you.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger. (Applause.) In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting -- yet it ends in danger and decline."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership -- so the United States of America will continue to lead. (Applause.) Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we seek the end of tyranny in our world."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In reality, the future security of America depends on it."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer -- so we will act boldly in freedom's cause. (Applause.) Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Today, there are 122."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And we're writing a new chapter in the story of self-government -- with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran -- because the demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom, as well. (Applause.) President George W."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Bush delivers his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"White House photo by Eric Draper No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it."
2006,GWBush,Republican,And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam -- the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.
2006,GWBush,Republican,Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder -- and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"When they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"But they have miscalculated: We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it. (Applause.) In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone."
2006,GWBush,Republican,They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores.
2006,GWBush,Republican,There is no peace in retreat.
2006,GWBush,Republican,And there is no honor in retreat.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"By allowing radical Islam to work its will -- by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself -- we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil. (Applause.) America rejects the false comfort of isolationism."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We remain on the offensive against terror networks.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We have killed or captured many of their leaders -- and for the others, their day will come."
2006,GWBush,Republican,President George W.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Bush greets members of Congress after his State of the Union Address at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"White House photo by Eric Draper We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We're on the offensive in Iraq, with a clear plan for victory."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"First, we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Second, we're continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And, third, we're striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom. (Applause.) Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal."
2006,GWBush,Republican,But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"At the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces."
2006,GWBush,Republican,I am confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning. (Applause.) The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"As we make progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels -- but those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C. (Applause.) Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We've adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Along the way, we have benefitted from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of Congress of both parties."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Yet, there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure. (Applause.) Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and second-guessing is not a strategy. (Applause.) With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military in this vital mission. (Applause.) Laura Bush is applauded as she is introduced Tuesday evening, Jan. 31, 2006 during the State of the Union Address at United States Capitol in Washington."
2006,GWBush,Republican,White House photo by Eric Draper Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices -- and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"They know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb."
2006,GWBush,Republican,And those who know the costs also know the stakes.
2006,GWBush,Republican,Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every American."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Here is what Dan wrote: ""I know what honor is. ..."
2006,GWBush,Republican,It has been an honor to protect and serve all of you.
2006,GWBush,Republican,I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to....
2006,GWBush,Republican,Never falter!
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting."" Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Welcome. (Applause.) Our nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation's uniform -- and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military families. (Applause.) Our offensive against terror involves more than military action."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change."
2006,GWBush,Republican,So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, and protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote."
2006,GWBush,Republican,The great people of Egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election -- and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism.
2006,GWBush,Republican,The Palestinian people have voted in elections.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace. (Applause.) Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform -- now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity. (Applause.) President George W."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Bush waves toward the upper visitors gallery of the House Chamber following his State of the Union remarks Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2006 at the United States Capitol."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"White House photo by Eric Draper The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon -- and that must come to an end. (Applause.) The Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. (Applause.) America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you, and we respect your country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran. (Applause.) To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress, and fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, and organized crime, and human trafficking, and the drug trade."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"For people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,I urge members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America.
2006,GWBush,Republican,Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home.
2006,GWBush,Republican,The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"These men and women are dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. (Applause.) They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime -- so I ask you to reauthorize the Patriot Act. (Applause.) It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to al Qaeda operatives overseas.
2006,GWBush,Republican,But we did not know about their plans until it was too late.
2006,GWBush,Republican,So to prevent another attack -- based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute -- I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al Qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from America.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have, and federal courts have approved the use of that authority."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Appropriate members of Congress have been kept informed.
2006,GWBush,Republican,The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks.
2006,GWBush,Republican,It remains essential to the security of America.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"If there are people inside our country who are talking with al Qaeda, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. (Applause.) In all these areas -- from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions -- we need the support of our friends and allies."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"To draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act."
2006,GWBush,Republican,The only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world.
2006,GWBush,Republican,Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"American leaders -- from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan -- rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on the march."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy -- a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties, who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress."
2006,GWBush,Republican,And tonight I ask for yours.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom. (Applause.) Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Our economy is healthy and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In the last two-and-a-half years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs -- more than Japan and the European Union combined. (Applause.) Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors, like China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people's fears."
2006,GWBush,Republican,So we're seeing some old temptations return.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy -- even though this economy could not function without them. (Applause.) All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction -- toward a stagnant and second-rate economy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and invest."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses, and families -- and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. (Applause.) Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Because America needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"I urge the Congress to act responsibly, and make the tax cuts permanent. (Applause.) Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Every year of my presidency, we've reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending, and last year you passed bills that cut this spending."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"This year my budget will cut it again, and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"By passing these reforms, we will save the American taxpayer another $14 billion next year, and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. (Applause.) I am pleased that members of Congress are working on earmark reform, because the federal budget has too many special interest projects. (Applause.) And we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto. (Applause.) We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60, including two of my Dad's favorite people -- me and President Clinton. (Laughter.) This milestone is more than a personal crisis -- (laughter) -- it is a national challenge."
2006,GWBush,Republican,The retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"By 2030, spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And that will present future Congresses with impossible choices -- staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security -- (applause) -- yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away. (Applause.) And every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight, I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"This commission should include members of Congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan solutions."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We need to put aside partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved. (Applause.) Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that Americans make and grow.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"One out of every five factory jobs in America is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"With open markets and a level playing field, no one can out-produce or out-compete the American worker. (Applause.) Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Our nation needs orderly and secure borders. (Applause.) To meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. (Applause.) And we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty, allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling and crime at the border. (Applause.) Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care. (Applause.) Our government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. (Applause.) For all Americans -- for all Americans, we must confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, and help people afford the insurance coverage they need. (Applause.) We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology, to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We will strengthen health savings accounts -- making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get. (Applause.) We will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance. (Applause.) And because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice -- leaving women in nearly 1,500 American counties without a single OB/GYN -- I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year. (Applause.) Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And here we have a serious problem: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world."
2006,GWBush,Republican,The best way to break this addiction is through technology.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources -- and we are on the threshold of incredible advances."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight, I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative -- a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research -- at the Department of Energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants, revolutionary solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy. (Applause.) We must also change how we power our automobiles."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We'll also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn, but from wood chips and stalks, or switch grass."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years. (Applause.) Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the Middle East by 2025. (Applause.) By applying the talent and technology of America, this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a petroleum-based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past. (Applause.) And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hardworking, ambitious people -- and we're going to keep that edge."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy, and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math and science. (Applause.) First, I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"This funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit -- (applause) -- to encourage bolder private-sector initiatives in technology."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"With more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life -- and ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come. (Applause.) Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"We've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world. (Applause.) Preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and together we will show the world what the American people can achieve."
2006,GWBush,Republican,America is a great force for freedom and prosperity.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s.
2006,GWBush,Republican,Welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade.
2006,GWBush,Republican,Drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"There are fewer abortions in America than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row. (Applause.) These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation -- a revolution of conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Government has played a role.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Wise policies, such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record. (Applause.) Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic institutions."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"They're concerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"They worry about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by treatable diseases."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that America is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel."
2006,GWBush,Republican,The American people know better than that.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We have proven the pessimists wrong before -- and we will do it again. (Applause.) A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law.
2006,GWBush,Republican,The Supreme Court now has two superb new members -- new members on its bench: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. (Applause.) I thank the Senate for confirming both of them.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench. (Applause.) Today marks the official retirement of a very special American."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"For 24 years of faithful service to our nation, the United States is grateful to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. (Applause.) A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every life."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research: human cloning in all its forms, creating or implanting embryos for experiments, creating human-animal hybrids, and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Human life is a gift from our Creator -- and that gift should never be discarded, devalued or put up for sale. (Applause.) A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust. (Applause.) Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of Washington -- I support your efforts."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility -- and that is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray. (Applause.) As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of America in our compassion and care for one another."
2006,GWBush,Republican,A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child -- and this good work is being led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. (Applause.) This year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school, so more of America's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams."
2006,GWBush,Republican,A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency -- and stays at it until they're back on their feet.
2006,GWBush,Republican,So far the federal government has committed $85 billion to the people of the Gulf Coast and New Orleans.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We're removing debris and repairing highways and rebuilding stronger levees.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We're providing business loans and housing assistance.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Yet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"The answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child, and job skills that bring upward mobility, and more opportunities to own a home and start a business."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity. (Applause.) A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be prevented, and treated, and defeated."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"More than a million Americans live with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"I ask Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act, and provide new funding to states, so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America. (Applause.) We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African American churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end the stigma of AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in America. (Applause.) Fellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of consequence."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing."
2006,GWBush,Republican,Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma, and achieved only half a victory over segregation."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"The United States could have accepted the permanent division of Europe, and been complicit in the oppression of others."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: Will we turn back, or finish well?"
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage."
2006,GWBush,Republican,"Like Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well."
2006,GWBush,Republican,We will lead freedom's advance.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We will compete and excel in the global economy.
2006,GWBush,Republican,We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land.
2006,GWBush,Republican,"And so we move forward -- optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of the victories to come."
2006,GWBush,Republican,May God bless America. (Applause.)
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 23, 2007 Thank you very much."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And tonight I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In his day, the late Congressman Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., from Baltimore, Maryland, saw Presidents Roosevelt and Truman at this rostrum."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy, presiding tonight as Speaker of the House of Representatives."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Congratulations, Madam Speaker."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Two Members of the House and Senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of Senator Tim Johnson and Congressman Charlie Norwood."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: The rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour when decisions are hard and courage is needed."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway and others that are ours to begin.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In all of this, much is asked of us."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies and the wisdom to face them together.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Some in this Chamber are new to the House and the Senate, and I congratulate the Democrat majority."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Congress has changed, but not our responsibilities."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Each of us is guided by our own convictions, and to these we must stay faithful."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Yet we're all held to the same standards and called to serve the same good purposes: to extend this Nation's prosperity, to spend the people's money wisely, to solve problems, not leave them to future generations, to guard America against all evil, and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We're not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Like many before us, we can work through our differences, and we can achieve big things for the American people."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Our citizens don't much care which side of the aisle we sit on, as long as we're willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Our job is to make life better for our fellow Americans and to help them build a future of hope and opportunity, and this is the business before us tonight."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"A future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy, and that is what we have."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We're now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs so far."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Unemployment is low; inflation is low; wages are rising.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"This economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government but with more enterprise."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Next week, I'll deliver a full report on the state of our economy."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this Congress.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"First, we must balance the Federal budget."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We can do so without raising taxes.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"What we need is spending discipline in Washington, DC."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009 and met that goal 3 years ahead of schedule.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Now let us take the next step.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In the coming weeks, I will submit a budget that eliminates the Federal deficit within the next 5 years."
2007,GWBush,Republican,I ask you to make the same commitment.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the Federal Government, and we can balance the Federal budget."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Next, there is the matter of earmarks."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"These special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour, when not even C-SPAN is watching. [Laughter] In 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Even worse, over 90 percent of the earmarks never make it to the floor of the House and Senate."
2007,GWBush,Republican,They are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"You didn't vote them into law, I didn't sign them into law, yet they're treated as if they have the force of law."
2007,GWBush,Republican,The time has come to end this practice.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"So let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in Congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And finally, to keep this economy strong, we must take on the challenge of entitlements."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Yet we're failing in that duty.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Everyone in this Chamber knows this to be true, yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act."
2007,GWBush,Republican,So let us work together and do it now.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"With enough good sense and good will, you and I can fix Medicare and Medicaid and save Social Security."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Spreading opportunity and hope in America also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding schools accountable for results."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Now the task is to build on the success without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We must increase funds for students who struggle and make sure these children get the special help they need.
2007,GWBush,Republican,And we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"The No Child Left Behind Act has worked for America's children, and I ask Congress to reauthorize this good law."
2007,GWBush,Republican,A future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"When it comes to health care, Government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children, and we will meet those responsibilities."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For all other Americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"But many Americans cannot afford a health insurance policy, and so tonight I propose two new initiatives to help more Americans afford their own insurance."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"First, I propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax—or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"With this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"At the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For Americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings, $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And for the millions of other Americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic, private health insurance plan within their reach."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Changing the Tax Code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans.
2007,GWBush,Republican,My second proposal is to help the States that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured.
2007,GWBush,Republican,States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick.
2007,GWBush,Republican,I have asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Congress to take existing Federal funds and use them to create Affordable Choices grants.
2007,GWBush,Republican,These grants would give our Nation's Governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need.
2007,GWBush,Republican,There are many other ways that Congress can help.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We need to expand health savings accounts.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We need to help small businesses through association health plans.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We will encourage price transparency.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we need to pass medical liability reform."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are not made by government and insurance companies but by patients and their doctors."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of America, with laws that are fair and borders that are secure."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"When laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"To secure our border, we're doubling the size of the Border Patrol and funding new infrastructure and technology."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border, and that requires a temporary-worker program."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"As a result, they won't have to try to sneak in, and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We'll enforce our immigration laws at the worksite and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there's no excuse left for violating the law."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Convictions run deep in this Capitol when it comes to immigration.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass and I can sign comprehensive immigration reform into law."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps America's economy running and America's environment clean.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For too long, our Nation has been dependent on foreign oil."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes and to terrorists who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments and raise the price of oil and do great harm to our economy.
2007,GWBush,Republican,It's in our vital interest to diversify America's energy supply.
2007,GWBush,Republican,The way forward is through technology.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We must continue changing the way America generates electric power by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol, using everything from wood chips to grasses to agricultural wastes."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in Washington and the strong response of the market."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And now even more dramatic advances are within reach.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Tonight I ask Congress to join me in pursuing a great goal.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Let us build on the work we've done and reduce gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"When we do that, we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the Middle East."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"To reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017, and that is nearly five times the current target."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"At the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks, and conserve up to 81⁄2 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it's not going to eliminate it."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And to further protect America against severe disruptions to our oil supply, I ask Congress to double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve."
2007,GWBush,Republican,America is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"A future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice."
2007,GWBush,Republican,The lives of our citizens across our Nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our Federal courts.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We have a shared obligation to ensure that the Federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"As President, I have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the Federal bench, and the United States Senate has a duty as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing and a prompt up-or-down vote on the Senate floor."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We've had time to take stock of our situation.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We've added many critical protections to guard the homeland.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We know with certainty that the horrors of that September morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us, unless we stop them."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror, we must take the fight to the enemy."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"From the start, America and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"The enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We stopped an Al Qaida plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We broke up a Southeast Asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the United States.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We uncovered an Al Qaida cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against America.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And just last August, British authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for America over the Atlantic Ocean."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy.
2007,GWBush,Republican,The evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And so long as that's the case, America is still a nation at war."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In the mind of the terrorists, this war began well before September the 11th and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And these past 5 years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Al Qaida and its followers are Sunni extremists possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"They preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions.
2007,GWBush,Republican,They want to overthrow moderate governments and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"By killing and terrorizing Americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty."
2007,GWBush,Republican,They would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Listen to this warning from the late terrorist Zarqawi: ""We will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse."" Usama bin Laden declared: ""Death is better than living on this Earth with the unbelievers among us."" These men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the Islamist radical movement."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from Shi'a extremists who are just as hostile to America and are also determined to dominate the Middle East."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Many are known to take direction from the regime in Iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like Hizballah, a group second only to Al Qaida in the American lives it has taken."
2007,GWBush,Republican,The Shi'a and Sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Whatever slogans they chant when they slaughter the innocent, they have the same wicked purposes."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"They want to kill Americans, kill democracy in the Middle East, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In the sixth year since our Nation was attacked, I wish I could report to you that the dangers have ended."
2007,GWBush,Republican,They have not.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And so it remains the policy of this Government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the American people."
2007,GWBush,Republican,This war is more than a clash of arms; it is a decisive ideological struggle.
2007,GWBush,Republican,And the security of our Nation is in the balance.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"To prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"What every terrorist fears most is human freedom: societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies, and most will choose a better way when they're given a chance."
2007,GWBush,Republican,So we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy.
2007,GWBush,Republican,The great question of our day is whether America will help men and women in the Middle East to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And I say, for the sake of our own security, we must."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In the last 2 years, we've seen the desire for liberty in the broader Middle East, and we have been sobered by the enemy's fierce reaction."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In 2005, the world watched as the citizens of Lebanon raised the banner of the Cedar Revolution."
2007,GWBush,Republican,They drove out the Syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In 2005, the people of Afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And in 2005, the Iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic Constitution in the Arab world, and then electing a Government under that Constitution."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million Iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"A thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and, in 2006, they struck back."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In Lebanon, assassins took the life of Pierre Gemayel, a prominent participant in the Cedar Revolution."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Hizballah terrorists, with support from Syria and Iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine Lebanon's legitimately elected Government."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In Afghanistan, Taliban and Al Qaida fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging Afghan and NATO forces."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In Iraq, Al Qaida and other Sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in Shi'a Islam, the Golden Mosque of Samarra."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"This atrocity, directed at a Muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from Iraqi Shi'a, and it succeeded."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Radical Shi'a elements, some of whom receive support from Iran, formed death squads."
2007,GWBush,Republican,The result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"This is not the fight we entered in Iraq, but it is the fight we're in."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Every one of us wishes this war were over and won.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Let us find our resolve and turn events toward victory.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We're carrying out a new strategy in Iraq, a plan that demands more from Iraq's elected Government and gives our forces in Iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Our goal is a democratic Iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In order to make progress toward this goal, the Iraqi Government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital."
2007,GWBush,Republican,But the Iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"So we're deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and marines to Iraq."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And in Anbar Province, where Al Qaida terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We didn't drive Al Qaida out of their safe haven in Afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free Iraq.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"The people of Iraq want to live in peace, and now it's time for their Government to act."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Iraq's leaders know that our commitment is not open ended.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"They have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure Baghdad, and they must do so."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"They pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party, and they need to follow through and lift needless restrictions on Iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of Baghdad."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Iraq's leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks: to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of Iraq's citizens, to put the wealth of Iraq into the rebuilding of Iraq, to allow more Iraqis to reenter their nation's civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every Iraqi Province."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"But for all of this to happen, Baghdad must be secure, and our plan will help the Iraqi Government take back its capital and make good on its commitments."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"My fellow citizens, our military commanders and I have carefully weighed the options."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We discussed every possible approach.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In the end, I chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Many in this Chamber understand that America must not fail in Iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"If American forces step back before Baghdad is secure, the Iraqi Government would be overrun by extremists on all sides."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We could expect an epic battle between Shi'a extremists backed by Iran and Sunni extremists aided by Al Qaida and supporters of the old regime.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"A contagion of violence could spill out across the country, and, in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For America, this is a nightmare scenario; for the enemy, this is the objective."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Chaos is the greatest ally, their greatest ally in this struggle."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And out of chaos in Iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm America."
2007,GWBush,Republican,To allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of September the 11th and invite tragedy.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for America to succeed in the Middle East, to succeed in Iraq, and to spare the American people from this danger."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"This is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now."
2007,GWBush,Republican,I have spoken with many of you in person.
2007,GWBush,Republican,I respect you and the arguments you've made.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way.
2007,GWBush,Republican,The war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and I have turned our duties over to others.
2007,GWBush,Republican,And that's why it's important to work together so our Nation can see this great effort through.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Both parties and both branches should work in close consultation.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"It's why I've proposed to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in Congress from both political parties."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We will share ideas for how to position America to meet every challenge that confronts us.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We'll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory.
2007,GWBush,Republican,And one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the American Armed Forces are ready for all the challenges ahead.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I ask the Congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 in the next 5 years."
2007,GWBush,Republican,A second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Such a corps would function much like our military reserve.
2007,GWBush,Republican,It would ease the burden on the Armed Forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when America needs them.
2007,GWBush,Republican,It would give people across America who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we're not in this struggle alone.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In Iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the United Nations."
2007,GWBush,Republican,We're working with Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and the Gulf States to increase support for Iraq's Government.
2007,GWBush,Republican,The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Iran and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in Tehran to acquire nuclear weapons.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"With the other members of the Quartet—the U.N., the EU, and Russia—we're pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the Holy Land and pursuing the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace and security."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In Afghanistan, NATO has taken the lead in turning back the Taliban and Al Qaida offensive, the first time the Alliance has deployed forces outside the North Atlantic area."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Together with our partners in China and Japan, Russia and South Korea, we're pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a Korean Peninsula free of nuclear weapons."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like Cuba, Belarus, and Burma, and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of Darfur."
2007,GWBush,Republican,American foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease, and that is precisely what America is doing."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We must continue to fight HIV/ AIDS, especially on the continent of Africa."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Because you funded the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the number of people receiving lifesaving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in 3 short years."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"I ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, and I ask you to provide $1.2 billion over 5 years so we can combat malaria in 15 African countries."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"I ask that you fund the Millennium Challenge Account, so that American aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"When America serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country."
2007,GWBush,Republican,These deeds reflect the character of our people.
2007,GWBush,Republican,The greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness and courage and self-sacrifice of the American people.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"You see this spirit often if you know where to look, and tonight we need only look above to the gallery."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Dikembe Mutombo grew up in Africa amid great poverty and disease.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"He came to Georgetown University on a scholarship to study medicine, but Coach John Thompson took a look at Dikembe and had a different idea. [Laughter] Dikembe became a star in the NBA and a citizen of the United States, but he never forgot the land of his birth or the duty to share his blessings with others."
2007,GWBush,Republican,He built a brand new hospital in his old hometown.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"A friend has said of this good-hearted man: ""Mutombo believes that God has given him this opportunity to do great things."" And we are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"After her daughter was born, Julie Aigner-Clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child."
2007,GWBush,Republican,So she borrowed some equipment and began filming children's videos in her basement.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"The Baby Einstein Company was born, and in just 5 years, her business grew to more than $20 million in sales."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In November 2001, Julie sold Baby Einstein to Walt Disney Company, and with her help, Baby Einstein has grown into a $200 million business."
2007,GWBush,Republican,Julie represents the great enterprising spirit of America.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And she is using her success to help others, producing child safety videos with John Walsh of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Julie says of her new project: ""I believe it is the most important thing I have ever done."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"I believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe."" And so tonight we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur, Julie Aigner-Clark."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Three weeks ago, Wesley Autrey was waiting at a Harlem subway station with his two little girls when he saw a man fall into the path of a train."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"With seconds to act, Wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads."
2007,GWBush,Republican,He insists he's not a hero.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"He says: ""We got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We have got to show each other some love."" There is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like Wesley Autrey."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Tommy Rieman was a teenager pumping gas in Independence, Kentucky, when he enlisted in the United States Army."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In December 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in Iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"From his Humvee, Sergeant Rieman returned fire."
2007,GWBush,Republican,He used his body as a shield to protect his gunner.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"He was shot in the chest and arm and received shrapnel wounds to his legs, yet he refused medical attention and stayed in the fight."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"He helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy's position."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"For his exceptional courage, Sergeant Rieman was awarded the Silver Star."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"In such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of America."
2007,GWBush,Republican,And these qualities are not in short supply.
2007,GWBush,Republican,This is a decent and honorable country and resilient too.
2007,GWBush,Republican,We've been through a lot together.
2007,GWBush,Republican,"We've met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead."
2007,GWBush,Republican,"Yet we can go forward with confidence, because the State of our Union is strong; our cause in the world is right; and tonight that cause goes on."
2007,GWBush,Republican,God bless.
2007,GWBush,Republican,See you next year.
2007,GWBush,Republican,Thank you for your prayers.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 28, 2008 Thank you all."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it's fair to say, we've answered the call. [Laughter] Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government."
2008,GWBush,Republican,All of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people's business.
2008,GWBush,Republican,That is the purpose of this body.
2008,GWBush,Republican,It is the meaning of our oath.
2008,GWBush,Republican,It remains our charge to keep.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"From expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we've made good progress."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"To build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment."
2008,GWBush,Republican,The temptation will be to load up the bill.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working, and this Congress must pass it as soon as possible."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We have other work to do on taxes.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we've delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes.
2008,GWBush,Republican,I welcome their enthusiasm.
2008,GWBush,Republican,I'm pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders. [Laughter] Most Americans think their taxes are high enough.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks."
2008,GWBush,Republican,There's only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And Members of Congress should know, if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Just as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Next week, I'll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion."
2008,GWBush,Republican,The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012.
2008,GWBush,Republican,American families have to balance their budgets; so should their Government.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The people's trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half."
2008,GWBush,Republican,I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Unfortunately, neither goal was met."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I'll send it back to you with my veto."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And Congress can help even more.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"To build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not Government control."
2008,GWBush,Republican,So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor's office, not in the Halls of Congress."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Six years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Reading scores are on the rise.
2008,GWBush,Republican,African American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Members of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"It is succeeding, and we owe it to America's children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation's Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other nonpublic school."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America's inner cities."
2008,GWBush,Republican,So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We have seen how Pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Together, we've expanded the size and reach of these grants."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world."
2008,GWBush,Republican,So we're working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We're working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"At the same time, we're pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements."
2008,GWBush,Republican,I thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru.
2008,GWBush,Republican,And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets."
2008,GWBush,Republican,These agreements will level the playing field.
2008,GWBush,Republican,They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say ""Made in the U.S.A."" These agreements also promote America's strategic interests."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help."
2008,GWBush,Republican,I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"To build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Together, we should take the next steps."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases."
2008,GWBush,Republican,This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change.
2008,GWBush,Republican,And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"To keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding."
2008,GWBush,Republican,This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge.
2008,GWBush,Republican,So I ask Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells."
2008,GWBush,Republican,This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life.
2008,GWBush,Republican,So we're expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"I've submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Over the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Americans have volunteered in record numbers.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Charitable donations are higher than ever.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the Federal Government."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for Federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast.
2008,GWBush,Republican,America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight I'm pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year's North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans."
2008,GWBush,Republican,There are two other pressing challenges that I've raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits."
2008,GWBush,Republican,I've laid out proposals to reform these programs.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The other pressing challenge is immigration.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We're increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We've effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy.
2008,GWBush,Republican,This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals.
2008,GWBush,Republican,This is the business of our Nation here at home.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new parliament.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom.
2008,GWBush,Republican,These images of liberty have inspired us.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the past 7 years, we've also seen the images that have sobered us."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin's hand.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We've seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"These successes must continue, so we're adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaida is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America's vital mission in Afghanistan."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos."
2008,GWBush,Republican,So we reviewed our strategy and changed course.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We gave our troops a new mission: work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country."
2008,GWBush,Republican,The Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation."
2008,GWBush,Republican,The Iraqis launched a surge of their own.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaida's brutality, started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"While the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"When we met last year, militia extremists—some armed and trained by Iran— were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"When we met last year, Al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Today, it is Al Qaida that is searching for safe passage."
2008,GWBush,Republican,They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Last month, Usama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"When we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home."
2008,GWBush,Republican,This progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders.
2008,GWBush,Republican,This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we've asked of you and more."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our Nation is grateful for your courage.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We are proud of your accomplishments.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight in this hallowed Chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our Nation."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our enemies in Iraq have been hit hard.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Any further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, ""the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence."" Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they're making toward political reconciliation."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"At the local level, Sunnis, Shi'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Progress in the Provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We're seeing some encouraging signs.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The national Government is sharing oil revenues with the Provinces.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba'athification reform.
2008,GWBush,Republican,They're now debating a Provincial powers law.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation, but it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed."
2008,GWBush,Republican,A free Iraq will deny Al Qaida a safe haven.
2008,GWBush,Republican,A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"By contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland."
2008,GWBush,Republican,The enemy has made its intentions clear.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaida's top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"My fellow Americans, we will not rest either."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"We're also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year."
2008,GWBush,Republican,The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We're also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Iran's rulers oppress a good and talented people.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We respect your traditions and your history.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We look forward to the day when you have your freedom.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"On the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country."
2008,GWBush,Republican,This is our most solemn duty.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11.
2008,GWBush,Republican,This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"In the past 6 years, we've stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this Chamber owes them our thanks."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And we owe them something more; we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe.
2008,GWBush,Republican,And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they're planning."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Unfortunately, Congress set the legislations to expire on February the 1st."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"That means if you don't act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger."
2008,GWBush,Republican,Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've had ample time for debate.
2008,GWBush,Republican,The time to act is now.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Protecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military.
2008,GWBush,Republican,It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world."
2008,GWBush,Republican,This is a reflection of our national interests; it is the calling of our conscience.
2008,GWBush,Republican,America opposes genocide in Sudan.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma.
2008,GWBush,Republican,America is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We've also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative."
2008,GWBush,Republican,America is leading the fight against global hunger.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Today, more than half the world's food aid comes from the United States."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine."
2008,GWBush,Republican,America is leading the fight against disease.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"With your help, we're working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations."
2008,GWBush,Republican,And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We can bring healing and hope to many more.
2008,GWBush,Republican,So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success.
2008,GWBush,Republican,And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next 5 years.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"America is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us."
2008,GWBush,Republican,We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Over the past 7 years, we've increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And as we increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation."
2008,GWBush,Republican,I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity.
2008,GWBush,Republican,Our military families also sacrifice for America.
2008,GWBush,Republican,They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home.
2008,GWBush,Republican,We have a responsibility to provide for them.
2008,GWBush,Republican,"So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"Our military families serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our Nation honors them."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"The strength—the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our Government, but in the spirit and determination of our people."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our Nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, ""We the undersigned delegates."" When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the world: ""We the people."" By trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile, young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"And so long as we continue to trust the people, our Nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong."
2008,GWBush,Republican,"So tonight, with confidence in freedom's power and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business."
2008,GWBush,Republican,God bless America.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 27, 2010 Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our Union."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain."
2010,Obama,Democratic,These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our Union.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation, as one people."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Again, we are tested."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And again, we must answer history's call."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a Government deeply in debt."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"So we acted, immediately and aggressively."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And 1 year later, the worst of the storm has passed."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But the devastation remains.
2010,Obama,Democratic,One in 10 Americans still cannot find work.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Many businesses have shuttered.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Home values have declined.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And for those who'd already known poverty, life's become that much harder."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades: the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college."
2010,Obama,Democratic,So I know the anxieties that are out there right now.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're not new.
2010,Obama,Democratic,These struggles are the reason I ran for President.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"These struggles are what I've witnessed for years, in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I hear about them in the letters that I read each night.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Some are frustrated, some are angry."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems."
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They know we can't afford it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Not now.
2010,Obama,Democratic,So we face big and difficult challenges.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And what the American people hope, what they deserve, is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills, a chance to get ahead, most of all, the ability to give their children a better life."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And you know what else they share?
2010,Obama,Democratic,They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school."
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"One woman wrote to me and said, ""We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged."" It's because of this spirit, this great decency and great strength, that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Despite our hardships, our Union is strong."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We do not give up.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We do not quit.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"In this new decade, it's time the American people get a Government that matches their decency, that embodies their strength."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It begins with our economy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It was not easy to do.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I hated it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I hated it; you hated it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"It was about as popular as a root canal. [Laughter] But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular; I would do what was necessary."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today."
2010,Obama,Democratic,More businesses would certainly have closed.
2010,Obama,Democratic,More homes would have surely been lost.
2010,Obama,Democratic,So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks--most but not all."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We cut taxes for small businesses.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We cut taxes for first-time home buyers.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. [Applause] I thought I'd get some applause on that one. [Laughter] As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person--not a single dime.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first-responders."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And we're on track to add another 1 1/2 million jobs to this total by the end of the year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But you don't have to take their word for it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all."
2010,Obama,Democratic,There are stories like this all across America.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And after 2 years of recession, the economy is growing again."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. [Applause] I agree, absolutely."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession, and they're ready to grow."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even those that are making a profit."
2010,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our Nation has always been built to compete."
2010,Obama,Democratic,There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will."
2010,Obama,Democratic,They will.
2010,Obama,Democratic,People are out of work.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're hurting.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They need our help.
2010,Obama,Democratic,And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last 2 years."
2010,Obama,Democratic,The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from the last decade, what some call the ""lost decade,"" where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait?"
2010,Obama,Democratic,How long should America put its future on hold?
2010,Obama,Democratic,"You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Germany's not waiting.
2010,Obama,Democratic,India's not waiting.
2010,Obama,Democratic,These nations are--they're not standing still.
2010,Obama,Democratic,These nations aren't playing for second place.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're putting more emphasis on math and science.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're rebuilding their infrastructure.
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, one place to start is serious financial reform."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Look, I am not interested in punishing banks."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I'm interested in protecting our economy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs."
2010,Obama,Democratic,It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes, and the lobbyists are trying to kill it."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But we cannot let them win this fight.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We've got to get it right.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Next, we need to encourage American innovation."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells, but leaves healthy ones untouched."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country."
2010,Obama,Democratic,It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But here's the thing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And America must be that nation.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Third, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.
2010,Obama,Democratic,And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"In the 21st century, the best antipoverty program around is a world-class education."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And let's tell another 1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why last year, I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Yes, we do."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, let's clear a few things up."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. [Laughter] I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"After nearly a century of trying--Democratic administrations, Republican administrations--we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans."
2010,Obama,Democratic,The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. [Applause] Thank you, honey."
2010,Obama,Democratic,She gets embarrassed. [Laughter] Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, ""What's in it for me?"" But I also know this problem is not going away."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Millions will lose it this year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Our deficit will grow.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Premiums will go up.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Patients will be denied the care they need.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this Chamber."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"So as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let me know.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let me know.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I'm eager to see it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Not now.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Not when we are so close.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's get it done.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's get it done.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves."
2010,Obama,Democratic,It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.
2010,Obama,Democratic,So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"By the time I took office, we had a 1-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget."
2010,Obama,Democratic,All this was before I walked in the door. [Laughter] Now--[applause]--just stating the facts.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But we took office amid a crisis.
2010,Obama,Democratic,And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt.
2010,Obama,Democratic,That too is a fact.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions.
2010,Obama,Democratic,The Federal Government should do the same.
2010,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But all other discretionary Government programs will.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To help working families, we'll extend our middle class tax cuts."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We just can't afford it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad."
2010,Obama,Democratic,This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem.
2010,Obama,Democratic,The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission, so I'll issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's how budgeting works. [Laughter] But understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The problem is, that's what we did for 8 years."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's what helped us into this crisis.
2010,Obama,Democratic,It's what helped lead to these deficits.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We can't do it again.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's try common sense--[Laughter]--a novel concept.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, that's what I came to Washington to do."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts on--our White House visitors online."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But we can't stop there.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client, with my administration or with Congress."
2010,Obama,Democratic,It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities."
2010,Obama,Democratic,They should be decided by the American people.
2010,Obama,Democratic,And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicans--Democrats and Republicans."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Look, you've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"For example, some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Tonight I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I'm not naive."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and--[Laughter]--some postpartisan era.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years."
2010,Obama,Democratic,They're the very essence of our democracy.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is election day.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can.
2010,Obama,Democratic,The confirmation of--I'm speaking to both parties now--the confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our Government."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"So no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I know it's an election year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But we still need to govern.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town--a supermajority--then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions."
2010,Obama,Democratic,So let's show the American people that we can do it together.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"This week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"I know you can't wait. [Laughter] Now, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in relitigating the past."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I know that all of us love this country.
2010,Obama,Democratic,All of us are committed to its defense.
2010,Obama,Democratic,So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our Nation and forge a more hopeful future for America and for the world.
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's the work we began last year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Since the day I took office, we've renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and women alike."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"There will be difficult days ahead, but I am absolutely confident we will succeed."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"As we take the fight to Al Qaida, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as President."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We will support the Iraqi Government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight all of our men and women in uniform, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world, they have to know that we--that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's why we're building a 21st-century VA.
2010,Obama,Democratic,And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons."
2010,Obama,Democratic,I've embraced the vision of John F.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, DC, behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are being vigorously enforced."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They too will face growing consequences."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That is a promise.
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We're working through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We're helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease, a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But we also do it because it is right.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea."
2010,Obama,Democratic,For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity--always.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals."
2010,Obama,Democratic,The same is true at home.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: The notion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different than anyone else."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We must continually renew this promise.
2010,Obama,Democratic,My administration has a Division that is once again prosecuting violations and employment discrimination.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are."
2010,Obama,Democratic,It's the right thing to do.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system, to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our Nation."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"In the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America, values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe, values that drive our citizens still."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country."
2010,Obama,Democratic,They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by, business values or labor values, they're American values."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions--our corporations, our media, and, yes, our Government--still reflect these same values."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away."
2010,Obama,Democratic,No wonder there's so much cynicism out there.
2010,Obama,Democratic,No wonder there's so much disappointment.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I campaigned on the promise of change.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Change we can believe in, the slogan went."
2010,Obama,Democratic,And right now I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But remember this: I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy."
2010,Obama,Democratic,That's just how it is.
2010,Obama,Democratic,Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election, instead of doing what's best for the next generation."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"But I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain, to do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their children and their grandchildren."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Now, our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved."
2010,Obama,Democratic,But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And what keeps me going, what keeps me fighting, is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"It lives on in the struggling small-business owner who wrote to me of his company, ""None of us,"" he said, "". . . are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail."" It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, ""We are strong."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We are resilient.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"We are American."" It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"And it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of ""U.S.A.!"
2010,Obama,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2010,Obama,Democratic,"U.S.A.!"" when another life was saved."
2010,Obama,Democratic,"The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people."
2010,Obama,Democratic,We have finished a difficult year.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We have come through a difficult decade.
2010,Obama,Democratic,But a new year has come.
2010,Obama,Democratic,A new decade stretches before us.
2010,Obama,Democratic,We don't quit.
2010,Obama,Democratic,I don't quit.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"Let's seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our Union once more."
2010,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2010,Obama,Democratic,"God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 25, 2011 Mr."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And as we mark this occasion, we're also mindful of the empty chair in this Chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend Gabby Giffords."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last 2 years.
2011,Obama,Democratic,The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And that's a good thing.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's what a robust democracy demands.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's what helps set us apart as a nation.
2011,Obama,Democratic,But there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater, something more consequential than party or political preference."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We are part of the American family.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people, that we share common hopes and a common creed, that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That too is what sets us apart as a nation.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of cooperation."
2011,Obama,Democratic,What comes of this moment is up to us.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I believe we can, and I believe we must."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's what the people who sent us here expect of us.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"With their votes, they've determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties."
2011,Obama,Democratic,New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We will move forward together or not at all, for the challenges we face are bigger than party and bigger than politics."
2011,Obama,Democratic,At stake right now is not who wins the next election.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"After all, we just had an election."
2011,Obama,Democratic,At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else.
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It's whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We are poised for progress.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back, corporate profits are up, the economy is growing again."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We measure progress by the success of our people, by the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer, by the prospects of a small-business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise, by the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's the project the American people want us to work on--together.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, we did that in December."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans' paychecks are a little bigger today."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than 1 million private sector jobs created last year."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But we have to do more.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"These steps we've taken over the last 2 years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we'll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"You didn't always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"If you worked hard, chances are you'd have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Maybe you'd even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That world has changed.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And for many, the change has been painful."
2011,Obama,Democratic,I've seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I've heard it in the frustrations of Americans who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear, proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game."
2011,Obama,Democratic,They're right.
2011,Obama,Democratic,The rules have changed.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work, and do business."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there's an Internet connection."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science."
2011,Obama,Democratic,They're investing in research and new technologies.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Just recently, China became the home to the world's largest private solar research facility and the world's fastest computer."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"So yes, the world is changed."
2011,Obama,Democratic,The competition for jobs is real.
2011,Obama,Democratic,But this shouldn't discourage us.
2011,Obama,Democratic,It should challenge us.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Remember, for all the hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world."
2011,Obama,Democratic,No workers are more productive than ours.
2011,Obama,Democratic,No country has more successful companies or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We're the home to the world's best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"What's more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea: the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It's why our students don't just memorize equations, but answer questions like: ""What do you think of that idea?"
2011,Obama,Democratic,What would you change about the world?
2011,Obama,Democratic,"What do you want to be when you grow up?"" The future is ours to win."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But to get there, we can't just stand still."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"As Robert Kennedy told us: ""The future is not a gift."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It is an achievement."" Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It has required each generation to sacrifice and struggle and meet the demands of a new age.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And now it's our turn.
2011,Obama,Democratic,We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We need to outinnovate, outeducate, and outbuild the rest of the world."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.
2011,Obama,Democratic,We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our Government.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's how our people will prosper.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's how we'll win the future.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And tonight I'd like to talk about how we get there.
2011,Obama,Democratic,The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.
2011,Obama,Democratic,None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Thirty years ago, we couldn't know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution."
2011,Obama,Democratic,What we can do--what America does better than anyone else--is spark the creativity and imagination of our people.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We're the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers, of Google and Facebook."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In America, innovation doesn't just change our lives."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It is how we make our living.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But because it's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our Government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's what planted the seeds for the Internet.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Just think of all the good jobs--from manufacturing to retail--that have come from these breakthroughs.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the Moon."
2011,Obama,Democratic,The science wasn't even there yet.
2011,Obama,Democratic,NASA didn't exist.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets, we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs."
2011,Obama,Democratic,This is our generation's Sputnik moment.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen since the height of the space race."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We'll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology, an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Already, we're seeing the promise of renewable energy."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"After September 11, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Today, with the help of a Government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In Robert's words, ""We reinvented ourselves."" That's what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we've begun to reinvent our energy policy."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We're not just handing out money.
2011,Obama,Democratic,We're issuing a challenge.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We're telling America's scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we'll fund the Apollo projects of our time."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"At the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they're using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We need to get behind this innovation.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And to help pay for it, I'm asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I don't know if you've noticed, but they're doing just fine on their own. [Laughter] So instead of subsidizing yesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow's."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they're selling."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"So tonight I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Some folks want wind and solar.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Others want nuclear, clean coal, and natural gas."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To meet this goal, we will need them all, and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America's success.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But if we want to win the future, if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas, then we also have to win the race to educate our kids."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Think about it.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education."
2011,Obama,Democratic,And yet as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.
2011,Obama,Democratic,The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.
2011,Obama,Democratic,America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And so the question is whether all of us, as citizens and as parents, are willing to do what's necessary to give every child a chance to succeed."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's family that first instills the love of learning in a child.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We need to teach our kids that it's not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Our schools share this responsibility.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But too many schools don't meet this test.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"That's why instead of just pouring money into a system that's not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To all 50 States, we said, ""If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we'll show you the money."" Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 States to raise their standards for teaching and learning."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic Governors throughout the country."
2011,Obama,Democratic,And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that's more flexible and focused on what's best for our kids.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"You see, we know what's possible from our children when reform isn't just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado, located on turf between two rival gangs."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Most will be the first in their families to go to college.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And after the first year of the school's transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, ""Thank you, Ms."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it."" That's what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Let's also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In South Korea, teachers are known as nation builders."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Here in America, it's time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, to every young person listening tonight who's contemplating their career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of our Nation, if you want to make a difference in the life of a child, become a teacher."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Your country needs you.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's why we've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And this year, I ask Congress to go further and make permanent our tuition tax credit, worth $10,000 for 4 years of college."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's the right thing to do.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today's fast-changing economy, we're also revitalizing America's community colleges."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And she told me she's earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"As Kathy said, ""I hope it tells them to never give up."" If we take these steps, if we raise expectations for every child and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take, we will reach the goal that I set 2 years ago: By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"One last point about education: Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It makes no sense.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws, and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows."
2011,Obama,Democratic,I know that debate will be difficult.
2011,Obama,Democratic,I know it will take time.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But tonight, let's agree to make that effort."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And let's stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this Nation."
2011,Obama,Democratic,The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information, from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped."
2011,Obama,Democratic,South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.
2011,Obama,Democratic,China is building faster trains and newer airports.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our Nation's infrastructure, they gave us a D."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We have to do better.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System."
2011,Obama,Democratic,The jobs created by these projects didn't just come from laying down track or pavement.
2011,Obama,Democratic,They came from businesses that opened near a town's new train station or the new off-ramp.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"So over the last 2 years, we've begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry."
2011,Obama,Democratic,And tonight I'm proposing that we redouble those efforts.
2011,Obama,Democratic,We'll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We'll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on]* what's best for the economy, not politicians."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail."
2011,Obama,Democratic,This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"For some trips, it will be faster than flying, without the pat-down. [Laughter] As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Within the next 5 years, we'll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans."
2011,Obama,Democratic,This isn't just about--this isn't about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls.
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's about connecting every part of America to the digital age.
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small-business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It's about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device, a student who can take classes with a digital textbook, or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"All these investments--in innovation, education, and infrastructure--will make America a better place to do business and create jobs."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the Tax Code to benefit particular companies and industries."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all.
2011,Obama,Democratic,But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It makes no sense, and it has to change."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"So tonight I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system, get rid of the loopholes, level the playing field, and use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years without adding to our deficit."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It can be done.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Already, our exports are up."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans, and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"That's what we did with Korea, and that's what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia-Pacific and global trade talks."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of Government regulations."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American people.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's what we've done in this country for more than a century.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It's why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's why we have speed limits and child labor laws.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It's why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis."
2011,Obama,Democratic,And it's why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law. [Laughter] So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.
2011,Obama,Democratic,What I'm not willing to do--what I'm not willing to do--is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I'm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I'm not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small-businessman from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients'--parents' coverage."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"So I say to this Chamber tonight: Instead of refighting the battles of the last 2 years, let's fix what needs fixing, and let's move forward."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren't buried under a mountain of debt."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's pockets."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our Government spends more than it takes in."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That is not sustainable.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means."
2011,Obama,Democratic,They deserve a Government that does the same.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"So tonight I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next 5 years."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President."
2011,Obama,Democratic,This freeze will require painful cuts.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Already, we've frozen the salaries of hard-working Federal employees for the next 2 years."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I've proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs."
2011,Obama,Democratic,The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I recognize that some in this Chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But let's make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And let's make sure that what we're cutting is really excess weight.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It may make you feel like you're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you feel the impact. [Laughter] Now, most of the cuts and savings I've proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It won't.
2011,Obama,Democratic,The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I don't agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it, in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Still, I'm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year: medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities, without slashing benefits for future generations, and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"It's not a matter of punishing their success, it's about promoting America's success."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual Tax Code."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them."
2011,Obama,Democratic,So now is the time to act.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Now is the time for both sides and both Houses of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Let me take this one step further.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We shouldn't just give our people a Government that's more affordable, we should give them a Government that's more competent and more efficient."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We can't win the future with a Government of the past.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the Government happened in the age of black-and-white TV."
2011,Obama,Democratic,There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports.
2011,Obama,Democratic,There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Then there's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater. [Laughter] I hear it gets even more complicated once they're smoked. [Laughter] Now, we've made great strides over the last 2 years in using technology and getting rid of waste."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We're selling acres of Federal office space that hasn't been used in years, and we'll cut through redtape to get rid of more."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But we need to think bigger.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the Federal Government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote, and we will push to get it passed."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In the coming year, we'll also work to rebuild people's faith in the institution of Government."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you'll be able to go to a web site and get that information for the very first time in history."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done: put that information online."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this: If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it."
2011,Obama,Democratic,I will veto it.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"The 21st-century Government that's open and competent, a government that lives within its means, an economy that's driven by new skills and new ideas--our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges."
2011,Obama,Democratic,No single wall separates East and West.
2011,Obama,Democratic,No one rival superpower is aligned against us.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion."
2011,Obama,Democratic,And America's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And because we've begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America's standing has been restored."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new Government has been formed."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq."
2011,Obama,Democratic,America's commitment has been kept.
2011,Obama,Democratic,The Iraq war is coming to an end.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, as we speak, Al Qaida and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we're disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family."
2011,Obama,Democratic,We've also taken the fight to Al Qaida and their allies abroad.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Our purpose is clear: By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny Al Qaida the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan Government will need to deliver better governance."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead, and this July, we will begin to bring our troops home."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"In Pakistan, Al Qaida's leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Their safe havens are shrinking.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And we've sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you."
2011,Obama,Democratic,American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because Republicans and Democrats approved the new START Treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian Government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons."
2011,Obama,Democratic,This is just a part of how we're shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We've reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Around the globe, we're standing with those who take responsibility, helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power; it must also be the purpose behind it.
2011,Obama,Democratic,In south Sudan--with our assistance--the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Thousands lined up before dawn.
2011,Obama,Democratic,People danced in the streets.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him. ""This was a battlefield for most of my life,"" he said. ""Now we want to be free."" And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator."
2011,Obama,Democratic,And tonight let us be clear: The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.
2011,Obama,Democratic,We must never forget that the things we've struggled for and fought for live in the hearts of people everywhere.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Tonight let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our Nation is united in support of our troops and their families.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Let us serve them as well as they've served us, by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own Nation."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Our troops come from every corner of this country.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"They're Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And yes, we know that some of them are gay."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC."
2011,Obama,Democratic,It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.
2011,Obama,Democratic,It is time to move forward as one Nation.
2011,Obama,Democratic,We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit, none of this will be easy."
2011,Obama,Democratic,All of it will take time.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And it will be harder because we will argue about everything: the costs, the details, the letter of every law."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, some countries don't have this problem."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"If they don't want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn't get written."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn't a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible, no matter who you are, no matter where you come from."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me. [Laughter] That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth.
2011,Obama,Democratic,That dream--that American Dream--is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era.
2011,Obama,Democratic,It's what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And that dream is the story of a small-business owner named Brandon Fisher.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them."
2011,Obama,Democratic,But Brandon thought his company could help.
2011,Obama,Democratic,And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment, and Brandon left for Chile."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working 3 or 4 hour--3 or 4 days at a time without any sleep."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded and the miners were rescued."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"But because he didn't want all of the attention, Brandon wasn't there when the miners emerged."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"He'd already gone back home, back to work on his next project."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, ""We proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things."" We do big things."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream."
2011,Obama,Democratic,That's how we win the future.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"We're a nation that says, ""I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company."" ""I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree."" ""I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try."" ""I'm not sure how we'll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we'll get there."
2011,Obama,Democratic,"I know we will."" We do big things."
2011,Obama,Democratic,The idea of America endures.
2011,Obama,Democratic,Our destiny remains our choice.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"And tonight, more than two centuries later, it's because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our Union is strong."
2011,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2011,Obama,Democratic,"God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 24, 2012 Mr."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought and several thousand gave their lives."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"For the first time in 9 years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"For the first time in two decades, Usama bin Laden is not a threat to this country."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Most of Al Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and teamwork of America's Armed Forces."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations."
2012,Obama,Democratic,They're not consumed with personal ambition.
2012,Obama,Democratic,They don't obsess over their differences.
2012,Obama,Democratic,They focus on the mission at hand.
2012,Obama,Democratic,They work together.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Think about the America within our reach: a country that leads the world in educating its people; an America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs; a future where we're in control of our own energy and our security and prosperity aren't so tied to unstable parts of the world; an economy built to last, where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We can do this.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"I know we can, because we've done it before."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's army, got the chance to go to college on the GI bill."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"They understood they were part of something larger, that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share, the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive.
2012,Obama,Democratic,No challenge is more urgent.
2012,Obama,Democratic,No debate is more important.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"What's at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And we have to reclaim them.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Let's remember how we got here.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hard-working Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and personal debt that kept piling up."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In 2008, the house of cards collapsed."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Regulators had looked the other way or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It was wrong, it was irresponsible, and it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In the 6 months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Those are the facts.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But so are these: In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Together, we've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And we've put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable so a crisis like this never happens again.
2012,Obama,Democratic,The state of our Union is getting stronger.
2012,Obama,Democratic,And we've come too far to turn back now.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in this Chamber to build on this momentum."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight I want to speak about how we move forward and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to last, an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Some even said we should let it die.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We got workers and automakers to settle their differences.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We got the industry to retool and restructure.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Today, General Motors is back on top as the world's number-one automaker."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We bet on American workers.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We bet on American ingenuity.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And tonight, the American auto industry is back."
2012,Obama,Democratic,What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries.
2012,Obama,Democratic,It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We can't bring every job back that's left our shore.
2012,Obama,Democratic,But right now it's getting more expensive to do business in places like China.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Meanwhile, America is more productive."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock's unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back.
2012,Obama,Democratic,But we have to seize it.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We should start with our Tax Code.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Right now companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It makes no sense, and everyone knows it."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So let's change it.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"First, if you're a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So my message is simple: It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over 5 years."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we're on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And soon there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Soon there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit and Toledo and Chicago.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products.
2012,Obama,Democratic,And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration, and it's made a difference."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.
2012,Obama,Democratic,But we need to do more.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It's not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated."
2012,Obama,Democratic,It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Tonight I'm announcing the creation of a trade enforcement unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.
2012,Obama,Democratic,There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.
2012,Obama,Democratic,And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you, America will always win."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States, but can't find workers with the right skills."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Think about that: openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It's inexcusable, and we know how to fix it."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Then, Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant."
2012,Obama,Democratic,I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.
2012,Obama,Democratic,My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte and Orlando and Louisville are up and running.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers, places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need."
2012,Obama,Democratic,It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.
2012,Obama,Democratic,These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"For less than 1 percent of what our Nation spends on education each year, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning, the first time that's happened in a generation."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But challenges remain, and we know how to solve them."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000."
2012,Obama,Democratic,A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Every person in this Chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies, just to make a difference."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Teachers matter.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"So, instead of bashing them or defending the status quo, let's offer schools a deal."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job and reward the best ones.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And in return, grant schools flexibility to teach with creativity and passion, to stop teaching to the test, and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's a bargain worth making.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We also know that when students don't walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I am proposing that every State--every State--requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next 5 years."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money.
2012,Obama,Democratic,States also need to do their part by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.
2012,Obama,Democratic,And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who have done just that."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Some use better technology.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"The point is, it's possible."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Higher education can't be a luxury.
2012,Obama,Democratic,It is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hard-working students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren't yet American citizens."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That doesn't make sense.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration.
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before.
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.
2012,Obama,Democratic,The opponents of action are out of excuses.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I will sign it right away.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That means women should earn equal pay for equal work.
2012,Obama,Democratic,It means we should support everyone who's willing to work and every risk taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"After all, innovation is what America has always been about."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Most new jobs are created in startups and small businesses.
2012,Obama,Democratic,So let's pass an agenda that helps them succeed.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Both parties agree on these ideas.
2012,Obama,Democratic,So put them in a bill and get it on my desk this year.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Innovation also demands basic research.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched, new lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Don't gut these investments in our budget.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Don't let other countries win the race for the future.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet, to new American jobs and new American industries."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Over the last 3 years, we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight I'm directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Right now--right now--American oil production is the highest that it's been in 8 years.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That's right, 8 years."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Not only that, last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't enough."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy, a strategy that's cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.
2012,Obama,Democratic,And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And I'm requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock, reminding us that Government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now, what's true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In 3 years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Because of Federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55 no one would give him a second chance."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Today, it's hiring workers like Bryan, who said, ""I'm proud to be working in the industry of the future."" Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don't always come right away."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Some technologies don't pan out, some companies fail."
2012,Obama,Democratic,But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We've subsidized oil companies for a century.
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's long enough.
2012,Obama,Democratic,It's time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable and double down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Pass clean energy tax credits.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Create these jobs.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.
2012,Obama,Democratic,The differences in this Chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.
2012,Obama,Democratic,But there's no reason why Congress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"So far, you haven't acted."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Well, tonight I will."
2012,Obama,Democratic,I'm directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And I'm proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world's largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history, with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So here's a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Their energy bills will be a hundred billion dollars lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Send me a bill that creates these jobs.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America's infrastructure.
2012,Obama,Democratic,So much of America needs to be rebuilt.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We've got crumbling roads and bridges, a power grid that wastes too much energy, an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small-business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"After World War II, we connected our States with a system of highways."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive order clearing away the redtape that slows down too many construction projects."
2012,Obama,Democratic,But you need to fund these projects.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Take the money we're no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"There's never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones who were hurt."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home values decline.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage by refinancing at historically low rates."
2012,Obama,Democratic,No more redtape.
2012,Obama,Democratic,No more runaround from the banks.
2012,Obama,Democratic,A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do the same.
2012,Obama,Democratic,It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts."
2012,Obama,Democratic,An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them.
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices, these don't destroy the free market."
2012,Obama,Democratic,They make the free market work better.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"There's no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first 3 years of my Presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his."
2012,Obama,Democratic,I've ordered every Federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make sense.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We've already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next 5 years."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill, because milk was somehow classified as an oil."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. [Laughter] Now, I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a Federal agency looking over his shoulder."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Absolutely.
2012,Obama,Democratic,But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf 2 years ago.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.
2012,Obama,Democratic,The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system's core purpose: getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home or start a business or send their kids to college.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"So, if you are a big bank or financial institution, you're no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"You're required to write out a ""living will"" that details exactly how you'll pay the bills if you fail, because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices, those days are over."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray, with one job: to look out for them."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We'll also establish a financial crimes unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's investments.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Some financial firms violate major antifraud laws because there's no real penalty for being a repeat offender.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That's bad for consumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.
2012,Obama,Democratic,And tonight I'm asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of Federal prosecutors and leading State attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy."
2012,Obama,Democratic,But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Right now our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.
2012,Obama,Democratic,People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year.
2012,Obama,Democratic,There are plenty of ways to get this done.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"So let's agree right here, right now."
2012,Obama,Democratic,No side issues.
2012,Obama,Democratic,No drama.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Let's get it done.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But we need to do more, and that means making choices."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Right now we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the Tax Code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle class households."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Right now Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else, like education and medical research, a strong military and care for our veterans?"
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Because if we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The American people know what the right choice is.
2012,Obama,Democratic,So do I.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"As I told the Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But in return, we need to change our Tax Code so that people like me, and an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Tax reform should follow the Buffett rule.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"If you make more than a million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, if you're earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn't go up."
2012,Obama,Democratic,You're the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.
2012,Obama,Democratic,You're the ones who need relief.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now, you can call this class warfare all you want."
2012,Obama,Democratic,But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?
2012,Obama,Democratic,Most Americans would call that common sense.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We don't begrudge financial success in this country.
2012,Obama,Democratic,We admire it.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit or somebody else has to make up the difference, like a senior on a fixed income or a student trying to get through school or a family trying to make ends meet."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's not right.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Americans know that's not right.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"They know that this generation's success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's how we'll reduce our deficit.
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's an America built to last.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now: Nothing will get done in Washington this year or next year or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?
2012,Obama,Democratic,The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn't come from events beyond our control.
2012,Obama,Democratic,It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Who benefited from that fiasco?
2012,Obama,Democratic,I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad, and it seems to get worse every year."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Now, some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"So together, let's take some steps to fix that."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Send me a bill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress.
2012,Obama,Democratic,I will sign it tomorrow.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Let's make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can't lobby Congress and vice versa, an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days.
2012,Obama,Democratic,A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything--even routine business--passed through the Senate.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Neither party has been blameless in these tactics.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Now both parties should put an end to it.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up-or-down vote within 90 days."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The executive branch also needs to change.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Too often, it's inefficient, outdated, and remote."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That's why I've asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the Federal bureaucracy so that our Government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction, that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around commonsense ideas."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"I'm a Democrat, but I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed: that Government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves and no more."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's why my education reform offers more competition and more control for schools and States.
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That's why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a Government program."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about Government spending have supported federally financed roads and clean energy projects and Federal offices for the folks back home."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective Government."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow."
2012,Obama,Democratic,But I can do a whole lot more with your help.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Because when we act together, there's nothing the United States of America can't achieve."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the last few years.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"From Pakistan to Yemen, the Al Qaida operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United States of America."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Ten thousand of our troops have come home.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan so that it is never again a source of attacks against America."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo, from Sana'a to Tripoli."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest serving dictators, a murderer with American blood on his hands."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Today, he is gone."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Asad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed and that human dignity cannot be denied."
2012,Obama,Democratic,How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain.
2012,Obama,Democratic,But we have a huge stake in the outcome.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And while it's ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well."
2012,Obama,Democratic,We will stand against violence and intimidation.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings: men and women; Christians, Muslims, and Jews."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And we will safeguard America's own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Look at Iran.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The regime is more isolated than ever before.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations."
2012,Obama,Democratic,The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Our ties to the Americas are deeper.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Our ironclad commitment--and I mean ironclad--to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"From the coalitions we've built to secure nuclear materials to the missions we've led against hunger and disease, from the blows we've dealt to our enemies to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're talking about."
2012,Obama,Democratic,That's not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That's not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they've been in years."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Yes, the world is changing."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"No, we can't control every event."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs, and as long as I'm President, I intend to keep it that way."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That's why, working with our military leaders, I've proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber threats."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"As they come home, we must serve them as well as they've served us."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned, which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year I've been President."
2012,Obama,Democratic,And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our Nation.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we're providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for veterans and their families."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And tonight I'm proposing a veterans jobs corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her."
2012,Obama,Democratic,Which brings me back to where I began.
2012,Obama,Democratic,Those of us who've been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When you put on that uniform, it doesn't matter if you're Black or White, Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When you're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you or the mission fails."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"You know, one of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden."
2012,Obama,Democratic,On it are each of their names.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Some may be Democrats, some may be Republicans, but that doesn't matter."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates, a man who was George Bush's Defense Secretary, and Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for President."
2012,Obama,Democratic,All that mattered that day was the mission.
2012,Obama,Democratic,No one thought about politics.
2012,Obama,Democratic,No one thought about themselves.
2012,Obama,Democratic,One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for the mission.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job: the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control, the translator who kept others from entering the compound, the troops who separated the women and children from the fight, the SEALs who charged up the stairs."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Because you can't charge up those stairs into darkness and danger unless you know that there's somebody behind you, watching your back."
2012,Obama,Democratic,So it is with America.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes."
2012,Obama,Democratic,No one built this country on their own.
2012,Obama,Democratic,This Nation is great because we built it together.
2012,Obama,Democratic,This Nation is great because we worked as a team.
2012,Obama,Democratic,This Nation is great because we get each other's backs.
2012,Obama,Democratic,"And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great, no mission too hard."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong."
2012,Obama,Democratic,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on the State of the Union February 12, 2013 Please, everybody, have a seat."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Mr.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow Americans: Fifty-one years ago, John F."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Kennedy declared to this Chamber that ""the Constitution makes us not rivals for power, but partners for progress."" ""It is my task,"" he said, ""to report the state of the Union; to improve it is the task of us all."" Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over 6 million new jobs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We buy more American cars than we have in 5 years and less foreign oil than we have in 20.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"So together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our Union is stronger."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Our economy is adding jobs, but too many people still can't find full-time employment."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Corporate profits have skyrocketed to alltime highs, but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country: the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or who you love."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great Nation."
2013,Obama,Democratic,The American people don't expect government to solve every problem.
2013,Obama,Democratic,They don't expect those of us in this Chamber to agree on every issue.
2013,Obama,Democratic,But they do expect us to put the Nation's interests before party.
2013,Obama,Democratic,They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.
2013,Obama,Democratic,For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this Union remains the task of us all.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget, decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion, mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Now we need to finish the job.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And the question is, how?"
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness."
2013,Obama,Democratic,They'd devastate priorities like education and energy and medical research.
2013,Obama,Democratic,They would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts—known here in Washington as the sequester—are a really bad idea."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare, and Social Security benefits."
2013,Obama,Democratic,That idea is even worse.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms; otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Most Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents—understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue and with everybody doing their fair share."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And that's the approach I offer tonight.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And the reforms I'm proposing go even further.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We'll bring down costs by changing the way our Government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Our Government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep, but we must keep the promises we've already made."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?"
2013,Obama,Democratic,How is that fair?
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits, but not closing some loopholes?"
2013,Obama,Democratic,How does that promote growth?
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We can get this done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,The American people deserve a Tax Code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring; a Tax Code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't work the system and pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a Tax Code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's what tax reform can deliver.
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's what we can do together.
2013,Obama,Democratic,I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy.
2013,Obama,Democratic,The politics will be hard for both sides.
2013,Obama,Democratic,None of us will get a hundred percent of what we want.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hard-working Americans."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So let's set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.
2013,Obama,Democratic,The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We can't do it.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Let's agree right here, right now to keep the people's Government open and pay our bills on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But let's be clear: Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"A growing economy that creates good, middle class jobs, that must be the north star that guides our efforts."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores?"
2013,Obama,Democratic,How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs?
2013,Obama,Democratic,And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, a year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda.
2013,Obama,Democratic,I urge this Congress to pass the rest.
2013,Obama,Democratic,But tonight I'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let me repeat: Nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It is not a bigger Government we need, but a smarter Government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth."
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's what we should be looking for.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past 3."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again."
2013,Obama,Democratic,There are things we can do right now to accelerate this trend.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio."
2013,Obama,Democratic,A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the-art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.
2013,Obama,Democratic,There's no reason this can't happen in other towns.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"So tonight I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We can get that done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy—every dollar.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"They're developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs, devising new materials to make batteries 10 times more powerful."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation, now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the space race."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We need to make those investments.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar, with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We produce more natural gas than ever before, and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And over the last 4 years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, it's true that no single event makes a trend."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods—all are now more frequent and more intense."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy and the most severe drought in decades and the worst wildfires some States have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And 4 years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And we've begun to change that.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So let's generate even more.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Solar energy gets cheaper by the year; let's drive down costs even further.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We need to encourage that.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And that's why my administration will keep cutting redtape and speeding up new oil and gas permits.
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan.
2013,Obama,Democratic,But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let's take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up with for far too long.
2013,Obama,Democratic,I'm also issuing a new goal for America: Let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We'll work with the States to do it.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Those States with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive Federal support to help make that happen.
2013,Obama,Democratic,America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire, a country with deteriorating roads and bridges or one with high-speed rail and Internet, high-tech schools, self-healing power grids."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"The CEO of Siemens America—a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina—said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And that's the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I've seen all those ribbon-cuttings. [Laughter] So tonight I propose a Fix-It-First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a partnership to rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Let's prove there's no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let's start right away."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We can get this done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"The good news is, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 6 years.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's holding our entire economy back.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We need to fix it.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Right now there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for?"
2013,Obama,Democratic,Take a vote and send me that bill.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Why are—why would we be against that?
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance?"
2013,Obama,Democratic,Right now overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.
2013,Obama,Democratic,What's holding us back?
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let's streamline the process and help our economy grow.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing, all these things will help entrepreneurs and small-business owners expand and create new jobs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And that has to start at the earliest possible age.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But today, fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Most middle class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I propose working with States to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America.
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's something we should be able to do.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than 7 dollars later on: by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In States that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We know this works.
2013,Obama,Democratic,So let's do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let's give our kids that chance.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Right now countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school."
2013,Obama,Democratic,They've been trained for the jobs that are there.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now at schools like P-TECH in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We need to give every American student opportunities like this.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And 4 years ago, we started Race to the Top, a competition that convinced almost every State to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Tonight I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And we'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math: the skills today's employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It's a simple fact: The more education you've got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we've made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But taxpayers can't keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it's our job to make sure that they do."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of Federal aid.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And tomorrow my administration will release a new college scorecard that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criterion: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today's jobs require."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work—everybody who's willing to work hard—has the chance to get ahead.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And right now leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities, they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Now is the time to do it.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Now is the time to get it done. [Applause] Now is the time to get it done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Real reform means stronger border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made: putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship, a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In other words, we know what needs to be done."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both Chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So let's get this done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And America will be better for it.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let's get it done. [Applause] Let's get it done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,But we can't stop there.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Today the Senate passed the ""Violence Against Women's Act"" that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And I now urge the House to do the same.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Good job, Joe."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the ""Paycheck Fairness Act"" this year."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line."
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's wrong.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 States have chosen to bump theirs even higher."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the Federal minimum wage to $9 an hour."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We should be able to get that done.
2013,Obama,Democratic,This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank, rent or eviction, scraping by or finally getting ahead."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: Let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight let's also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead: factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up; inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job."
2013,Obama,Democratic,America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And that's why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Let's put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in rundown neighborhoods.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, we'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety and education and housing."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples and do more to encourage fatherhood, because what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child, it's having the courage to raise one."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And we want to encourage that.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We want to help that.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Stronger families.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Stronger communities.
2013,Obama,Democratic,A stronger America.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It is this kind of prosperity—broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class—that has always been the source of our progress at home."
2013,Obama,Democratic,It's also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Tonight we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of Al Qaida."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave service men and women."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"This drawdown will continue, and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan Government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of Al Qaida and their affiliates.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It's true, different Al Qaida affiliates and extremist groups have emerged, from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa."
2013,Obama,Democratic,The threat these groups pose is evolving.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen and Libya and Somalia provide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight."
2013,Obama,Democratic,That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we're doing things the right way."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, our challenges don't end with Al Qaida."
2013,Obama,Democratic,America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons.
2013,Obama,Democratic,The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"At the same time, we'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands, because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations."
2013,Obama,Democratic,America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, we know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mails."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why, earlier today, I signed a new Executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our Government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks."
2013,Obama,Democratic,This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And tonight I'm announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership with the European Union, because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all, not only because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, but also because it's the right thing to do."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy, by empowering women, by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed and power and educate themselves, by saving the world's children from preventable deaths, and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"You see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said: ""There is justice and law in the United States."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I want our country to be like that."" In defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa, from Europe to Asia."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights and support stable transitions to democracy."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt, but we can and will insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We'll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace.
2013,Obama,Democratic,These are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk: our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"As long as I'm Commander in Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and equal benefits for their families, gay and straight."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care—including mental health care—for our wounded warriors, supporting our military families, giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned."
2013,Obama,Democratic,And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Thank you, honey."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Thank you, Jill."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Defending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home.
2013,Obama,Democratic,That includes one of the most fundamental rights of a democracy: the right to vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, when any American, no matter where they live or what their party, are denied that right because they can't afford to wait for 5 or 6 or 7 hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals."
2013,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America.
2013,Obama,Democratic,And it definitely needs improvement.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"I'm asking two long-time experts in the field—who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign—to lead it."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We can fix this, and we will."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"The American people demand it, and so does our democracy."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come together to protect our most precious resource: our children."
2013,Obama,Democratic,It has been 2 months since Newtown.
2013,Obama,Democratic,I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence.
2013,Obama,Democratic,But this time is different.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Overwhelming majorities of Americans—Americans who believe in the Second Amendment—have come together around commonsense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Now, if you want to vote no, that's your choice."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But these proposals deserve a vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Because in the 2 months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun—more than a thousand."
2013,Obama,Democratic,One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.
2013,Obama,Democratic,She was 15 years old.
2013,Obama,Democratic,She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.
2013,Obama,Democratic,She was a majorette.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Just 3 weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my Inauguration."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this Chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence."
2013,Obama,Democratic,They deserve a vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,They deserve a vote. [Applause] They deserve a vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,The families of Newtown deserve a vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,The families of Aurora deserve a vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence, they deserve a simple vote."
2013,Obama,Democratic,They deserve a simple vote.
2013,Obama,Democratic,Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight."
2013,Obama,Democratic,But we were never sent here to be perfect.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this Nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We should follow their example.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn't thinking about how her own home was faring."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.
2013,Obama,Democratic,We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be 6 hours."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her, because Desiline is 102 years old."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, ""I voted."" [Applause] There's Desiline."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.
2013,Obama,Democratic,When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive—and he did not consider his own safety.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds."
2013,Obama,Democratic,"And when asked how he did that, Brian said, ""That's just the way we're made."" That's just the way we're made."
2013,Obama,Democratic,We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms and hold different views than the person beside us.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"But as Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens."
2013,Obama,Democratic,It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status.
2013,Obama,Democratic,It describes the way we're made.
2013,Obama,Democratic,It describes what we believe.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story."
2013,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2013,Obama,Democratic,"God bless you, and God bless these United States of America."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 28, 2014 The President."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Mr.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it and did her part to lift America's graduation rate to its highest levels in more than three decades."
2014,Obama,Democratic,An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than 8 million new jobs our businesses have created over the past 4 years.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil."
2014,Obama,Democratic,A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest 5-year stretch of farm exports in our history.
2014,Obama,Democratic,A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired, but dreaming big dreams for his son."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And in tight-knit communities all across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that after 12 long years is finally coming to an end."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight this Chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: It is you, our citizens, who make the state of our Union strong."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And here are the results of your efforts: the lowest unemployment rate in over 5 years; a rebounding housing market; a manufacturing sector that's adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s; more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world, the first time that's happened in nearly 20 years; our deficits cut by more than half."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world's number-one place to invest, America is."
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"After 5 years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The question for everyone in this Chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the Federal Government."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It's an important debate, one that dates back to our very founding."
2014,Obama,Democratic,But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy—when our differences shut down Government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States—then we are not doing right by the American people.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, as President, I'm committed to making Washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And I believe most of you are too.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year's severe cuts to priorities like education."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country's future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way, but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And in the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress together."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's make this a year of action.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That's what most Americans want: for all of us in this Chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And what I believe unites the people of this Nation—regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor—is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all: the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead in America."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, let's face it, that belief has suffered some serious blows."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Over more than three decades, even before the great recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Today, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better."
2014,Obama,Democratic,But average wages have barely budged.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Inequality has deepened.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Upward mobility has stalled.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone to get ahead."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And too many still aren't working at all.
2014,Obama,Democratic,So our job is to reverse these trends.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It won't happen right away, and we won't agree on everything."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Some require congressional action, and I am eager to work with all of you."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But America does not stand still, and neither will I."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"As usual, our First Lady sets a good example. [Applause] Well—[applause]."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Michelle's ""Let's Move!"" partnership with schools, businesses, local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in 30 years."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And that's an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit, where already, 150 universities, businesses, nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education and to help every hard-working kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And across the country, we're partnering with mayors, Governors, and State legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The point is, there are millions of Americans outside of Washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"They believe—and I believe—that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams."
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's what drew our forebears here.
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America's largest automaker; how the son of a barkeep is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Opportunity is who we are.
2014,Obama,Democratic,And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise.
2014,Obama,Democratic,We know where to start: The best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And over half of big manufacturers say they're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.
2014,Obama,Democratic,So let's make that decision easier for more companies.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our Tax Code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's flip that equation.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Let's work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Moreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes, because in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure."
2014,Obama,Democratic,We'll need Congress to protect more than 3 million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.
2014,Obama,Democratic,That can happen.
2014,Obama,Democratic,But I'll act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Youngstown, Ohio, where we've connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight I'm announcing, we'll launch six more this year."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Bipartisan bills in both Houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.
2014,Obama,Democratic,So get those bills to my desk.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Put more Americans back to work.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small-business owners who create most new jobs in America.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Over the past 5 years, my administration has made more loans to small-business owners than any other."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And when 98 percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and Asia—the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped ""Made in the U.S.A."" Listen, China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines, and neither should we."
2014,Obama,Democratic,We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.
2014,Obama,Democratic,This is an edge America cannot surrender.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.
2014,Obama,Democratic,And that's why Congress should undo the damage done by last year's cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery.
2014,Obama,Democratic,There are entire industries to be built based on vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or paper-thin material that's stronger than steel.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And let's pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly and needless litigation."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we have been in decades."
2014,Obama,Democratic,One of the reasons why is natural gas.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"If extracted safely, it's the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"I'll cut redtape to help States get those factories built and put folks to work, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Meanwhile, my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, our communities."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And while we're at it, I'll use my authority to protect more of our pristine Federal lands for future generations."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Well, it's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming, we're becoming a global leader in solar too."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Every 4 minutes, another American home or business goes solar, every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job cannot be outsourced."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don't need it so we can invest more in fuels of the future that do.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In the coming months, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Over the past 8 years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But we have to act with more urgency, because a changing climate is already harming Western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That's why I directed my administration to work with States, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will require some tough choices along the way."
2014,Obama,Democratic,But the debate is settled.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Climate change is a fact.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And when our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say, yes, we did."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Finally, if we're serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement and fix our broken immigration system."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted, and I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill their dreams—to study, invent, contribute to our culture—they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everybody."
2014,Obama,Democratic,So let's get immigration reform done this year. [Applause] Let's get it done.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It's time.
2014,Obama,Democratic,The ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But in this rapidly changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The good news is, we know how to do it."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"She knew that Ford needed parts for the best selling truck in America, and she knew how to make those parts."
2014,Obama,Democratic,She just needed the workforce.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center, places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or a better job."
2014,Obama,Democratic,She was flooded with new workers.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And what Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer and every job seeker.
2014,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I've asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America's training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.
2014,Obama,Democratic,That means more on-the-job training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs."
2014,Obama,Democratic,I'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in today's economy.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let me tell you why.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"She'd been steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through college."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"She'd never collected unemployment benefits, but she'd been paying taxes."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. ""We are the face of the unemployment crisis,"" she wrote. ""I'm not dependent on the government."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society, care about our neighbors."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"I'm confident that in time, I will find a job, I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Please give us this chance."" Congress, give these hard-working, responsible Americans that chance."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Give them that chance. [Applause] Give them the chance.
2014,Obama,Democratic,They need our help right now.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But more important, this country needs them in the game."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at new jobs, a new chance to support their families."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And in fact, this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same, because we are stronger when America fields a full team."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, it's not enough to train today's workforce."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We also have to prepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age 9.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And this son of a factory worker just found out, he's going to college this fall."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Race to the Top, with the help of Governors from both parties, has helped States raise expectations and performance."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, DC, are making big strides in preparing students with the skills for the new economy: problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, math."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, some of this change is hard."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But it is worth it, and it is working."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The problem is, we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not reaching them in time."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And that has to change.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's life is high-quality early education.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, I asked this Congress to help States make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-year-old."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And as a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But in the meantime, 30 States have raised pre-K funding on their own."
2014,Obama,Democratic,They know we can't wait.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"So just as we worked with States to reform our schools, this year, we'll invest in new partnerships with States and communities across the country in a Race to the Top for our youngest children."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And as Congress decides what it's going to do, I'm going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K that they need."
2014,Obama,Democratic,It is right for America.
2014,Obama,Democratic,We need to get this done.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next 4 years."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and 20 million students over the next 2 years, without adding a dime to the deficit."
2014,Obama,Democratic,We're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.
2014,Obama,Democratic,We're shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentive to offer better value so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college education.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We're offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to 10 percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And I'm reaching out to some of America's leading foundations and corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing especially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But we know our opportunity agenda won't be complete, and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise, unless we also do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off for every single American."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Women deserve equal pay for equal work.
2014,Obama,Democratic,She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.
2014,Obama,Democratic,A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or a sick parent without running into hardship.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And you know what, a father does too."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It is time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a ""Mad Men"" episode. [Laughter] This year, let's all come together—Congress, the White House, businesses from Wall Street to Main Street—to give every woman the opportunity she deserves."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Because I believe when women succeed, America succeeds."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, women hold a majority of lower wage jobs, but they're not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Americans understand that some people will earn more money than others, and we don't resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success."
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's what America is all about.
2014,Obama,Democratic,But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five States have passed laws to raise theirs."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Many businesses have done it on their own.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Nick Chute is here today with his boss, John Soranno."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"John's an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough. [Laughter] Only now he makes more of it. [Laughter] John just gave his employees a raise to 10 bucks an hour, and that's a decision that has eased their financial stress and boosted their morale."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Tonight I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's lead: Do what you can to raise your employees' wages.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It's good for the economy.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It's good for America.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"To every mayor, Governor, State legislator in America, I say: You don't have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover.
2014,Obama,Democratic,We should too.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least 10 dollars and 10 cents an hour."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Because if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you should not have to live in poverty."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Today, the Federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 dollars and 10 cents.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It's easy to remember: 10-10.
2014,Obama,Democratic,This will help families.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.
2014,Obama,Democratic,It does not involve any new bureaucratic program.
2014,Obama,Democratic,So join the rest of the country.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Say yes.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Give America a raise.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Give them a raise.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earned-income tax credit."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Right now it helps about half of all parents at some point.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Think about that: It helps about half of all parents in America at some point in their lives.
2014,Obama,Democratic,But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for single workers who don't have kids.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"So let's work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, help more Americans get ahead."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's do more to help Americans save for retirement.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Today, most workers don't have a pension."
2014,Obama,Democratic,A Social Security check often isn't enough on its own.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And while the stock market has doubled over the last 5 years, that doesn't help folks who don't have 401(k)s."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That's why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyI—MyRA."
2014,Obama,Democratic,It's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.
2014,Obama,Democratic,MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down Tax Code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little or nothing for middle class Americans."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job so they can save at work just like everybody in this Chamber can.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"One last point on financial security: For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of fixing that."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, a preexisting condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician's assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn't get health insurance."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But on January 1, she got covered."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"On January 3, she felt a sharp pain."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"On January 6, she had emergency surgery."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Just one week earlier, Amanda said, and that surgery would have meant bankruptcy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That's what health insurance reform is all about: the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parent's plan."
2014,Obama,Democratic,More than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Nine million.
2014,Obama,Democratic,And here's another number: zero.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Because of this law, no American—none, zero—can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma or back pain or cancer."
2014,Obama,Democratic,No woman can ever be charged more just because she's a woman.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And we did all this while adding years to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law. [Laughter] But I know that the American people are not interested in refighting old battles."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, increase choice, tell America what you'd do differently."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's see if the numbers add up.
2014,Obama,Democratic,But let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The first 40 were plenty. [Laughter] We all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what we're against."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, Kentucky is not the most liberal part of the country."
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's not where I got my highest vote totals. [Laughter] But he's like a man possessed when it comes to covering his Commonwealth's families.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"They're our neighbors and our friends, he said: ""They're people we shop and go to church with, farmers out on the tractor, grocery clerks."
2014,Obama,Democratic,They're people who go to work every morning praying they don't get sick.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"No one deserves to live that way."" Steve's right."
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's why tonight I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31. [Applause] Help them get covered.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Moms, get on your kids to sign up."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It will give her some peace of mind, and plus, she'll appreciate hearing from you. [Laughter] After all, that's the spirit that has always moved this Nation forward."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It's the spirit of citizenship, the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And the bipartisan Commission I appointed, chaired by my campaign lawyer and Governor Romney's campaign lawyer, came together and have offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let's support these efforts.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank accounts, that drives our democracy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"I've seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, police officers all over this country who say, ""We are not afraid."" And I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, in our shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Citizenship demands a sense of common purpose, participation in the hard work of self-government, an obligation to serve our communities."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And I know this Chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Today, all our troops are out of Iraq."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will finally be over."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"If the Afghan Government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of Al Qaida."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The fact is, that danger remains."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"While we've put Al Qaida's core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved as Al Qaida affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable those networks."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In Syria, we'll support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Here at home, we'll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyber attacks."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And as we reform our defense budget, we will have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions."
2014,Obama,Democratic,We have to remain vigilant.
2014,Obama,Democratic,But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our outstanding military alone.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"As Commander in Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But I will not send our troops into harm's way unless it is truly necessary, nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us: large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"So even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners, America must move off a permanent war footing."
2014,Obama,Democratic,That's why I've imposed prudent limits on the use of drones.
2014,Obama,Democratic,For we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"That's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs, because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people is not being violated."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military actions, but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"You see, in a world of complex threats, our security, our leadership, depends on all elements of our power, including strong and principled diplomacy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical weapons are being eliminated."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve, a future free of dictatorship, terror, and fear."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there, to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel, a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran's nuclear program and rolled back parts of that program for the very first time in a decade."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium."
2014,Obama,Democratic,It's not installing advanced centrifuges.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that Iran is not building a bomb.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And with our allies and partners, we're engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon."
2014,Obama,Democratic,These negotiations will be difficult.
2014,Obama,Democratic,They may not succeed.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"We are clear eyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like Hizballah, which threatens our allies."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And we're clear about the mistrust between our nations, mistrust that cannot be wished away."
2014,Obama,Democratic,But these negotiations don't rely on trust.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.
2014,Obama,Democratic,If John F.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today."
2014,Obama,Democratic,The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But let me be clear: If this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"If Iran's leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But if Iran's leaders do seize the chance—and we'll know soon enough—then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Now, finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe: to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want."
2014,Obama,Democratic,And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"From Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to have a say in their country's future."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Across Africa, we're bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"In the Americas, we're building new ties of commerce, but we're also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster, as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and who were greeted with words like, ""We will never forget your kindness"" and ""God bless America."" We do these things because they help promote our long-term security, and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment, when Team U.S.A. marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium and brings home the gold. [Laughter] Audience members."
2014,Obama,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2014,Obama,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2014,Obama,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2014,Obama,Democratic,The President.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might, but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them."
2014,Obama,Democratic,No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life."
2014,Obama,Democratic,We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they've earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care—including the mental health care—that they need.
2014,Obama,Democratic,We'll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.
2014,Obama,Democratic,And we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.
2014,Obama,Democratic,Let me tell you about one of those families I've come to know.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-day."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program and the ceremony."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"He was a strong, impressive young man, had an easy manner, he was sharp as a tack."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And we joked around and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"A few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"For months, he lay in a coma."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And the next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn't speak, could barely move."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, hours of grueling rehab every day."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye, still struggles on his left side."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And day by day, he's learned to speak again and stand again and walk again."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And he's working toward the day when he can serve his country again. ""My recovery has not been easy,"" he says. ""Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy."" Cory is here tonight."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Cory.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"Sometimes, we stumble, we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement, to free other nations from tyranny and fear, to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by our Founders are made real for every citizen."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"The America we want for our kids—a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong, where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us—none of it is easy."
2014,Obama,Democratic,"But if we work together—if we summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him—with our feet planted firmly in today, but our eyes cast toward tomorrow, I know it is within our reach."
2014,Obama,Democratic,Believe it.
2014,Obama,Democratic,"God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 20, 2015 The President."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Mr.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores, that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars, that saw a vicious recession spread across our Nation and the world."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It has been and still is a hard time for many.
2015,Obama,Democratic,But tonight we turn the page.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.
2015,Obama,Democratic,More of our kids are graduating than ever before.
2015,Obama,Democratic,More of our people are insured than ever before.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Today, fewer than 15,000 remain."
2015,Obama,Democratic,And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation who has served to keep us safe.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We are humbled and grateful for your service.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"America, for all that we have endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"At this moment—with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production—we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?
2015,Obama,Democratic,Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?"
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?"
2015,Obama,Democratic,Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another?
2015,Obama,Democratic,Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In 2 weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas."
2015,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.
2015,Obama,Democratic,It begins with our economy.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. [Laughter] She waited tables."
2015,Obama,Democratic,He worked construction.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Their first child Jack was on the way.
2015,Obama,Democratic,They were young and in love in America.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And it doesn't get much better than that. ""If only we had known,"" Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ""what was about to happen to the housing and construction market."" As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career.
2015,Obama,Democratic,They sacrificed for each other.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And slowly, it paid off."
2015,Obama,Democratic,They bought their first home.
2015,Obama,Democratic,They had a second son Henry.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Rebekah got a better job and then a raise.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Ben is back in construction and home for dinner every night. ""It is amazing,"" Rebekah wrote, ""what you can bounce back from when you have to. . . ."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times."" We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story."
2015,Obama,Democratic,They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.
2015,Obama,Democratic,You are the reason that I ran for this office.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"You are the people I was thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And over the past 5 years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And today, America is number one in oil and gas."
2015,Obama,Democratic,America is number one in wind power.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Every 3 weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Our high school graduation rate has hit an alltime high.
2015,Obama,Democratic,More Americans finish college than ever before.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"This is good news, people. [Laughter] So the verdict is clear."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Middle class economics works.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Expanding opportunity works.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got to fix a broken system.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It will have earned my veto.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Wages are finally starting to rise again.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But here's the thing: Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't screw things up—[laughter]—that Government doesn't halt the progress we're making."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We need to do more than just do no harm.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Because families like Rebekah's still need our help.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but they've had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Friday night pizza, that's a big splurge."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Like millions of hard-working Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"That's what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We don't just want everyone to share in America's success, we want everyone to contribute to our success."
2015,Obama,Democratic,So what does middle class economics require in our time?
2015,Obama,Democratic,"First, middle class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Here's one example.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"It's not a nice-to-have, it's a must-have."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"So it's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Here's another example.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave—43 million.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Think about that.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.
2015,Obama,Democratic,So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave.
2015,Obama,Democratic,It's the right thing to do. [Applause] It's the right thing to do.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I mean, it's 2015. [Laughter] It's time."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"If not, vote to give millions of the hardest working people in America a raise."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's not the job of government.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage—these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's a fact.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And that's what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Now, second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We were ahead of the curve.
2015,Obama,Democratic,But other countries caught on.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And in a 21st-century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We need to do more.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education—two in three."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And yet we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"It's not fair to them, and it's sure not smart for our future."
2015,Obama,Democratic,And that's why I'm sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Some are young and starting out.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Some are older and looking for a better job.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Understand, you've got to earn it."
2015,Obama,Democratic,You've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible."
2015,Obama,Democratic,I want to spread that idea all across America so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Let's stay ahead of the curve.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Tonight I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher paying jobs even if they don't have a higher education."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Already, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden—[applause]—thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill—has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"So to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago, jobs at companies like Google and eBay and Tesla."
2015,Obama,Democratic,So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.
2015,Obama,Democratic,But we do know we want them here in America.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We know that.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why the third part of middle class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Twenty-first century businesses need 21st-century infrastructure: modern ports and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.
2015,Obama,Democratic,So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Let's pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Let's do it.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Let's get it done. [Applause] Let's get it done.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest growing region."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Why would we let that happen?
2015,Obama,Democratic,We should write those rules.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We should level the playing field.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't just free, but are also fair."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It's the right thing to do.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense."
2015,Obama,Democratic,But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities.
2015,Obama,Democratic,More than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking to bring jobs back from China.
2015,Obama,Democratic,So let's give them one more reason to get it done.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine, one that delivers the right treatment at the right time."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable."
2015,Obama,Democratic,So tonight I'm launching a new precision medicine initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We can do this.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I intend to protect a free and open Internet, extend its reach to every classroom and every community and help folks build the fastest networks so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again; pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And in 2 months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"So good luck, Captain."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Make sure to Instagram it.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We're proud of you.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this Chamber."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Members of both parties have told me so.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does too."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the Tax Code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"They've riddled it with giveaways that the super-rich don't need, while denying a break to middle class families who do."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"This year, we have an opportunity to change that."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad and reward those that invest here in America.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Let's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Let's simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford."
2015,Obama,Democratic,And let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We need a Tax Code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together. [Applause] We can achieve it together."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Helping hard-working families make ends meet, giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy, maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness—this is where America needs to go."
2015,Obama,Democratic,I believe it's where the American people want to go.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores."
2015,Obama,Democratic,My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of America.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads, when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's what our enemies want us to do.
2015,Obama,Democratic,I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy, when we leverage our power with coalition building, when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's exactly what we're doing right now.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And around the globe, it is making a difference."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"First, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"At the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In Iraq and Syria, American leadership—including our military power—is stopping ISIL's advance."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Now, this effort will take time."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It will require focus.
2015,Obama,Democratic,But we will succeed.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And tonight I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We need that authority.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Second, we're demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small, by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy and reassuring our NATO allies."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states, Mr."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"That's what I heard from some folks. [Laughter] Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"That's how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new. [Laughter] And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba.
2015,Obama,Democratic,It stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"As His Holiness Pope Francis has said, diplomacy is the work of ""small steps."" And these small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Welcome home, Alan."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We're glad you're here.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails: alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions, and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It doesn't make sense.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And that's why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"So we're making sure our Government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And tonight I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That should be a bipartisan effort.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"If we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, our health care workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In the Asia-Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules: in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief."
2015,Obama,Democratic,And no challenge—no challenge—poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Two thousand fourteen was the planet's warmest year on record.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Now, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists, that we don't have enough information to act."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Well, I'm not a scientist, either."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"But you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists—[laughter]—at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe."
2015,Obama,Democratic,The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.
2015,Obama,Democratic,We should act like it.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And that's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.
2015,Obama,Democratic,I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"In Beijing, we made a historic announcement: The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And there's one last pillar of our leadership, and that's the example of our values."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained."
2015,Obama,Democratic,It's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"It's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"That's why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because ultimately, they will make us safer."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice."
2015,Obama,Democratic,So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Since I've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Now it is time to finish the job.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.
2015,Obama,Democratic,It is not who we are.
2015,Obama,Democratic,It's time to close Gitmo.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Looking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely, building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities, leading always with the example of our values—that's what makes us exceptional."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's what keeps us strong.
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, a Black America or a White America, but a United States of America."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a State of small towns, rich farmland, one of the world's great cities, a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my Presidency hasn't delivered on this vision."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"It's held up as proof not just of my own flaws—of which there are many—but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it."
2015,Obama,Democratic,I know how tempting such cynicism may be.
2015,Obama,Democratic,But I still think the cynics are wrong.
2015,Obama,Democratic,I still believe that we are one people.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I believe this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have seen America at its best."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, New London."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I've mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West, Texas, and West Virginia."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States that 7 in 10 Americans call home."
2015,Obama,Democratic,So I know the good and optimistic and big-hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America's hopes."
2015,Obama,Democratic,I've served in Congress with many of you.
2015,Obama,Democratic,I know many of you well.
2015,Obama,Democratic,There are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for: arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Imagine if we did something different.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Understand, a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine."
2015,Obama,Democratic,A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts rather than ""gotcha"" moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"A politics—a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"If we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments, but let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing alltime lows and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student and agree that no one benefits when a hard-working mom is snatched from her child and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants."
2015,Obama,Democratic,I've talked to Republicans and Democrats about that.
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's something that we can share.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred, that it's being denied to too many, and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.
2015,Obama,Democratic,But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And surely we can agree that it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us."
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's a better politics.
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's how we start rebuilding trust.
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's how we move this country forward.
2015,Obama,Democratic,That's what the American people want.
2015,Obama,Democratic,And that's what they deserve.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I have no more campaigns to run. [At this point, some audience members applauded.] My only agenda—[laughter]."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Audience member. [Inaudible] The President.
2015,Obama,Democratic,I know because I won both of them. [Laughter] My only agenda for the next 2 years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Because I want this Chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth: that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances, as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we're a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen: man and woman, young and old, Black and White, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Everybody matters.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red States and blue States, that we are the United States of America."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past 6 years: ""It's amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. . . ."
2015,Obama,Democratic,"We are a strong, tight-knit family who's made it through some very, very hard times."" My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We too have made it through some hard times.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America."
2015,Obama,Democratic,We have laid a new foundation.
2015,Obama,Democratic,A brighter future is ours to write.
2015,Obama,Democratic,"Let's begin this new chapter together, and let's start the work right now."
2015,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2015,Obama,Democratic,God bless you.
2015,Obama,Democratic,God bless this country we love.
2015,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union January 12, 2016 Thank you."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Mr.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, Mr."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that I've come here to report on the State of the Union."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And for this final one, I'm going to try to make it a little shorter."
2016,Obama,Democratic,I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. [Laughter] I've been there.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. [Laughter] Now, I understand that because it's an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But, Mr."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families."
2016,Obama,Democratic,So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But tonight I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Don't worry, I've got plenty—[laughter]—from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system, protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage."
2016,Obama,Democratic,All these things still matter to hard-working families.
2016,Obama,Democratic,They're still the right thing to do.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And I won't let up until they get done.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But for my final address to this Chamber, I don't want to just talk about next year."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I want to focus on the next 5 years, the next 10 years, and beyond."
2016,Obama,Democratic,I want to focus on our future.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We live in a time of extraordinary change, change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It promises this education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away."
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"America has been through big changes before: wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And each time, we overcame those fears."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the ""dogmas of the quiet past."" Instead, we thought anew and acted anew."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And because we did, because we saw opportunity with a—where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before."
2016,Obama,Democratic,What was true then can be true now.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Our unique strengths as a nation—our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law—these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, it's in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7 years."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's how we secured the freedom in every State to marry the person we love.
2016,Obama,Democratic,But such progress is not inevitable.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's the result of choices we make together.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And we face such choices right now.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"So let's talk about the future and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is or who controls the next Congress."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us and not what's worst?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Let me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We're in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest 2 years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Our auto industry just had its best year ever.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's just part of a manufacturing surge that's created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past 6 years."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And we've done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, what is true—and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious—is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the great recession hit, changes that have not let up."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Companies have less loyalty to their communities.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's made it harder for a hard-working family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"For the past 7 years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We've made progress, but we need to make more."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And despite all the political arguments that we've had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing pre-K for all and offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And we have to make college affordable for every American.
2016,Obama,Democratic,No hard-working student should be stuck in the red.
2016,Obama,Democratic,We've already reduced student loan payments by—to 10 percent of a borrower's income.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that's good.
2016,Obama,Democratic,But now we've actually got to cut the cost of college.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Providing 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year."
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's the right thing to do.
2016,Obama,Democratic,But a great education isn't all we need in this new economy.
2016,Obama,Democratic,We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber. [Laughter] For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build in the process.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business, you'll still have coverage."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And in the process, health care inflation has slowed."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon, but—[laughter]—a little applause back there. [Laughter] Just a guess."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Say a hard-working American loses his job.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We shouldn't just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance, we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's the way we make the new economy work better for everybody.
2016,Obama,Democratic,I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don't have children."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But there are some areas where—we just have to be honest—it has been difficult to find agreement over the last 7 years.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the Government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And it's an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make."
2016,Obama,Democratic,I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.
2016,Obama,Democratic,I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed.
2016,Obama,Democratic,There is redtape that needs to be cut. [Applause] There you go!
2016,Obama,Democratic,Yes!
2016,Obama,Democratic,See?
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else's expense."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Immigrants aren't the principal reason wages haven't gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. [Laughter] The point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less."
2016,Obama,Democratic,The rules should work for them.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And I'm not alone in this.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And I want to spread those best practices across America.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's part of a brighter future.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"In fact, it turns, out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. [Laughter] We didn't argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We built a space program almost overnight.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And 12 years later, we were walking on the Moon."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA."
2016,Obama,Democratic,America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.
2016,Obama,Democratic,America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better future."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's who we are.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And over the past 7 years, we've nurtured that spirit."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We've protected an open Internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.
2016,Obama,Democratic,We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.
2016,Obama,Democratic,But we can do so much more.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they've had in over a decade."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Well—so tonight I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And because he's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I'm putting Joe in charge of mission control."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"For the loved ones we've all lost, for the families that we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"What do you say, Joe?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,Let's make it happen.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, medical research is critical."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. [Laughter] You will be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But even if the planet wasn't at stake, even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record—until 2015 turned out to be even hotter—why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?"
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Listen, 7 years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Here are the results.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy, something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Gas under 2 bucks a gallon ain't bad either. [Laughter] Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We do them no favor when we don't show them where the trends are going.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st-century transportation system."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, none of this is going to happen overnight."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, the planet we'll preserve—that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And it's within our grasp.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that's why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Period. [Applause] Period.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's not even close. [Applause] It's not even close.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's not even close.
2016,Obama,Democratic,We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. [Applause] All right.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that's the path to ruin."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead."
2016,Obama,Democratic,They call us.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"So I think it's useful to level set here, because when we don't, we don't make good decisions."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But that's not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it's certainly not because of diminished American strength."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And to do that well, it means that we've got to set priorities."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage."
2016,Obama,Democratic,They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies.
2016,Obama,Democratic,We have to take them out.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is world war III just play into their hands."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But they do not threaten our national existence.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That is the story ISIL wants to tell.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, and we sure don't need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world's largest religions."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that's exactly what we're doing.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"With nearly 10,000 airstrikes, we're taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We're training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Take a vote. [Applause] Take a vote.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"If you doubt America's commitment—or mine—to see that justice is done, just ask Usama bin Laden."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"When you come after Americans, we go after you."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can't stop there."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world: in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa and Asia."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it's done with the best of intentions."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us."
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's the lesson of Vietnam; it's the lesson of Iraq.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And we should have learned it by now.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Now, fortunately there is a smarter approach: a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Our military, our doctors, our development workers—they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million, lives were saved."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do."
2016,Obama,Democratic,You want to show our strength in this new century?
2016,Obama,Democratic,Approve this agreement.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Give us the tools to enforce it.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's the right thing to do.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Let me give you another example.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It set us back in Latin America.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Lift the embargo.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world—except when we kill terrorists—or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, it's the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Right now we're on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's within our grasp.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's American strength.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's American leadership.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies."
2016,Obama,Democratic,There's a better way.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that's why we need to reject any politics—any politics—that targets people because of race or religion.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Let me just say this.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"This is not a matter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"His Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I'm standing on tonight that ""to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place."" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn't make us safer."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's not telling it what—telling it like it is.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's just wrong.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It diminishes us in the eyes of the world.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It makes it harder to achieve our goals.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It betrays who we are as a country. ""We the People."" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, that that's how we might perfect our Union."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The future we want—all of us want—opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids—all that is within our reach."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But it will only happen if we work together.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates."
2016,Obama,Democratic,It will only happen if we fix our politics.
2016,Obama,Democratic,A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"This is a big country: different regions, different attitudes, different interests."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's one of our strengths too.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Our Founders distributed power between States and branches of government and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It doesn't work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter, that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Too many Americans feel that way right now.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's one of the few regrets of my Presidency: that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I have no doubt, a President with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee, I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task—or any President's—alone."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"There are a whole lot of folks in this Chamber, good people, who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base."
2016,Obama,Democratic,I know; you've told me.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's the worst kept secret in Washington.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And a lot of you aren't enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But that means if we want a better politics—and I'm addressing the American people now—if we want a better politics, it's not enough just to change a Congressman or change a Senator or even change a President."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We have to change the system to reflect our better selves.
2016,Obama,Democratic,I think we've got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Let a bipartisan group do it.
2016,Obama,Democratic,I believe we've got to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests can't bankroll our elections.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Because it's a problem.
2016,Obama,Democratic,And most of you don't like raising money. [Laughter] I know.
2016,Obama,Democratic,I've done it.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"We've got to make it easier to vote, not harder."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We need to modernize it for the way we live now.
2016,Obama,Democratic,This is America: We want to make it easier for people to participate.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that."
2016,Obama,Democratic,But I can't do these things on my own.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Changes in our political process—in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected—that will only happen when the American people demand it."
2016,Obama,Democratic,It depends on you.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people."
2016,Obama,Democratic,What I'm suggesting is hard.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"It's a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don't care; and to believe that our voices and our actions don't matter."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We can't afford to go down that path.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It won't deliver the economy we want.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It will not produce the security we want.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"So, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen."
2016,Obama,Democratic,To vote.
2016,Obama,Democratic,To speak out.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us."
2016,Obama,Democratic,We need every American to stay active in our public life—and not just during election time—so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.
2016,Obama,Democratic,It is not easy.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Our brand of democracy is hard.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Voices Dr.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"King believed would have the final word: voices of ""unarmed truth and unconditional love."" And they're out there, those voices."
2016,Obama,Democratic,They don't get a lot of attention; they don't seek a lot of fanfare; but they're busy doing the work this country needs doing.
2016,Obama,Democratic,I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I see you, the American people."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding."
2016,Obama,Democratic,I see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I see it in the dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I see it in the American who served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on."
2016,Obama,Democratic,It's the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he's been taught.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to, the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time, the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count."
2016,Obama,Democratic,"Because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth."
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's the America I know.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"That's the country we love: clear eyed, big hearted, undaunted by challenge."
2016,Obama,Democratic,Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
2016,Obama,Democratic,That's what makes me so hopeful about our future.
2016,Obama,Democratic,"I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people."
2016,Obama,Democratic,And that's why I stand here as confident as I have ever been that the state of our Union is strong.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2016,Obama,Democratic,God bless you.
2016,Obama,Democratic,God bless the United States of America.
2016,Obama,Democratic,Thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union February 05, 2019 The President."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Madam Speaker, Mr."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential."
2019,Trump,Republican,"As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great Chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties, but as one Nation."
2019,Trump,Republican,The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.
2019,Trump,Republican,It's the agenda of the American people.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of health care and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first."
2019,Trump,Republican,"There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage, together, to seize it."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country."
2019,Trump,Republican,"This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Eisenhower called the Great Crusade, the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II."
2019,Trump,Republican,"On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik."
2019,Trump,Republican,Please.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Gentlemen, we salute you."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the Moon."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Buzz."
2019,Trump,Republican,"This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century."
2019,Trump,Republican,An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.
2019,Trump,Republican,"We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before."
2019,Trump,Republican,"But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Together, we can break decades of political stalemate."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future."
2019,Trump,Republican,The decision is ours to make.
2019,Trump,Republican,"We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction."
2019,Trump,Republican,Tonight I ask you to choose greatness.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been seen before."
2019,Trump,Republican,There's been nothing like it.
2019,Trump,Republican,"We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something which almost everyone said was impossible to do."
2019,Trump,Republican,"But the fact is, we are just getting started."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for."
2019,Trump,Republican,They're growing faster than anyone else thought possible.
2019,Trump,Republican,Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.
2019,Trump,Republican,The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office.
2019,Trump,Republican,"And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world."
2019,Trump,Republican,Not even close.
2019,Trump,Republican,Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.
2019,Trump,Republican,"African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded."
2019,Trump,Republican,Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an alltime low.
2019,Trump,Republican,More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country: 157 million people at work.
2019,Trump,Republican,We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.
2019,Trump,Republican,"We virtually ended the estate tax—or death tax, as it is often called—on small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms."
2019,Trump,Republican,We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.
2019,Trump,Republican,"And to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly, ""right to try."" My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure."
2019,Trump,Republican,Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
2019,Trump,Republican,And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy.
2019,Trump,Republican,The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.
2019,Trump,Republican,"And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy."
2019,Trump,Republican,"After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and America is again winning each and every day."
2019,Trump,Republican,Members of Congress: The state of our union is strong.
2019,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,"That sounds so good. [Laughter] Our country is vibrant, and our economy is thriving like never before."
2019,Trump,Republican,"On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone, almost double the number expected."
2019,Trump,Republican,"An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations."
2019,Trump,Republican,"If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. [Laughter] It just doesn't work that way."
2019,Trump,Republican,We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.
2019,Trump,Republican,"This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases, years and years waiting."
2019,Trump,Republican,Not right.
2019,Trump,Republican,"The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country."
2019,Trump,Republican,Now is the time for bipartisan action.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Believe it or not, we have already proven that that's possible."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms."
2019,Trump,Republican,"And after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans."
2019,Trump,Republican,"And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform."
2019,Trump,Republican,They said it couldn't be done.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Last year, I heard, through friends, the story of Alice Johnson."
2019,Trump,Republican,I was deeply moved.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path."
2019,Trump,Republican,She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.
2019,Trump,Republican,Alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice.
2019,Trump,Republican,She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In June, I commuted Alice's sentence."
2019,Trump,Republican,"When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific woman."
2019,Trump,Republican,Terrific.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Alice, please."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Thank you very much, Alice."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Inspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law."
2019,Trump,Republican,Big deal.
2019,Trump,Republican,It's a big deal.
2019,Trump,Republican,This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.
2019,Trump,Republican,"The First Step Act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens."
2019,Trump,Republican,Now States across the country are following our lead.
2019,Trump,Republican,America is a nation that believes in redemption.
2019,Trump,Republican,We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates."
2019,Trump,Republican,Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Matthew, please."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Matthew."
2019,Trump,Republican,Welcome home.
2019,Trump,Republican,Now Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business."
2019,Trump,Republican,"As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection."
2019,Trump,Republican,"I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught."
2019,Trump,Republican,This is a moral issue.
2019,Trump,Republican,"The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all America."
2019,Trump,Republican,We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.
2019,Trump,Republican,This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws.
2019,Trump,Republican,Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.
2019,Trump,Republican,"I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally."
2019,Trump,Republican,Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
2019,Trump,Republican,No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration.
2019,Trump,Republican,Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
2019,Trump,Republican,Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel.
2019,Trump,Republican,One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.
2019,Trump,Republican,Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
2019,Trump,Republican,Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl."
2019,Trump,Republican,"The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border."
2019,Trump,Republican,Just yesterday an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City.
2019,Trump,Republican,We are removing these gang members by the thousands.
2019,Trump,Republican,"But until we secure our border, they're going to keep streaming right back in."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens."
2019,Trump,Republican,I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families.
2019,Trump,Republican,No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.
2019,Trump,Republican,Here tonight is Debra Bissell.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and Sharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien."
2019,Trump,Republican,"They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren."
2019,Trump,Republican,Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.
2019,Trump,Republican,"To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand."
2019,Trump,Republican,Few can understand your pain.
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,And thank you for being here.
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2019,Trump,Republican,"I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again."
2019,Trump,Republican,Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders."
2019,Trump,Republican,We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.
2019,Trump,Republican,When Elvin—[applause]—thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,"When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic."
2019,Trump,Republican,"At the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Elvin says that ""If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've really done my job."" Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Elvin."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border.
2019,Trump,Republican,"It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built."
2019,Trump,Republican,I will get it built.
2019,Trump,Republican,"This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall."
2019,Trump,Republican,It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need.
2019,Trump,Republican,"And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down."
2019,Trump,Republican,San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In response, a strong security wall was put in place."
2019,Trump,Republican,This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
2019,Trump,Republican,"The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime, one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives."
2019,Trump,Republican,"So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe."
2019,Trump,Republican,"As we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace."
2019,Trump,Republican,"No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year. [At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress, Cabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation.] You weren't supposed to do that."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much. [Laughter] All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before. [Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress and others in another standing ovation.] Don't sit yet.
2019,Trump,Republican,"You're going to like this. [Laughter] And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before."
2019,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,That's great.
2019,Trump,Republican,Really great.
2019,Trump,Republican,And congratulations.
2019,Trump,Republican,That's great.
2019,Trump,Republican,"As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever Governmentwide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries."
2019,Trump,Republican,To build on—[applause]—thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,"To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
2019,Trump,Republican,So bad.
2019,Trump,Republican,"We are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars."
2019,Trump,Republican,But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.
2019,Trump,Republican,"I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China."
2019,Trump,Republican,"But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. [Applause] Thank you."
2019,Trump,Republican,Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.
2019,Trump,Republican,"I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA."
2019,Trump,Republican,"For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven't had delivered to for a long time."
2019,Trump,Republican,"I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Tonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us."
2019,Trump,Republican,Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.
2019,Trump,Republican,"I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future."
2019,Trump,Republican,"This is not an option, this is a necessity."
2019,Trump,Republican,"The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with preexisting conditions."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years."
2019,Trump,Republican,But we must do more.
2019,Trump,Republican,"It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place."
2019,Trump,Republican,"This is wrong, this is unfair, and together, we will stop it, and we'll stop it fast."
2019,Trump,Republican,"I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down."
2019,Trump,Republican,No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS."
2019,Trump,Republican,Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach.
2019,Trump,Republican,My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.
2019,Trump,Republican,We have made incredible strides.
2019,Trump,Republican,Incredible.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond."
2019,Trump,Republican,Tonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline."
2019,Trump,Republican,Every birthday—[applause].
2019,Trump,Republican,"Hi, Grace. [Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St."
2019,Trump,Republican,Jude's Children's Hospital.
2019,Trump,Republican,She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself.
2019,Trump,Republican,That's what happened.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Immediately, she began radiation treatment."
2019,Trump,Republican,"At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer."
2019,Trump,Republican,"When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered—they loved her; they still love her—with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: ""Last day of chemo."" Thank you very much, Grace."
2019,Trump,Republican,You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room.
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2019,Trump,Republican,Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.
2019,Trump,Republican,My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.
2019,Trump,Republican,"To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for Americans' children."
2019,Trump,Republican,I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.
2019,Trump,Republican,Audience member.
2019,Trump,Republican,Yes!
2019,Trump,Republican,The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days.
2019,Trump,Republican,Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth.
2019,Trump,Republican,"These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world."
2019,Trump,Republican,"And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth."
2019,Trump,Republican,"To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb."
2019,Trump,Republican,Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.
2019,Trump,Republican,And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children—born and unborn—are made in the holy image of God.
2019,Trump,Republican,The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year."
2019,Trump,Republican,We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.
2019,Trump,Republican,Finally. [Applause] Finally.
2019,Trump,Republican,"For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO."
2019,Trump,Republican,"But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies."
2019,Trump,Republican,They said it couldn't be done.
2019,Trump,Republican,"As part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests."
2019,Trump,Republican,"For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability."
2019,Trump,Republican,"While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms."
2019,Trump,Republican,It's been going on for many years.
2019,Trump,Republican,"That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty."
2019,Trump,Republican,Perhaps—[applause]—we really have no choice.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we will outspend and outinnovate all others by far."
2019,Trump,Republican,"As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months."
2019,Trump,Republican,"If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one."
2019,Trump,Republican,Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate Government of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaidó."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country."
2019,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2019,Trump,Republican,Boo!
2019,Trump,Republican,The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,"America was founded on liberty and independence and not Government coercion, domination, and control."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We are born free, and we will stay free."
2019,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
2019,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2019,Trump,Republican,The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,"One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress."
2019,Trump,Republican,"For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem."
2019,Trump,Republican,Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.
2019,Trump,Republican,"In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives."
2019,Trump,Republican,"More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded."
2019,Trump,Republican,We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.
2019,Trump,Republican,"As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach."
2019,Trump,Republican,Great nations do not fight endless wars.
2019,Trump,Republican,"When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home."
2019,Trump,Republican,I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach—if possible—a political settlement in Afghanistan.
2019,Trump,Republican,The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating.
2019,Trump,Republican,Our troops have fought with unmatched valor.
2019,Trump,Republican,"And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict."
2019,Trump,Republican,"In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban."
2019,Trump,Republican,"As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and focus on counterterrorism."
2019,Trump,Republican,And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.
2019,Trump,Republican,"We do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace."
2019,Trump,Republican,And the other side would like to do the same thing.
2019,Trump,Republican,It's time.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole."
2019,Trump,Republican,"And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Tom."
2019,Trump,Republican,My administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.
2019,Trump,Republican,It is a radical regime.
2019,Trump,Republican,"They do bad, bad things."
2019,Trump,Republican,"To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal."
2019,Trump,Republican,"And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants ""Death to America"" and threatens genocide against the Jewish people."
2019,Trump,Republican,We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.
2019,Trump,Republican,"With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Just months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh."
2019,Trump,Republican,SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer.
2019,Trump,Republican,And he was very successful.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more."
2019,Trump,Republican,But he made the trip to be here with us tonight.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Officer Matson, please."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,We are forever grateful.
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Tonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet."
2019,Trump,Republican,He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began.
2019,Trump,Republican,"But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Today is Judah's 81st birthday. [Audience members sang ""Happy Birthday.""] The President. [Laughter] Great."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Pittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you! [Laughter] The President.
2019,Trump,Republican,"They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter] Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt."
2019,Trump,Republican,A soldier appeared.
2019,Trump,Republican,Judah's family braced for the absolute worst.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Then, his father cried out with joy: ""It's the Americans!"
2019,Trump,Republican,"It's the Americans!"" [Applause] Thank you."
2019,Trump,Republican,"A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau."
2019,Trump,Republican,"He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. ""To me,"" Joshua recalls, ""the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky."" They came down from Heaven."
2019,Trump,Republican,I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War.
2019,Trump,Republican,One of them was Herman Zeitchik.
2019,Trump,Republican,But there is more to Herman's story.
2019,Trump,Republican,"A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau."
2019,Trump,Republican,He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you.
2019,Trump,Republican,"When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war."
2019,Trump,Republican,They did not know if they would survive the hour.
2019,Trump,Republican,They did not know if they would grow old.
2019,Trump,Republican,But they knew that America had to prevail.
2019,Trump,Republican,Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.
2019,Trump,Republican,Why did they do it?
2019,Trump,Republican,They did it for America.
2019,Trump,Republican,They did it for us.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Everything that has come since—our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before."
2019,Trump,Republican,Think of this Capitol.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic."
2019,Trump,Republican,You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.
2019,Trump,Republican,"Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history."
2019,Trump,Republican,What will we do with this moment?
2019,Trump,Republican,How will we be remembered?
2019,Trump,Republican,I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us.
2019,Trump,Republican,Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead.
2019,Trump,Republican,Our most exciting journeys still await.
2019,Trump,Republican,Our biggest victories are still to come.
2019,Trump,Republican,We have not yet begun to dream.
2019,Trump,Republican,We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.
2019,Trump,Republican,We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.
2019,Trump,Republican,We do the incredible.
2019,Trump,Republican,We defy the impossible.
2019,Trump,Republican,We conquer the unknown.
2019,Trump,Republican,This is the time to reignite the American imagination.
2019,Trump,Republican,This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.
2019,Trump,Republican,"This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots."
2019,Trump,Republican,"This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make."
2019,Trump,Republican,I am asking you to choose greatness.
2019,Trump,Republican,"No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together."
2019,Trump,Republican,"We must keep America first in our hearts, we must keep freedom alive in our souls, and we must always keep faith in America's destiny that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world."
2019,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2019,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union February 04, 2020 The President."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Madam Speaker, Mr."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens: Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again."
2020,Trump,Republican,"America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright."
2020,Trump,Republican,The years of economic decay are over.
2020,Trump,Republican,"The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny."
2020,Trump,Republican,We have totally rejected the downsizing.
2020,Trump,Republican,"We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back."
2020,Trump,Republican,I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world, and it's not even close."
2020,Trump,Republican,Our borders are secure.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our families are flourishing.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our values are renewed.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our pride is restored.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the Members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society, one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise."
2020,Trump,Republican,"From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy, slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. [Applause] Thank you."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,"We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration."
2020,Trump,Republican,The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. [Applause] True."
2020,Trump,Republican,"If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history."
2020,Trump,Republican,African American youth unemployment has reached an alltime low.
2020,Trump,Republican,African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
2020,Trump,Republican,The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added."
2020,Trump,Republican,The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low.
2020,Trump,Republican,The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an alltime low.
2020,Trump,Republican,Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history.
2020,Trump,Republican,A record number of young Americans are now employed.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In just 3 years of my administration, 3.5 million people—working-age people—have joined the workforce."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent, three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent."
2020,Trump,Republican,"After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast, and wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16-percent pay increase since my election."
2020,Trump,Republican,This is a blue-collar boom.
2020,Trump,Republican,Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Since my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible."
2020,Trump,Republican,This is a record.
2020,Trump,Republican,It is something that every country in the world is looking up to.
2020,Trump,Republican,They admire.
2020,Trump,Republican,Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs.
2020,Trump,Republican,"All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent and even more."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement."
2020,Trump,Republican,This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this.
2020,Trump,Republican,It's all working.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio."
2020,Trump,Republican,"After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family."
2020,Trump,Republican,He was homeless.
2020,Trump,Republican,"But then, Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones."
2020,Trump,Republican,"He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Tony, keep up the great work."
2020,Trump,Republican,Tony.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Tony."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start."
2020,Trump,Republican,This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far."
2020,Trump,Republican,"With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high."
2020,Trump,Republican,We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Likewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done."
2020,Trump,Republican,"After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built."
2020,Trump,Republican,Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the U.S.A.
2020,Trump,Republican,"The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is."
2020,Trump,Republican,One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal.
2020,Trump,Republican,"In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened."
2020,Trump,Republican,"But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises: We did our job."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers."
2020,Trump,Republican,"It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity."
2020,Trump,Republican,We will have that: fairness and reciprocity.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And I say that, finally, because it's been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade."
2020,Trump,Republican,This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.
2020,Trump,Republican,I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our strategy has worked.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the U.S.A."
2020,Trump,Republican,"For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi."
2020,Trump,Republican,"They respect what we've done, because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, ""That's enough."" Now we want to rebuild our country, and that's exactly what we're doing."
2020,Trump,Republican,We are rebuilding our country.
2020,Trump,Republican,"As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere."
2020,Trump,Republican,That's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.
2020,Trump,Republican,"We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people."
2020,Trump,Republican,But Maduro's grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó."
2020,Trump,Republican,Mr.
2020,Trump,Republican,"President, please take this message back to your homeland."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Mr."
2020,Trump,Republican,President.
2020,Trump,Republican,Great honor.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you very much, Mr."
2020,Trump,Republican,President.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,Socialism destroys nations.
2020,Trump,Republican,But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul.
2020,Trump,Republican,"To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military."
2020,Trump,Republican,"We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it's all made right here in the U.S.A."
2020,Trump,Republican,"We are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces."
2020,Trump,Republican,It's called the Space Force.
2020,Trump,Republican,Very important.
2020,Trump,Republican,"In the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman."
2020,Trump,Republican,And what he wants so badly—13 years old—Iain Lanphier.
2020,Trump,Republican,He's an eighth grader from Arizona.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Iain, please stand up."
2020,Trump,Republican,Iain has always dreamed of going to space.
2020,Trump,Republican,He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy.
2020,Trump,Republican,"He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force."
2020,Trump,Republican,"As Iain says: ""Most people look up at space."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I want to look down on the world."" [Laughter] But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago."
2020,Trump,Republican,Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen—the first Black fighter pilots—and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather.
2020,Trump,Republican,Incredible story.
2020,Trump,Republican,"After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam."
2020,Trump,Republican,"On December 7, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday."
2020,Trump,Republican,"A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General."
2020,Trump,Republican,And earlier today I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office.
2020,Trump,Republican,"General McGee, our Nation salutes you."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, sir."
2020,Trump,Republican,"From the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country."
2020,Trump,Republican,We must always remember that our job is to put America first.
2020,Trump,Republican,The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools."
2020,Trump,Republican,"To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships."
2020,Trump,Republican,The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.
2020,Trump,Republican,"One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia."
2020,Trump,Republican,Janiyah.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Janiyah's mom, Stephanie, is a single parent."
2020,Trump,Republican,She would do anything to give her daughter a better future.
2020,Trump,Republican,"But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children."
2020,Trump,Republican,Janiyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,"But, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I can proudly announce tonight that an ""opportunity scholarship"" has become available, it's going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice."
2020,Trump,Republican,Now I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act, because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school."
2020,Trump,Republican,Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow.
2020,Trump,Republican,"For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the ""Be Best"" initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation: online, in school, and in our communities."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans."
2020,Trump,Republican,My budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools.
2020,Trump,Republican,Tonight I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.
2020,Trump,Republican,"To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities."
2020,Trump,Republican,"A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality health care system on Earth."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years."
2020,Trump,Republican,I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our new plans are up to 60-percent less expensive and better.
2020,Trump,Republican,I've also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And we will always protect your Medicare, and we will always protect your Social Security."
2020,Trump,Republican,Always.
2020,Trump,Republican,The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills.
2020,Trump,Republican,That is why I signed an Executive order requiring price transparency.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than health care reform."
2020,Trump,Republican,It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.
2020,Trump,Republican,"But as we work to improve Americans' health care, there are those who want to take away your health care, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely."
2020,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2020,Trump,Republican,Boo!
2020,Trump,Republican,The President.
2020,Trump,Republican,"One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans."
2020,Trump,Republican,"To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Over 130 legislators in this Chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders."
2020,Trump,Republican,"These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors, and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration."
2020,Trump,Republican,That is what is happening in California and other States.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money."
2020,Trump,Republican,"If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left."
2020,Trump,Republican,"But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government health care for illegal aliens."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built."
2020,Trump,Republican,We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed."
2020,Trump,Republican,My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies.
2020,Trump,Republican,"We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I've been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly."
2020,Trump,Republican,I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately."
2020,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2020,Trump,Republican,H.R. 3!
2020,Trump,Republican,H.R. 3!
2020,Trump,Republican,H.R. 3!
2020,Trump,Republican,The President.
2020,Trump,Republican,"With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic."
2020,Trump,Republican,Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent, and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all."
2020,Trump,Republican,Protecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases.
2020,Trump,Republican,We are coordinating with the Chinese Government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.
2020,Trump,Republican,My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.
2020,Trump,Republican,"We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade."
2020,Trump,Republican,Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage-4 advanced cancer diagnosis."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
2020,Trump,Republican,I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Please. [At this point, the First Lady presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to radio show host Rush H."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Limbaugh III, who was seated beside her in the House Gallery.] Audience member."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Rush! [Applause] The President."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Rush and Kathryn, congratulations."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Kathryn."
2020,Trump,Republican,"As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In 2017, doctors at St."
2020,Trump,Republican,Luke's Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight."
2020,Trump,Republican,Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive."
2020,Trump,Republican,It's an incredible thing.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie.
2020,Trump,Republican,That is why I'm asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America's youngest patients.
2020,Trump,Republican,That is why I'm also calling upon Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God."
2020,Trump,Republican,"As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Now I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our Nation."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I've also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality childcare, enabling 17 States to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait-lists altogether."
2020,Trump,Republican,And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.
2020,Trump,Republican,"To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the 1 Trillion Trees initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world."
2020,Trump,Republican,We must also rebuild America's infrastructure.
2020,Trump,Republican,"I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso's highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I'm also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including and especially in rural America."
2020,Trump,Republican,A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe.
2020,Trump,Republican,"That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens."
2020,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2020,Trump,Republican,Boo!
2020,Trump,Republican,The President.
2020,Trump,Republican,"In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free."
2020,Trump,Republican,"If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would still be alive today."
2020,Trump,Republican,The State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants—a very terrible sanctuary—with catastrophic results.
2020,Trump,Republican,Here is just one tragic example.
2020,Trump,Republican,"In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault."
2020,Trump,Republican,"But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence."
2020,Trump,Republican,He viciously shot one man going about his daily work.
2020,Trump,Republican,He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest.
2020,Trump,Republican,He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon.
2020,Trump,Republican,"He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims."
2020,Trump,Republican,"One of the victims is—a terrible, terrible situation; died—51-year-old American named Rocky Jones."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world."
2020,Trump,Republican,One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Jody, would you please stand?"
2020,Trump,Republican,Audience member.
2020,Trump,Republican,Jody!
2020,Trump,Republican,The President.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Jody, thank you."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice."
2020,Trump,Republican,Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices.
2020,Trump,Republican,I ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately.
2020,Trump,Republican,"The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe."
2020,Trump,Republican,My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again."
2020,Trump,Republican,My administration has ended catch-and-release.
2020,Trump,Republican,"If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala."
2020,Trump,Republican,"As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping 8 straight months in a row."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Chief Ortiz, please stand."
2020,Trump,Republican,A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,"To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values."
2020,Trump,Republican,"With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—thank you, Mitch—and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And we have many in the pipeline. [Laughter] My administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In America, we don't punish prayer."
2020,Trump,Republican,We don't tear down crosses.
2020,Trump,Republican,We don't ban symbols of faith.
2020,Trump,Republican,We don't muzzle preachers and pastors.
2020,Trump,Republican,"In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the glory of God."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country."
2020,Trump,Republican,"So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts, using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars."
2020,Trump,Republican,My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS—the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi—is dead."
2020,Trump,Republican,We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller.
2020,Trump,Republican,"After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker."
2020,Trump,Republican,"She once wrote: ""Some people find God in church."
2020,Trump,Republican,Some people find God in nature.
2020,Trump,Republican,Some people find God in love.
2020,Trump,Republican,I find God in suffering.
2020,Trump,Republican,"I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering."" In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself."
2020,Trump,Republican,"After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla."
2020,Trump,Republican,She was just 26 years old.
2020,Trump,Republican,On the night that U.S.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room."
2020,Trump,Republican,"He was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: ""Task Force 8–14."" It was a reference to a special day: August 14, Kayla's birthday."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla, and neither will we."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Every day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart."
2020,Trump,Republican,One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake.
2020,Trump,Republican,"On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: ""I will be with you again,"" he wrote to Gage. ""I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sandbox, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I love you, son."
2020,Trump,Republican,Take care of your mother.
2020,Trump,Republican,I am always with you.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Daddy."" On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb."
2020,Trump,Republican,"That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well."
2020,Trump,Republican,To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.
2020,Trump,Republican,He is looking down on you now.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you both very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,"The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American servicemembers in Iraq."
2020,Trump,Republican,"As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children."
2020,Trump,Republican,He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq.
2020,Trump,Republican,Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And that's why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever."
2020,Trump,Republican,Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice.
2020,Trump,Republican,"If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly."
2020,Trump,Republican,We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery.
2020,Trump,Republican,"It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help."
2020,Trump,Republican,We are here.
2020,Trump,Republican,Let's see which road they choose.
2020,Trump,Republican,It is totally up to them.
2020,Trump,Republican,"As we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East."
2020,Trump,Republican,"In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway."
2020,Trump,Republican,"I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent."
2020,Trump,Republican,It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies.
2020,Trump,Republican,These are warfighters that we have—the best in the world—and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.
2020,Trump,Republican,We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home.
2020,Trump,Republican,"War places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children, 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan."
2020,Trump,Republican,Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families.
2020,Trump,Republican,"For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East."
2020,Trump,Republican,Amy's kids haven't seen their father's face in many months.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, Amy."
2020,Trump,Republican,"But, Amy, there is one more thing."
2020,Trump,Republican,Tonight we have a very special surprise.
2020,Trump,Republican,I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment.
2020,Trump,Republican,"He is here with us tonight, and we couldn't keep him waiting any longer."
2020,Trump,Republican,Audience members.
2020,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2020,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2020,Trump,Republican,U.S.A.!
2020,Trump,Republican,The President.
2020,Trump,Republican,"Welcome home, Sergeant Williams."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.
2020,Trump,Republican,"As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo—[applause]—the beautiful, beautiful Alamo."
2020,Trump,Republican,"The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers."
2020,Trump,Republican,"And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before."
2020,Trump,Republican,This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.
2020,Trump,Republican,We are Americans.
2020,Trump,Republican,We are pioneers.
2020,Trump,Republican,We are the pathfinders.
2020,Trump,Republican,"We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God."
2020,Trump,Republican,America is the place where anything can happen.
2020,Trump,Republican,America is the place where anyone can rise.
2020,Trump,Republican,"And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true."
2020,Trump,Republican,"This Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece."
2020,Trump,Republican,We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our brightest discoveries are not yet known.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our most thrilling stories are not yet told.
2020,Trump,Republican,Our grandest journeys are not yet made.
2020,Trump,Republican,"The American age, the American epic, the American adventure has only just begun."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Our spirit is still young, the Sun is still rising, God's grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come."
2020,Trump,Republican,"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
2020,Trump,Republican,Thank you very much.

2023,Biden,Democratic,"Members of the Cabinet, leaders of our military, Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court, and to you, my fellow Americans: You know, I start tonight by congratulating the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Speaker, I don't want to ruin your reputation, but I look forward to working with you. [Laughter] And I want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats, the first African American minority leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries."

2023,Biden,Democratic,"And congratulations to Chuck Schumer, another—you know, another term as Senate minority [majority; White House correction] leader."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know, I think you—only this time you have a slightly bigger majority, Mr."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Leader.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And you're the majority leader.
2023,Biden,Democratic,About that much bigger? [Laughter] Yes.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Well, I tell you what, I want to give special recognition to someone who I think is going to be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of the House of Representatives: Nancy Pelosi."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, the story of America is a story of progress and resilience, of always moving forward, of never, ever giving up."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's a story unique among all nations.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're the only country that has emerged from every crisis we've ever entered stronger than we got into it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, folks, that's what we're doing again."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Two years ago, the economy was reeling."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I stand here tonight, after we've created, with the help of many people in this room, 12 million new jobs—more jobs created in 2 years than any President has created in 4 years—because of you all, because of the American people."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Two years ago—[applause].
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And 2 years ago, COVID had shut down—our businesses were closed, our schools were robbed of so much."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And today, COVID no longer controls our lives."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And 2 years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"As we gather here tonight, we're writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"When world leaders ask me to define America—and they do, believe it or not—I say I can define it in one word, and I mean this: possibilities."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We don't think anything is beyond our capacity.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Everything is a possibility.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know, we're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But over the past 2 years, we've proved the cynics and naysayers wrong."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Yes, we disagreed plenty."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And yes, there were times when Democrats went alone."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.
2023,Biden,Democratic,You came together to pass one-in-a-generation—once-in-a-generation infrastructure law building bridges connecting our Nation and our people.

2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, in fact—[applause]."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's important.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, in fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan pieces of legislation since becoming President, from reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to the Electoral Count Reform Act, the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And to my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there's no reason we can't work together and find consensus on important things in this Congress as well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I think—folks, you all are as informed as I am, but I think the people sent us a clear message: Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict gets us nowhere."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"That's always been my vision of our country, and I know it's many of yours: to restore the soul of this Nation; to rebuild the backbone of America, America's middle class; and to unite the country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We've been sent here to finish the job, in my view."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For decades, the middle class has been hollowed out in more than—and not in one administration, but for a long time."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Factories closed down.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And along the way, something else we lost: pride, our sense of self-worth."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I ran for President to fundamentally change things.
2023,Biden,Democratic,To make sure our economy works for everyone so we can all feel that pride in what we do.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up, and the wealthy still do very well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We all do well.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I know a lot of you always kid me for always quoting my dad.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" Because he really would say this. ""It's about a lot more than a paycheck."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's about your dignity.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's about respect.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" Well, folks, so let's look at the results."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're not finished yet, by any stretch of the imagination."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But unemployment rate is at 3.4 percent, a 50-year low."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And near record—and near record unemployment—near record unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We've already created, with your help, 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And where is it written—where is it written that America can't lead the world in manufacturing?
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I don't know where that's written.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For too many decades, we imported projects and exported jobs."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Now, thanks to what you've all done, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, inflation—inflation has been a global problem because the pandemic disrupted our supply chains, and Putin's unfair and brutal war in Ukraine disrupted energy supplies as well as food supplies, blocking all that grain in Ukraine."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But we're better positioned than any country on Earth right now.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But we have more to do.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But here at home, inflation is coming down."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 from their peak."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Food inflation is coming down, not fast enough, but coming down."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Inflation has fallen every month for the last 6 months, while take-home pay has gone up."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Additionally, over the last 2 years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start new businesses."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Ten million.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, every time—every time someone starts a small business, it's an act of hope."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, Madam Vice President, I want to thank you for leading that effort to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and the historic laws we enacted that are going to just come into being."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibilities."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Semiconductors—small computer chips the size of a fingerprint that power everything from cellphones to automobiles and so much more—these chips were invented in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's get that straight: They were invented in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we used to make 40 percent of the world's chips.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"In the last several decades, we lost our edge."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're down to only producing 10 percent.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories shut down overseas.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Today's automobiles need 3,000 chips—each of those automobiles—but American automobiles [automakers; White House correction] couldn't make enough cars because there weren't enough chips."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Car prices went up.
2023,Biden,Democratic,People got laid off.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So did everything from refrigerators to cell phones.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We can never let that happen again.
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's why—that's why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, I know I've been criticized for saying this, but I'm not changing my view."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're going to make sure the supply chain for America begins in America—the supply chain begins in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we've already created—[applause].
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We've already created 800,000 new manufacturing jobs without this law, before the law kicks in."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"With this new law, we're going to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And I mean all across the country, throughout—not just the coast, but through the middle of the country as well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investment in American manufacturing over the next few years.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres, literally a ""field of dreams."" It's going to create 10,000 jobs, that one investment; 7,000 construction jobs; 3,000 jobs in those factories once they're finished."
2023,Biden,Democratic,They call them factors.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Jobs paying an average of $130,000 a year, and many do not require a college degree."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And jobs—because we worked together, these jobs where people don't have to leave home to search for opportunity."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And it's just getting started.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Think about the new homes, the small businesses, the big—the medium-sized businesses."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"So much more that's going to be needed to support those 3,000 permanent jobs and the factories that are going to be built."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they'll tell you what this means for their communities."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're seeing these ""fields of dreams"" transform the Heartland."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, folks, as you all know, we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've sunk to 13th in the world.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"The United States of America—13th in the world in infrastructure, modern infrastructure."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But now we're coming back because we came together and passed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, folks, already, we've funded over 20,000 projects, including major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland, projects that are going to put thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, our bridges, our railroads, our tunnels, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet all across America: urban, rural, Tribal."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, folks, we're just getting started."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're just getting started.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I mean this sincerely: I want to thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And my Republican friends who voted against it as well—but I'm still—I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well, but don't worry. [Laughter] I promised I'd be a President for all Americans."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We'll fund these projects.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I'll see you at the groundbreaking.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, this law—this law will further unite all of America."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Projects like Brent Spence Bridge in Kentucky over the Ohio River, built 60 years ago, badly in need of repairs."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"One of the Nation's most congested freight routes, carrying $2 billion worth of freight every single day across the Ohio River."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, folks, we've been talking about fixing it for decades, but we're really finally going to get it done."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans in—from both States—to deliver a commitment of $1.6 billion for this project.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And while I was there, I met a young woman named Saria, who's here tonight."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I don't know where Saria is.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Is she up in the box?
2023,Biden,Democratic,I don't know.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Saria, how are you?"
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Well, Saria—for 30 years—for 30 years—I learned—she told me she'd been a proud member of the Ironworkers Local 44, known as—known as the ""Cowboys in the Sky""—the folks who built Cincinnati's skyline."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Saria said she can't wait to be 10 stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge.
2023,Biden,Democratic,God bless her. [Laughter] That's pride.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And that's what we're also building: We're building back pride.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, we're also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes in America, 400,000 schools and childcare centers so every child in America—every child in American—can drink the water, instead of having permanent damage to their brain."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, we're making sure—[applause]—we're making sure that every community—every community in America—has access to affordable, high-speed internet."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"No parent should have to drive by a McDonald's parking lot to help their—do their homework online with their kids, which many—thousands were doing across the country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And when we do these projects—and, again, I get criticized about this, but I make no excuses for it—we're going to buy American."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're going to buy American.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Folks—[applause]—and it's totally—it's totally—consistent with international trade rules.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Buy American has been the law since 1933.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But for too long, past administrations—Democrat and Republican—have fought to get around it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Tonight I'm announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in Federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Made in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I mean it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Lumber, glass, drywall, fiber-optic cable."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And on my watch, American roads, bridges, and American highways are going to be made with American products as well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, my economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"So many of you listening tonight, I know you feel it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,So many of you felt like you've just simply been forgotten.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind and treated like they're invisible."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Maybe that's you, watching from home."
2023,Biden,Democratic,You remember the jobs that went away.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You remember them, don't you?"
2023,Biden,Democratic,The folks at home remember them.
2023,Biden,Democratic,You wonder whether the path even exists anymore for your children to get ahead without having to move away.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Well, that's why—I get that."
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's why we're building an economy where no one is left behind.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of choices we made in the last several years."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know, this is, in my view, a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives at home."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For example, too many of you lay in bed at night, like my dad did, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God's name happens if your spouse gets cancer or your child gets deadly ill or if something happens to you."
2023,Biden,Democratic,What are you going—are you going to have the money to pay for those medical bills?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Are you going to have to sell the house or try to get a second mortgage on it?
2023,Biden,Democratic,I get it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I get it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we're taking on powerful interests to bring health care costs down so you can sleep better at night with more security."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any nation in the world."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let me say it again: We pay more for prescription drugs than any major nation on Earth.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For example, 1 in 10 Americans has diabetes."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Many of you in this chamber do and in the audience.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can literally stay alive."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Insulin has been around for over 100 years.
2023,Biden,Democratic,The guy who invented it didn't even patent it because he wanted it to be available for everyone.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It costs the drug companies roughly $10 a vial to make that insulin.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Package it and all, you may get up to $13."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars, $4- to $500 a month, making record profits."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So many things that we did are only now coming to fruition.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We said we were doing this, and we said we'd pass the law to do it, but people didn't know because the law didn't take effect until January 1 of this year."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But people are just finding out.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'm sure you're getting the same calls I'm getting.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, there are millions of other Americans who do not—are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with type 1 diabetes who need these insulin—need this insulin to stay alive."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's finish the job this time.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's cap the cost of insulin for everybody at $35.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks—and Big Pharma is still going to do very well, I promise you all. [Laughter] I promise you they're going to do very well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,This law also—this law also caps—and it won't even go into effect until 2025.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"It costs [caps; White House correction] out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum of $2,000 a year."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter how much your drug costs are."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Because you know why?
2023,Biden,Democratic,You all know it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Many of you, like many of my family, have cancer."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know the drugs can range from $10-, $11-, $14-, $15,000 for the cancer drugs."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And if drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies are going to have to pay Medicare back the difference."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we're finally—we're finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Bringing down—bringing down prescription drug costs doesn't just save seniors money, it cuts the Federal deficit by billions of dollars—[applause]—by hundreds of billions of dollars because these prescription drugs are drugs purchased by Medicare to make—keep their commitment to the seniors."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Well, guess what?"
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Instead of paying 4- or 500 bucks a month, you're paying 15."
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's a lot of savings for the Federal Government.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, why wouldn't we want that?"
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Now, some Members here are threatening—and I know it's not an official party position, so I'm not going to exaggerate—but threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act."
2023,Biden,Democratic,As my coach—that's okay.
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's fair.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"As my football coach used to say, ""Lots of luck in your senior year."" [Laughter] Make no mistake, if you try anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And look, I'm pleased to say that more Americans health—have health insurance now than ever in history."
2023,Biden,Democratic,A record 16 million people are enrolled in the Affordable Care Act.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And thanks to the law I signed last year, saving—millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, that law was written—and the benefit expires in 2025."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"So my plea to some of you, at least in this audience: Let's finish the job and make these savings permanent."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Expand coverage on Medicaid.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever in climate change—ever."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, leading the world to a clean energy future."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I visited the devastating aftermath of record floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires from Arizona to New Mexico to all the way up to the Canadian border."
2023,Biden,Democratic,More timber has been burned that I've observed from helicopters than the entire State of Missouri.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we don't have global warming?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not a problem.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we're rebuilding for the long term."
2023,Biden,Democratic,New electric grids that are able to weather major storms and not—prevent those fire—forest fires.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities often left behind.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're going to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And we're helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits to purchase electric vehicles and efficient—and efficient appliances—energy-efficient appliances."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our land.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's face reality.
2023,Biden,Democratic,The climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or a blue State.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's an existential threat.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We have an obligation not to ourselves, but to our children and our grandchildren to confront it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I'm proud of how the—how America, at last, is stepping up to the challenge."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're still going to need oil and gas for a while, but guess what—[applause]—no, we do—but there's so much more to do."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've got to finish the job.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Just begin.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, I'm a capitalist."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'm a capitalist.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But pay your fair share.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I think a lot of you at home—a lot of you at home—agree with me and many people that you know: The tax system is not fair.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It is not fair.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, the idea that in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America, the Fortune 500, made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in Federal taxes?"
2023,Biden,Democratic,Zero.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, it's simply not fair."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent."
2023,Biden,Democratic,God love them.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Fifteen percent.
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's less than a nurse pays.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And let me be crystal clear.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I said at the very beginning: Under my plans, as long as I'm President, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in taxes."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Nobody.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not one penny.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But let's finish the job.
2023,Biden,Democratic,There's more to do.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We have to reward work, not just wealth."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Pass my proposal for the billionaire minimum tax.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know, there's a thousand billionaires in America—it's up from about 600 at the beginning of my term—but no billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a schoolteacher or a firefighter."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"No, I mean it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Think about it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I mean, look, I know you all aren't enthusiastic about that, but think about it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Think about it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Have you noticed?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Big Oil just reported its profits.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Record profits.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I think it's outrageous.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Why?
2023,Biden,Democratic,They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And when I talked to a couple of them, they say, ""We were afraid you were going to shut down all the oil wells and all the oil refineries anyway, so why should we invest in them?"" I said, ""We're going to need oil for at least another decade, and that's going to exceed""—[laughter]—and beyond that."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're going to need it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Production.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"If they had, in fact, invested in the production to keep gas prices down—instead they used the record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Corporations ought to do the right thing.
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's why I propose we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks and encourage long-term investments.
2023,Biden,Democratic,They'll still make considerable profit.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Instead of cutting the number of audits for wealthy taxpayers, I just signed a law to reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats."
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's being fiscally responsible.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"In the last 2 years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up 4 years in a row."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Because of those record deficits, no President added more to the national debt in any 4 years than my predecessor."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Nearly 25 percent of the entire national debt that took over 200 years to accumulate was added by just one administration alone, the last one."
2023,Biden,Democratic,They're the facts.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Check it out.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Check it out.
2023,Biden,Democratic,How did Congress respond to that debt?
2023,Biden,Democratic,They did the right thing.
2023,Biden,Democratic,They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.
2023,Biden,Democratic,They paid the American bill to prevent an economic disaster to the country.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So tonight I'm asking the Congress to follow suit.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Let's commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned."
2023,Biden,Democratic,So my—many of—some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage—I get it—unless I agree to their economic plans.
2023,Biden,Democratic,All of you at home should know what those plans are.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'm not saying it's a majority—— Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let me give you—— Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,No!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Anybody who doubts it, contact my office."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'll give you a copy.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'll give you a copy of the proposal.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Liar!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"That means Congress doesn't vote—— Well, I'm glad to see—no, I tell you, I enjoy conversion. [Laughter] You know, it means if Congress doesn't keep the programs the way they are, they'd go away."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Other Republicans say—I'm not saying it's a majority of you.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I don't even think it's a significant—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—don't say—— The President. ——but it's being proposed by individuals.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience member.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But you don't say who.
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I'm not—politely not naming them, but it's being proposed by some of you."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members. [Inaudible] Rep.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Greene.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Liar, liar!"
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, folks, the idea is that we're not going to be—we're not going to be moved into being threatened to default on the debt if we don't respond."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks—[applause]—so, folks, as we all apparently agree, Social Security and Medicare is off the books now, right?"
2023,Biden,Democratic,They're not to be touched? [Applause] All right.
2023,Biden,Democratic,All right.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've got unanimity!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Americans have to pay into them from the very first paycheck they've started.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So tonight let's all agree—and we apparently are—let's stand up for seniors.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We will not cut Medicare.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Those benefits belong to the American people.
2023,Biden,Democratic,They earned it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And if anyone tries to cut Social Security—which apparently no one is going to do—[laughter]—and if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I'll stop them."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'll veto it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And look, I'm not going to allow them to take away—be taken away."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not today.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not tomorrow.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not ever.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But apparently, it's not going to be a problem. [Laughter] Next month, when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to lay down their plan as well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I really mean it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's sit down together and discuss our mutual plans together.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's do that.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I can tell you, the plan I'm going to show you is going to cut the deficit by another $2 trillion."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And it won't cut a single bit of Medicare or Social Security.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"In fact, we're going to extend the Medicare Trust Fund at least two decades, because that's going to be the next argument: how do we make—keep it solvent."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Right?
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Well, I will not raise taxes on anyone making under 400 grand."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But we'll pay for it the way we talked about tonight: by making sure that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look—look, look, here's the deal."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"They aren't just taking advantage of the Tax Code, they're taking advantage of you, the American consumer."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Here's my message to all of you out there: I have your back.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're already preventing Americans who are [from; White House correction] receiving surprise medical bills, stopping 1 billion dollar surprise bills [1 million surprise bills; White House correction] per month so far."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're protecting seniors' life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs that are not needed."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get a hearing aid over the counter without a prescription.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, capitalism without competition is not capitalism, it's extortion; it's exploitation."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Last year, I cracked down, with the help of many of you, on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for every good coming into the country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90 percent, helping American farmers, businessmen, and consumers."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's finish the job.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Pass the bipartisan legislation to strengthen and—to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"My administration is also taking on junk fees, those hidden surcharges too many companies use to make you pay more."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For example, we're making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront, refund your money if your flight is canceled or delayed."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've reduced exorbitant bank overdrafts by saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're cutting credit card late fees by 75 percent, from $30 to $8."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most other folks in homes like the one I grew up in, like many of you did."
2023,Biden,Democratic,They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.
2023,Biden,Democratic,They make it harder for you to pay your bills or afford that family trip.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've written a bill to stop it all.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're going to ban surprise resort fees that hotels charge on your bill.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Those fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren't even resorts. [Laughter] We—the idea that cable, internet, and cell phone companies can charge you $200 or more if you decide to switch to another provider."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Give me a break.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We can stop service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all the fees upfront.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we'll prohibit airlines from charging $50 roundtrip for a family just to be able to sit together.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Baggage fees are bad enough.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Americans are tired of being—we're tired of being played for suckers.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For too long, workers have been getting stiffed, but not anymore."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're going to be—we're beginning to restore the dignity of work.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For example, I should have known this, but I didn't until 2 years ago: Thirty million workers have to sign noncompete agreements for the jobs they take."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Thirty million.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So a cashier at a burger place can't walk across town and take the same job at another burger place and make a few bucks more.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It just changed.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Well, they just changed it because we exposed it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"That was part of the deal, guys."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Look it up.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But not anymore.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they're worth.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And I must tell you, this is bound to get a response from my friends on my left, but the right."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'm so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Pass the PRO Act!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Because businesses have a right—workers have a right to form a union.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And let's guarantee all workers have a living wage.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Let's make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, affordable childcare."
2023,Biden,Democratic,That's going to enable millions of more people to go and stay at work.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And let's restore the full child tax credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half to the lowest level in history."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity, we increase economic growth."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"So let's finish the job and get more families access to affordable, quality housing."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's give more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the homecare services they need and support the workers who are doing God's work.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"These plans are fully paid for, and we can afford to do them."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Restoring the dignity of work means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"You know, when we made public education—12 years of it—universal in the last century, we made the best educated, best paid—we became the best education, best paid nation in the world."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But the rest of the world has caught up.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's caught up.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Jill, my wife, who teaches full-time, has an expression."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I hope I get it right, kid. [Laughter] ""Any nation that outeducates is going to outcompete us."" Any nation that outeducates is going to outcompete us."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, we all know 12 years of education is not enough to win the economic competition of the 21st century."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"If we want to have the best educated workforce, let's finish the job by providing access to preschool for 3 and 4 years old."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background they came from."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's give public school teachers a raise.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We're making progress by reducing student debt, increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Let's finish the job and connect students to career opportunities starting in high school, provide access to 2 years of community college, the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a 4-year degree."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Let's offer every American a path to a good career, whether they go to college or not."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And, folks—folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis, when schools were closed and we were shutting down everything, let's recognize how far we came in the fight against the pandemic itself."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people and the ingenuity of medicine, we've broken the COVID grip on us."
2023,Biden,Democratic,COVID deaths are down by 90 percent.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've saved millions of lives and opened up our country—we opened our country back up.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And soon, we'll end the public health emergency."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience member. [Inaudible] The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But—that's called a public health emergency.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But we'll remember the toll and pain that's never going to go away.
2023,Biden,Democratic,More than a million Americans lost their lives to COVID.
2023,Biden,Democratic,A million.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Families grieving.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Children orphaned.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Empty chairs at the dining room table constantly reminding you that she used to sit there.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Remembering them, we remain vigilant."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, we're also—got to double down prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Before I came to office, you remember, during that campaign, the big issue was about inspector generals who would protect taxpayers' dollars, who were sidelined."
2023,Biden,Democratic,They were fired.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Many people said, ""We don't need them."" And fraud became rampant."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Since then—since then, we've recovered billions of taxpayers' dollars."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Now let's triple the antifraud strike force going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars—billions of dollars—from the American people."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And the data shows that for every dollar we put into fighting fraud, the taxpayer will get back at least 10 times as much."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It matters.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It matters.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, COVID left its scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We have an obligation to make sure all people are safe.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Public safety depends on public trust, as all of us know."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But too often, that trust is violated."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols—welcome—[applause]—who had to bury Tyre last week.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"As many of you personally know, there's no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But imagine—imagine—if you lost that child at the hands of the law.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter came home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving a car.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Most of us in here have never had to have ""the talk""—""the talk""—that Brown and Black parents have had to have with their children."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Beau, Hunter, Ashley—my children—I never had to have the talk with them."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I never had to tell them: ""If a police officer pulls you over, turn your interior lights on right away."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Don't reach for your license.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Keep your hands on the steering wheel."" Imagine having to worry like that every single time your kid got in a car."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Here's what Tyre's mother shared with me when I spoke to her, when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"With the faith of God, she said her son was, quote, ""a beautiful soul"" and ""something good will come of this."" Imagine how much courage and character that takes."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"It's up to us, to all of us."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We all want the same thing: neighborhoods free of violence, law enforcement who earns the community's trust."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Just as every cop, when they pin on that badge in the morning, has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Our children have a right to come home safely.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Equal protection under the law is a covenant we have with each other in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We know police officers put their lives on the line every single night and day.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And we know we ask them, in many cases, to do too much—to be counselors, social workers, psychologists—responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and so much more."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"In one sense, we ask much too much of them."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I know most cops and their families are good, decent, honorable people—the vast majority."
2023,Biden,Democratic,That they risk—[applause].
2023,Biden,Democratic,And they risk their lives every time they put that shield on.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We have to do better.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Give law enforcement the real training they need.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Hold them to higher standards.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Help them to succeed in keeping them safe.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We also need more first responders and professionals to address the growing mental health, substance abuse challenges."
2023,Biden,Democratic,More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime.
2023,Biden,Democratic,More community intervention programs.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"More investments in housing, education, and job training."
2023,Biden,Democratic,All this can help prevent violence in the first place.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable."
2023,Biden,Democratic,With the support—[applause].
2023,Biden,Democratic,"With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an Executive order for all Federal officers, banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's commit ourselves to make the words of Tyler's [Tyre's; White House correction] mom true: Something good must come from this.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Something good.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And all of us—all of us—[applause].
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, it's difficult, but it's simple: All of us in the Chamber—in this Chamber, we need to rise to this moment."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We can't turn away.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's do what we know in our hearts that we need to do.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's come together to finish the job on police reform.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Do something.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Do something.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde—I met with every one of them—""Do something about gun violence."" Thank God—thank God—we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"That includes things like—that the majority of responsible gun owners already support: enhanced background checks for 18 to 21 years old, red-flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But we know our work is not done.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Brandon put his college dreams on hold—to be at his mom's side—his mom's side when she was dying from cancer.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And Brandon now works at the dance studio started by his grandparents.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And 2 weeks ago, during the Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio door close, and he saw a man standing there pointing a semiautomatic pistol at him."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"He thought he was going to die, but he thought about the people inside."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semiautomatic pistol away from the gunman who had already killed 11 people in another dance studio."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Eleven.
2023,Biden,Democratic,He saved lives.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's time we do the same.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Ban assault weapons now!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Ban them now!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Once and for all.
2023,Biden,Democratic,I led the fight to do that in 1994.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And in 10 years that ban was law, mass shootings went down."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"After we let it expire in a Republican administration, mass shootings tripled."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's finish the job and ban these assault weapons.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And let's also come together on immigration.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Make it a bipartisan issue once again.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We know—we now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers, seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've launched a new border plan last month.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97 percent as a consequence of that."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But American border problems won't be fixed until Congress acts.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"If we don't pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border—and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farmworkers, essential workers."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Here in ""the people's house,"" it's our duty to protect all the people's rights and freedoms."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Congress must restore the right and—— Audience member.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Secure the border!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience member. [Inaudible]—border!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members. [Inaudible] The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Congress must restore the right that was taken away in Roe v.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Wade and protect Roe v.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Wade.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Give every woman the constitutional right.
2023,Biden,Democratic,The Vice President and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But already, more than a dozen States are enforcing extreme abortion bans."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Make no mistake about it: If Congress passes a national ban, I will veto it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But let's also pass—let's also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Our strength—our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's remember: The world is watching.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I spoke from this Chamber 1 year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal attack against Ukraine, a murderous assault, evoking images of death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Putin's invasion has been a test for the ages—a test for America, a test for the world."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Would we stand for the most basic of principles?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Would we stand for sovereignty?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Would we stand for the right of people to live free of tyranny?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Would we stand for the defense of democracy?
2023,Biden,Democratic,For such defense matters to us because it keeps peace and prevents open season on would-be aggressors that threatens our prosperity.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"One year later, we know the answer."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Yes, we would."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we did.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We did.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And together, we did what America always does at our best."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We led.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We united NATO.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We built a global coalition.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We stood against Putin's aggression.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We stood with the Ukrainian people.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And tonight we're once again joined by Ukrainians' Ambassador to the United States.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"She represents not her—just her nation, but the courage of her people."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Ambassador is—our Ambassador is here, united in our—we're united in our support of your country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Will you stand so we can all take a look at you?
2023,Biden,Democratic,Thank you.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Because we're going to stand with you as long as it takes.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Our Nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Before I came to office, the story was about how the People's Republic of China was increasing its power and America was failing in the world."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We made clear and I made clear in my personal conversations, which have been many, with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But I will make no apologies that we're investing and—to make America stronger.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Investing in American innovation and industries that will define the future that China intends to be dominating.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect advanced technologies so they will not be used against us.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and determine—deter aggression.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Today, we're in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Anyone else in the world.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I'm committed—I'm committed—to work with China where we can advance American interests and benefit the world.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But make no mistake about it: As we made clear last week, if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we did.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, let's be clear: Winning the competition should unite all of us."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We face serious challenges across the world.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"But in the past 2 years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Name me a world leader who'd change places with Xi Jinping.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Name me one.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Name me one.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"America is rallying the world to meet those challenges, from climate to global health to food insecurity to terrorism to territorial aggression."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Allies are stepping up, spending more, and doing more."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Look, the bridges we're forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And those who bet against America are learning how wrong they are.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"It's never, ever been a good bet to bet against America."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Never.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2023,Biden,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2023,Biden,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Well—— Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2023,Biden,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2023,Biden,Democratic,U.S.A.!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"When I came to office, most assured that bipartisanship—assumed—was impossible."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But I never believed it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"That's why a year ago, I offered a unity agenda to the Nation as I stood here."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We made real progress together.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We passed the law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We passed the gun safety law, making historic investments in mental health."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We launched the ARPA-H drive for breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, and so much more."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named after the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I understand something about those burn pits.
2023,Biden,Democratic,But there is so much more to do.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we can do it together.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"He wrote Jill, my wife, a letter—and me as well—about his courageous daughter Courtney."
2023,Biden,Democratic,A contagious laugh.
2023,Biden,Democratic,His sister's best friend—her sister's best friend.
2023,Biden,Democratic,He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans and many of you in the audience.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Courtney discovered pills in high school.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It spiraled into addiction and eventually death from a fentanyl overdose.
2023,Biden,Democratic,She was just 20 years old.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Describing the last 8 years without her, Doug said, ""There is no worse pain."" Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end the stigma and change laws."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"He told us he wants to ""start a journey towards American recovery."" Doug, we're with you."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Big—— Audience members. [Inaudible]—the border.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,The border!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Big—you've got it.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience member. [Inaudible]—China!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Representative W.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Andrew Ogles IV.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's your fault!
2023,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2023,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So let's launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production and the sale and trafficking.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"With more drug detection machines, inspection cargo, stop pills and powder at the border."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Working with couriers, like FedEx, to inspect more packages for drugs."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Second, let's do more on mental health, especially for our children."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at their schools."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We must finally hold social media companies accountable for experimenting they're doing—running [on; White House correction] children for profit.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And it's time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data that companies collect on all of us."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Third, let's do more to keep this Nation's one fully sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Job training, job placement for veterans and their spouses as they come to—return to civilian life."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Helping veterans to afford their rent, because no one should be homeless in America, especially someone who served the country."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Denis McDonough is here, of the VA."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We had our first real discussion when I asked him to take the job.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I'm glad he did.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We were losing up to 25 veterans a day on suicide.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Now we're losing 17 a day to the silent scourge of suicide.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Seventeen veterans a day are committing suicide, more than all the people being killed in the wars."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screening, proven programs that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they're going through, get them the help they need."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We've got to do more.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And fourth, last year, Jill and I reignited the Cancer Moonshot that I was able to start with, and President Obama asked me to lead our administration on this issue."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Our goal is to cut the cancer death rates at least by 50 percent in the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases, provide more support for patients and their families."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"It's personal to so many of us, so many of us in this audience."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama."
2023,Biden,Democratic,They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I got married in New York City.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Kindred spirits.
2023,Biden,Democratic,He wrote us a letter about his little daughter Ava.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And I saw her just before I came over.
2023,Biden,Democratic,She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease—cancer.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"After 26 blood transfusions, 11 rounds of radiation, 8 rounds of chemo, 1 kidney removed, given a 5 percent survival rate."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"He wrote how, in the darkest moments, he thought, ""If she goes, I can't stay."" Many of you have been through that as well."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Jilly and I understand that, like so many of you."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And he read Jill's book describing our family's cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where we could with Beau.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For them, that glimmer of joy was the half-smile of their baby girl."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It meant everything to them.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"They never gave up hope, and little Ava never gave up hope."
2023,Biden,Democratic,She turns 4 next month.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"They just found out Ava is beating the odds, is on her way to being cured of cancer."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And she's watching from the White House tonight, if she's not asleep already."
2023,Biden,Democratic,For the lives we can save—[applause].
2023,Biden,Democratic,"For the lives we can save and the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and prove that we can still do big things."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, he undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's been a huge success.
2023,Biden,Democratic,He thought big.
2023,Biden,Democratic,He thought large.
2023,Biden,Democratic,He moved!
2023,Biden,Democratic,I believe we can do the same thing with cancer.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Let's end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, there's one reason why we've been able to do all of these things: our democracy itself."
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's the most fundamental thing of all.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"With democracy, everything is possible."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Without it, nothing is."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Over the last few years, our democracy has been threatened and attacked, put at risk—put to the test in this very room on January the 6th."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And then, just a few months ago, an unhinged ""big lie"" assailant unleashed a political violence at the home of the then-Speaker of the House of Representatives, using the very same language the insurrectionists used as they stalked these halls and chanted on January 6."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Here tonight, in this Chamber, is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and as strong and as resilient as they get: my friend, Paul Pelosi."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Paul, stand up."
2023,Biden,Democratic,But such a heinous act should have never happened.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We must all speak out.
2023,Biden,Democratic,There is no place for political violence in America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We have to protect the right to vote, not suppress the—that fundamental right."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We have to uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.
2023,Biden,Democratic,Democracy must not be a partisan issue.
2023,Biden,Democratic,It's an American issue.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Every generation of Americans have faced a moment where they have been called to protect our democracy, defend it, stand up for it."
2023,Biden,Democratic,And this is our moment.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point, one of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the direction we now take is going to decide the course of this Nation for decades to come."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're not bystanders of history.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're not powerless before the forces that confront us.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"It's within our power of ""We the People."" We're facing the test of our time."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We have to be the nation we've always been at our best: optimistic, hopeful, forward-looking; a nation that embraces light over dark, hope over fear, unity over division, stability over chaos."
2023,Biden,Democratic,"We have to see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're good people.
2023,Biden,Democratic,The only nation in the world built on an idea—the only one.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"Other nations are defined by geography, ethnicity, but we're the only nation based on an idea that all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God."
2023,Biden,Democratic,A nation that stands as a beacon to the world.
2023,Biden,Democratic,A nation in a new age of possibilities.
2023,Biden,Democratic,So I have come to fulfill my constitutional obligation to report on the state of the Union.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"And here is my report: Because the soul of this Nation is strong, because the backbone of this Nation is strong, because the people of this Nation are strong, the state of the Union is strong."
2023,Biden,Democratic,I'm not new to this place.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"I stand here tonight having served as long as about any one of you who have ever served here. [Laughter] But I've never been more optimistic about our future, about the future of America."
2023,Biden,Democratic,We just have to remember who we are.
2023,Biden,Democratic,We're the United States of America.
2023,Biden,Democratic,And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together.
2023,Biden,Democratic,"God bless you all, and may God protect our troops."
2023,Biden,Democratic,Thank you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union March 07, 2024 [Before speaking, the President presented his prepared remarks to Speaker of the House of Representatives J."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Michael Johnson.] The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Your bedtime reading.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Tony!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Thank you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Looking for Jill.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Good evening.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Good evening.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If I were smart, I'd go home now. [Laughter] Mr."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Speaker, Madam Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: In January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this Chamber to speak to the Nation."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And he said, ""I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union."" Hitler was on the march."
2024,Biden,Democratic,War was raging in Europe.
2024,Biden,Democratic,President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Tonight I come to the same Chamber to address the Nation.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Now it's we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.
2024,Biden,Democratic,What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack at—both at home and overseas at the very same time.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you: He will not."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But Ukraine—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,Ukraine can stop Putin.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That is all—that is all—Ukraine is asking.
2024,Biden,Democratic,They're not asking for American soldiers.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I'm determined to keep it that way."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But now assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It wasn't long ago when a Republican President named Ronald Reagan thundered, ""Mr."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" Now—[applause]."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Now my predecessor, a former Republican President, tells Putin, quote, ""Do whatever the hell you want."" Audience members."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's a quote.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"A former President actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous, and it's unacceptable."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War II prevent—to prevent war and keep the peace."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And today we've made NATO stronger than ever.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And just this morning Sweden officially joined, and their Minister is here tonight."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Come here, stand up."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Welcome.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Welcome, welcome, welcome."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And they know how to fight.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Mr.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Send me a bipartisan national security bill.
2024,Biden,Democratic,History is literally watching.
2024,Biden,Democratic,History is watching.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Europe is at risk.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"My message to President Putin, who I've known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We will not bow down.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I will not bow down.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In a literal sense, history is watching."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"History is watching, just like history watched 3 years ago on January 6, when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Many of you were here on that darkest of days.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people."
2024,Biden,Democratic,January 6 lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed a great—gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But they failed.
2024,Biden,Democratic,America stood—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,"America stood strong, and democracy prevailed."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We must be honest: The threat to democracy must be defended [defeated; White House correction].
2024,Biden,Democratic,My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I will not do that.
2024,Biden,Democratic,This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Here's the simple truth: You can't love your country only when you win.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"As I've done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you, without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Remember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Respect—respect—free and fair elections, restore trust in our institutions, and make clear political violence has absolutely no place—no place—in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Zero place.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Again, it's not hyperbole to suggest history is watching."
2024,Biden,Democratic,They're watching.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do.
2024,Biden,Democratic,History is watching another assault on freedom.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Joining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Fourteen months ago—fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"She scheduled treatments to have that second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Wade.
2024,Biden,Democratic,She was told her dream would have to wait.
2024,Biden,Democratic,What her family had gone through should never have happened.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Unless Congress acts, it could happen again."
2024,Biden,Democratic,So tonight let's stand up for families like hers.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To my friends across the aisle, don't keep this waiting any longer."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Guarantee the right to IVF.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Guarantee it nationwide.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Like most Americans, I believe Roe v."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Wade got it right.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more. [Applause] Thank you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Wade overturned.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"He's the reason it was overturned, and he brags about it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Look at the chaos that has resulted.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas."
2024,Biden,Democratic,She'd become pregnant again and had a fetus with a fatal condition.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have future in the—children in the future were at risk if she didn't act.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the State to get what she needed."
2024,Biden,Democratic,What her family had gone through should have never happened as well.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But it's happening to too many others.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"There are State laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their States to get the treatment they need."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Many of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"My God, what freedom else would you take away?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Look, its decision to overturn Roe v."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following—and with all due respect, Justices—""Women are not without electoral power""—excuse me—""electoral or political power."" You're about to realize just how much you were right about that."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Clearly—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Wade have no clue about the power of women.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But they found out.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And we'll win again in 2024.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If you—if you, the American people—send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I will restore Roe v."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Wade as the law of the land again.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, America cannot go back."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I am here tonight to show what I believe is the way forward, because I know how far we've come."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Four years ago next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Remember the fear, record losses?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate?
2024,Biden,Democratic,"A raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind."
2024,Biden,Democratic,A mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"A President, my predecessor, failed in the most basic Presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Representative Derrick Van Orden.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Lies!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I think that's unforgivable.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the Nation's history.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We have.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It doesn't make new, but in a—news—in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told."
2024,Biden,Democratic,So let's tell the story here—tell it here and now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"America's comeback is building a future of American possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; investing in all of America, in all Americans to make every—sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one—no one—behind."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The pandemic no longer controls our lives.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The vaccine that saved us from COVID is—are now being used to beat cancer.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Turning setback into comeback—that's what America does.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's what America does.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world: 15 million new jobs in just 3 years—a record, a record; unemployment at 50-year lows."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a literal act of hope, with historic job growth and small-business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian Americans."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in America and counting.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Where is it written we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world?
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We are, and we will."
2024,Biden,Democratic,More people have health insurance today—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,More people have health insurance today than ever before.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Wages keep going up.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Inflation keeps coming down.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent, the lowest in the world and tending [trending; White House correction] lower."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The landing is and will be soft.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs, right here in America, where they belong."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring. ""Buy America"" has been the law of the land since the 1930s."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Past administrations, including my predecessor—including some Democrats, as well, in the past—failed to buy American."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"On my watch, Federal projects that you fund—like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways—will be made with American products and built by American workers, creating good-paying American jobs."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And thanks to our CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles—and by the way, we invented those chips right here in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Well, instead of having to import them, instead of—private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don't require a college degree."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And thanks—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, I noticed some of you who've strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in. [Laughter] And I like it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm with you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm with you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And if any of you don't want that money in your district, just let me know. [Laughter] Modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems; removing poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage; providing affordable—affordable—high-speed internet for every American, no matter where you live—urban, suburban, or rural communities in red States and blue States; record investments in Tribal communities."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Because of my investment in family farms—[applause]—because I invested in family farms—led by my Secretary of Agriculture, who knows more about this than anybody I know—we're better able to stay in the family for the—those farms so their—and their children and grandchildren won't have to leave home to make a living."
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's transformative.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Hope was fading.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Then, I was elected to office, and we raised the Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies, knowing unions would make all the difference."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And together, we succeeded."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Instead of auto factories shutting down, auto factories are reopening, and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars there at the same—[applause]."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Folks—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To the folks of Belvidere, I say: Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Because instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building a future in Belvidere right here in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Here tonight is UAW President Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Shawn, where are you?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,Stand up.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And Dawn—and Dawn Simms, a third-generation worker—UAW worker at Belvidere."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Shawn, I was proud to be the first President to stand in the picket line."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown, providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Showing once again, Wall Street didn't build America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,They're not bad guys.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They didn't build it, though."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I say to the American people: When America gets knocked down, we get back up."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We keep going.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's America.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"That's you, the American people."
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's because of you America is coming back.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's because of you our future is brighter.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Four more years!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Four more years!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Four more years!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Tonight—tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the—all the tax breaks."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, I understand corporations."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I come from a State that has more corporations invested—[laughter]—than every one of your States in the State—the United States combined.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And I represented it for 36 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm not anticorporation.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn't put much on my dad's kitchen table.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's why I determined to turn things around so the middle class does well.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We all do well.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And there's more to do to make sure you're feeling the benefits of all we're doing.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It's wrong, and I'm ending it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,With a law that I proposed and signed—and not one of your Republican buddies work—voted for it—we finally beat Big Pharma.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin with diabetes—and it only costs 10 bucks to make—they only get paid $35 a month now and still make a healthy profit.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And I want to—and what to do next, I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it—everyone."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"For years, people have talked about it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But finally, we got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs, just like the VA is able to do for veterans."
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's not just saving seniors money.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's saving taxpayers money.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We cut the Federal deficit by $160 billion, because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"This year, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis."
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They're making a lot of money, guys."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And they'll still be extremely profitable.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It will not only save lives, it will save taxpayers another $200 billion."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Starting next year, the same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $200—at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, I'm going to get in trouble for saying that, but any of you want to get in Air Force One with me and fly to Toronto, Berlin, Moscow—I mean, excuse me. [Laughter] Well, even Moscow, probably. [Laughter] And bring your prescription with you, and I promise you, I'll get it for you for 40-percent the cost you're paying now."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Same company, same drug, same place."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, the Affordable Care Act—the old ""Obamacare""—is still a very big deal. [Laughter] Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But my predecessor and many in this Chamber want to take the—that prescription drug away by repealing Affordable Care Act.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm not going to let that happen.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We stopped you 50 times before, and we'll stop you again."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In fact, I'm not only protecting it, I'm expanding it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The—we enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year [to; White House correction] reduce health care costs for millions of working families.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That tax credit expires next year.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I want to make that savings permanent.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To state the obvious: Women are more than half of our population, but research on women's health has always been underfunded."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"That's why we're launching the first ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, led by Jill—doing an incredible job as First Lady—to pass my plan for $12 billion to transform women's health research and benefit millions of lives all across America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I know the cost of housing is so important to you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But I'm not waiting.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next 2 years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Just for 2 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And my administration is also eliminating title insurance [fees; White House correction] on federally backed mortgages.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"When you refinance your home, you can save $1,000 or more as a consequence."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"For millions of renters, we're cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law—using antitrust—who break antitrust laws—by price-fixing and driving up rents."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We've cut redtape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house—housing units nationwide."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Now pass—[applause]—now pass [my plan; White House correction] and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And I, like I suspect all of you, want to give a child—every child a good start by providing access to preschool for 3- and 4-years-old."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"You know, I think I pointed out last year—[applause]."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there's no books, they're not read to, not spoken to very often start school—kindergarten or first grade hearing—having heard a million fewer words spoken."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Well, studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- and 4-year degree no matter what their background is."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the Business Roundtable.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They were mad that I was ever—angry—I—well, they were discussing—[laughter]—why I wanted to spend money on education."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I pointed out to them: As Vice President, I met with over eight—I think it was 182 of those folks—don't hold me to the exact number—and I asked them what they need most—the CEOs."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And you've had the same experience on both sides of the aisle.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They say, ""A better educated workforce,"" right?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,So I looked at them.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And I say: ""I come from Delaware."
2024,Biden,Democratic,DuPont used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And every new enterprise they bought, they educated the workforce to that enterprise."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But none of you do that anymore.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated workforce in the world?"" And they all looked at me and said, ""I think you're right."" I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And I want to make sure that college is more affordable.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Let's continue increasing the Pell grants to working and middle class families and increase record investments in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic institutions."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"When I was told I couldn't universally just change the way in which we did—dealt with student loans, I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including nurses, firefighters, and others in public service."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Like Keenan Jones, a public educator in Minnesota, who's here with us tonight."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Keenan, where are you?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Keenan, thank you."
2024,Biden,Democratic,He's educated hundreds of students so they can go to college.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Now he's able to help, after debt forgiveness, get his own daughter to college."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And, folks, look, such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home, start a business, start a family."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And while we're at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And by the way, the first couple of years, we cut the deficit."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I've been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We've already cut the Federal deficit—[laughter].
2024,Biden,Democratic,We've already cut the Federal deficit over $1 trillion.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I signed a bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's my goal to cut the Federal deficit another $3 trillion by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Look, I'm a capitalist."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks, that's great."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Just pay your fair share in taxes.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"A fair Tax Code is how we invest in things that make this country great: health care, education, defense, and so much more."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But here's the deal.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent—the very wealthy—— Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President. ——and the biggest corporations—and exploded the Federal deficit.
2024,Biden,Democratic,They added more to the national debt than any Presidential term in American history.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Check the numbers.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks at home, does anybody really think the Tax Code is fair?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,No!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break?
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,No!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I sure don't.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal taxes—nobody—not one penny."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And they haven't yet.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In fact, the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Restore that child tax credit.
2024,Biden,Democratic,No child should go hungry in this country.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The way to make the Tax Code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in Federal income tax."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Zero.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Not anymore.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But that's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I also want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay when it was only supposed to be a million—a million dollars that could be deducted."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They can pay them $20 million if they want, but deduct a million."
2024,Biden,Democratic,End it now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"You know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,You know what the average Federal tax is for those billionaires?
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience member.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Zero!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,No. [Laughter] They're making great sacrifices—8.2 percent.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"No billionaire should pay a lower Federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires of 25 percent—just 25 percent.
2024,Biden,Democratic,You know what that would raise?
2024,Biden,Democratic,That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And imagine what that could do for America.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Imagine a future with affordable childcare, millions of families can get what they need to go to work to help grow the economy."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Imagine a future with paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Imagine—imagine—a future with home care and eldercare, and people's living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Tonight let's all agree once again to stand up for seniors.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The working people—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,The working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's not fair.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We have two ways to go.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I will—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's the proposal.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Oh, no?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,You guys don't want another $2 trillion tax cut?
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience member.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Liar!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I kind of thought that's what your plan was. [Laughter] Well, that's good to hear."
2024,Biden,Democratic,You're not going to cut another $2 trillion for the superwealthy?
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's good to hear.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Look—— Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Joe!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Joe!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Joe!
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The President. ——too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"That's why we're cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing, from food to health care to housing."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In fact, the snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer—[laughter]—same size bag—put fewer chips in it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"No, I'm not joking."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It's called ""shrink-flation."" Pass Bobby Casey's bill, and stop this."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I really mean it.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"You probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars. [Laughter] And you get—you get charged the same amount, and you've got about, I don't know, 10-percent fewer Snickers in it. [Laughter] Look, I'm also getting rid of junk fees, those hidden fees at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge."
2024,Biden,Democratic,My administration announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Banks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what it costs them to instigate the collection.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And that's more—a hell of a lot like $8 than 30-some dollars.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But they don't like it.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The credit card companies don't like it, but I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I'm eliminating."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks at home, that's why the banks are so mad."
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's $20 billion in profit.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm not stopping there.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"My administration has proposed rules to make cable, travel, utilities, and online ticket sellers tell you the total price up front so there are no surprises."
2024,Biden,Democratic,It matters.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It matters.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And so does this.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Oh, you don't think so?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Oh, you don't like that bill—huh?—that conservatives got together and said was a good bill?"
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'll be darned.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's amazing.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now."
2024,Biden,Democratic,What are you against?
2024,Biden,Democratic,One hundred more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles smuggling fentanyl into America that's killing thousands of children.
2024,Biden,Democratic,This bill would save lives and bring order to the border.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It would also give me and any new President new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The Border Patrol union has endorsed this bill. [At this point, members of the audience spoke over the President.] The Federal Chamber of Commerce has—yes, yes."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"You're saying ""no."" Look at the facts. [Laughter] I know—[applause]."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I know you know how to read.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I believe that given the opportunity—for—a majority in the House and Senate would endorse the bill as well—a majority right now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience member.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Yes!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But unfortunately, politics has derailed this bill so far."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm told my predecessor called Members of Congress in the Senate to demand they block the bill.
2024,Biden,Democratic,He feels political win—he viewed it as a—it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's not about him.
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's not about me.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'd be a winner—not really.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I—— Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.
2024,Biden,Democratic,What about Laken Riley? [Members of the audience spoke over the President.] Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Rep.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Greene.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Say her name! [The President held up a pin reading: ""Say Her Name, Laken Riley.""] The President."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Lanken—Lanken [Laken; White House correction] Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Rep.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Greene.
2024,Biden,Democratic,By an illegal!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,By an illegal.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's right.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But how many of thousands of people are being killed by legals? [Members of the audience spoke over the President.] To her parents, I say: My heart goes out to you."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Having lost children myself, I understand."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But look, if we change the dynamic at the border—people pay people—people pay these smugglers 8,000 bucks to get across the border because they know if they get by—if they get by and let into the country, it's 6 to 8 years before they have a hearing."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And it's worth the—taking the chance of the $8,000. [Members of the audience spoke over the President.] But—but—if it's only 6 months—6 weeks, the idea is it's highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they'll be—able to be kicked out quickly."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Folks, I would respectfully suggest to my friend in—my Republican friends owe it to the American people."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Get this bill done.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We need to act now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Get it done!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Get it done!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Get it done!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience member.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Build the wall.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And if my predecessor is watching: Instead of paying [playing; White House correction] politics and pressuring Members of Congress to block the bill, join me in telling the Congress to pass it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We can do it together.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But that's what he apparently—here's what he will not do.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I will not demonize immigrants, saying they are ""poison in the blood of our country."" I will not separate families."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I will not ban people because of their faith.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Take a look at it.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for ""Dreamers,"" and so much more."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But, unlike my predecessor, I know who we are as Americans."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We're the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Home to Native Americans whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Home to people of every place—from every place on Earth.
2024,Biden,Democratic,They came freely.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Some came in chains.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Some came when famine struck, like my ancestral family in Ireland."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Some to flee persecution, to chase dreams that are impossible anywhere but here in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's America.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And we all come from somewhere, but we're all Americans."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Look, folks, we have a simple choice: We can fight about fixing the border, or we can fix it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm ready to fix it.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Send me the border bill now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Fix it!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Fix it!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Fix it!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"A transformational history—moment in history happened 58—59 years ago today in Selma, Alabama."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Hundreds of foot soldiers for justice marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, to claim their fundamental right to vote."
2024,Biden,Democratic,They were beaten.
2024,Biden,Democratic,They were bloodied and left for dead.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Our late friend and former colleague John Lewis was on that march.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We miss him.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But joining us tonight are other marchers, both in the gallery and on the floor, including Bettie Mae Fikes, known as the ""Voice of Selma."" The daughter of gospel singers and preachers, she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday to help shake the Nation's conscience."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Five months later, the Voting Rights Act passed and was signed into law."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Thank you.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But 59 years later, there are forces taking us back in time: voter suppression, election subversion, unlimited dark money, extreme gerrymandering."
2024,Biden,Democratic,John Lewis was a great friend to many of us here.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"But if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes who marched with him, then it's time to do more than talk."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Pass the Freedom To Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Right [Rights; White House correction] Act."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And stop—stop denying another core value of America: our diversity across American life.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Banning books, it's wrong."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Instead of erasing history, let's make history."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I want to protect fundamental rights.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Pass the Equality Act.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And my message to transgender Americans is, I have your back."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Pass the PRO Act for workers' rights.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Raise the Federal minimum wage, because every worker has the right to a decent living more than eight—7 bucks an hour."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We're also making history by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I don't think any of you think there's no longer a climate crisis.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"At least, I hope you don't. [Laughter] I'm taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I'm cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030, creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs, like the IBEW workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; conserving 30 percent of America's lands and waters by 2030; and taking action on environmental justice—fenceline communities smothered by the legacy of pollution."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And patterned after the Peace Corps and AmericaCorps [AmeriCorps; White House correction], I launched the Climate Corps to put 20,000 young people to work in the forefront of our clean energy future."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'll triple that number in a decade.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To state the obvious, all Americans deserve the freedom to be safe."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And America is safer today than when I took office.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The year before I took office, murder rates went up 30 percent."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Norco, CA, resident and Gold Star father Steven Nikoui."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Remember Abbey Gate!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Thirty percent, they went up—— Mr."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Nikoui.
2024,Biden,Democratic,United States Marines!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Kareem Mae'Lee Nikoui!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President. ——the biggest increase in history.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Mr.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Nikoui. [Inaudible] The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"It was then, through no—through my American Rescue Plan—which every American [Republican; White House correction] voted against, I might add—we made the largest investment in public safety ever."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Last year, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But we have more to do.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We have to help cities invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, more community violence intervention."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Keep building trust, as I've been doing, by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Directing my Cabinet to review the Federal classification of marijuana and expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession, because no one should be jailed for simply using or have it on their record."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Take on crimes of domestic violence.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm ramping up the Federal enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act that I proudly wrote when I was a Senator so we can finally—finally end the scourge against women in America.
2024,Biden,Democratic,There are other kinds of violence I want to stop.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"With us tonight is Jazmin whose 9-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers in her elementary school in Uvalde, Texas."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Very soon after that happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde for a couple days."
2024,Biden,Democratic,We spent hours and hours with each of the families.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We heard their message so everyone in this room, in this Chamber could hear the same message."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"The constant refrain—and I was there for hours, meeting with every family."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They said, ""Do something."" ""Do something."" Well, I did do something by establishing the first ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the White House, that the Vice President is leading the charge."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Thank you for doing it.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Meanwhile—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he's proud he did nothing on guns when he was President."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"After another shooting in Iowa recently, he said—when asked what to do about it, he said, just ""get over it."" That was his quote."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Just ""get over it."" I say stop it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Stop it, stop it, stop it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm proud we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We now must beat the NRA again.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Pass universal background checks.
2024,Biden,Democratic,None of this—none of this—I taught the Second Amendment for 12 years.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners. [Members of the audience spoke over the President.] You know, as we manage challenges at home, we're also managing crises abroad, including in the Middle East."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I know the last 5 months have been gut-wrenching for so many people: for the Israeli people, for the Palestinian people, and so many here in America."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"This crisis began on October 7 with a massacre by a terrorist group called Hamas, as you all know."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"One thousand two hundred innocent people—women and girls, men and boys—slaughtered after enduring sexual violence."
2024,Biden,Democratic,The deadliest day of the—for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And 250 hostages taken.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Here in this Chamber tonight are families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We also—we will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul, Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians—and others around the world."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Israel has a right to go after Hamas.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Hamas ended this conflict by releasing the hostages, laying down arms—could end it by releasing the hostages, laying down arms, and surrendering those responsible for October 7."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But Israel has a—excuse me.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards, under hospitals, daycare centers, and all the like."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Israel also has a fundamental responsibility, though, to protect innocent civilians in Gaza."
2024,Biden,Democratic,This war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed—— Audience member."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Says who?
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President. ——most of whom are not Hamas.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Thousands and thousands of innocents—women and children.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Girls and boys also orphaned.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displacement.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Homes destroyed, neighborhoods in rubble, cities in ruin."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Families without food, water, medicine."
2024,Biden,Democratic,It's heartbreaking.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I've been working nonstop to establish an immediate cease-fire that would last for 6 weeks to get all the prisoners released—all the hostages released and to get the hostages home and ease the intolerable and—humanitarian crisis and build toward an enduring—a more—something more enduring.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The United States has been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Tonight I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelters."
2024,Biden,Democratic,No U.S. boots will be on the ground.
2024,Biden,Democratic,A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And Israel must do its part.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren't caught in the crossfire.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And they're announcing they're going to—they're going to have a crossing in Northern Gaza.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To the leadership of Israel, I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel, my entire career."
2024,Biden,Democratic,No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I challenge any of you here.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm the only American President to visit Israel in wartime.
2024,Biden,Democratic,But there is no other path that guarantees Israel's security and democracy.
2024,Biden,Democratic,There is no other path that guarantees that Palestinians can live in peace with—with peace and dignity.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And there is no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, with whom I'm talking."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran.
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's why I built a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I've ordered strikes to degrade the Houthi capability and defend U.S. forces in the region.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"As Commander in Chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"For years, I've heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind."
2024,Biden,Democratic,They've got it backwards.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I've been saying it for over 4 years, even when I wasn't President."
2024,Biden,Democratic,America is rising.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We have the best economy in the world.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And since I've come to office, our GTB [GDP; White House correction] is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And we're standing up against China's unfair economic practices.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We're standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I've revitalized our partnership and alliance in the Pacific: India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Pacific Islands."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China—not allowing to trade them there.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I want competition with China, not conflict."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And we're in a stronger position to win the conflict [competition; White House correction] of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter—than at any time as well.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Here at home, I've signed over 400 bipartisan bills."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But there's more to pass my unity agenda.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience member.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Boo!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"You don't want to do that, huh? [Laughter] Pass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Harness—[applause].
2024,Biden,Democratic,Harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Ban AI voice impersonations and more.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"That's why, with the strong support and help of Denis and the VA, I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever, helping millions of veterans exposed to toxins who now are battling more than 100 different cancers."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Many of them don't come home, but we owe them and their families support."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"And we owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H—and remind us—to remind us that we can do big things, like end cancer as we know it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And we will.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Let me close with this. [Applause] Yay! [Laughter] I know you don't want to hear anymore, Lindsey, but I've got to say a few more things. [Laughter] I know I may not look like it, but I've been around a while. [Laughter] When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I know the American story.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Again and again, I've seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our Nation, between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that have defined America—honesty, decency, dignity, and equality—to respect everyone; to give everyone a fair shot; to give hate no safe harbor."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Now, other people my age see it differently. [Laughter] The American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution."
2024,Biden,Democratic,That's not me.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I was born amid World War II, when America stood for the freedom of the world."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, among working class people who built this country."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I watched in horror as two of my heroes—like many of you did—Dr.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"King and Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And their legacies inspired me to pursue a career of service.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I left a law firm and became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr.
2024,Biden,Democratic,King was assassinated because of the riots.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And I became a county councilman almost by accident.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running, at age 29."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Then Vice President to our first Black President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Now a President to the first woman Vice President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"In my career, I've been told I was too young. [Laughter] By the way, they didn't let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"They—not a joke. [Laughter] And I've been told I am too old. [Laughter] Whether young or old, I've always been known—I've always known what endures."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I've known our North Star.
2024,Biden,Democratic,The very idea of America is that we're all created equal—deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"We've never fully lived up to that idea, but we've never walked away from it either."
2024,Biden,Democratic,And I won't walk away from it now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I'm optimistic.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I really am.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I'm optimistic, Nancy."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Audience members.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Four more years!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Four more years!
2024,Biden,Democratic,Four more years!
2024,Biden,Democratic,The President.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"My fellow Americans, the issue facing our Nation isn't how old we are, it's how old are our ideas."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas."
2024,Biden,Democratic,But you can't lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"To lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done."
2024,Biden,Democratic,Tonight you've heard mine.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I see a future where [we're; White House correction] defending democracy, you don't diminish it."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I see a future where the middle class has—finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes.
2024,Biden,Democratic,I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Above all, I see a future for all Americans."
2024,Biden,Democratic,I see a country for all Americans.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And I will always be President for all Americans because I believe in America.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"I believe in you, the American people."
2024,Biden,Democratic,You're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future than I am now.
2024,Biden,Democratic,So let's build the future together.
2024,Biden,Democratic,Let's remember who we are.
2024,Biden,Democratic,We are the United States of America.
2024,Biden,Democratic,And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together.
2024,Biden,Democratic,"God bless you all, and may God protect our troops."
2024,Biden,Democratic,"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
