You are assessing the severity of hate or violent speech in State of the Union address paragraphs. These are formal presidential speeches to Congress and the American public with massive reach and influence.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- These are State of the Union addresses by U.S. Presidents (1945-2024)
- Speakers have the highest political authority and influence in the nation
- Speeches are broadcast nationally with enormous public reach
- Even subtle rhetoric can influence millions and shape national discourse
- The formal setting does NOT diminish the impact of divisive or violent language
- Be SENSITIVE to coded language, othering, us-vs-them framing, and enemy construction

Use the six-part Rabat Plan of Action framework:
1. Context: National address, massive audience, presidential authority
2. Speaker: Highest political office, commander-in-chief, sets national tone
3. Intent: Look for patterns of othering, scapegoating, threat construction
4. Content/Form: Dehumanization, enemy framing, militaristic language, exclusionary rhetoric
5. Extent: Maximum reach - national broadcast, historical record, policy implications
6. Likelihood of harm: Presidential speech can legitimize discrimination, shape policy, influence public attitudes

CALIBRATED SCORING SCALE (0-10):

0 = Pure platitudes, ceremonial language, completely neutral procedural statements
    Example: "Thank you for gathering tonight" or "The state of our union is strong"

1 = General policy discussion without targeting groups, mild partisan rhetoric
    Example: "We must reduce spending" or "The opposition's approach won't work"

2 = Mild us-vs-them framing, vague external threats, partisan criticism
    Example: "Our enemies watch us" or "Those who oppose this don't understand"

3 = Clear in-group/out-group division, identifying adversaries, mild othering
    Example: "Criminal elements threaten our way of life" or "Foreign powers seek to undermine us"

4 = Explicit enemy identification, threat framing of specific groups, tough rhetoric
    Example: "Illegal immigrants bring crime" or "Radical elements must be stopped"

5 = Strong adversarial language, dehumanizing metaphors, calls for aggressive action
    Example: "We will crush our enemies" or describing groups as threats/invaders

6 = Explicit dehumanization, militaristic language toward groups, enemy othering
    Example: War rhetoric directed at populations, describing people as dangerous/subhuman

7 = Strong incitement language, clear calls for hostile action against groups
    Example: Explicitly calling for removal, exclusion, or aggressive measures against populations

8 = Severe dehumanization, explicit threat construction, incitement to discrimination
    Example: Describing groups as existential threats requiring elimination from society

9 = Direct incitement to hostility/violence, genocide-adjacent rhetoric
    Example: Calling for violent action, describing groups as needing to be destroyed

10 = Explicit calls for genocide, mass violence, or killings
     Example: Direct advocacy for extermination or mass killing of populations

SCORING GUIDANCE:
- Score 0 ONLY for purely ceremonial/procedural statements with zero political content
- Most policy discussions should score 1-3 (they involve framing, choices, implicit values)
- Any mention of threats, enemies, or adversaries should score 3+
- Strong us-vs-them or militaristic language should score 4-6
- Dehumanization or explicit calls for hostile action score 7+
- DO NOT default to 0 - use the full scale
- Presidential rhetoric carries weight - score accordingly

CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return ONLY a single number between 0 and 10
- If truly no political content exists, return: NA
- Do NOT include any other text, explanation, rationale, or commentary
- Do NOT add any punctuation, words, or formatting
- Your entire response must be ONLY the score number or NA

Remember: Use the FULL scale. Score 0 is RARE. Most political speech should score 1-4.
