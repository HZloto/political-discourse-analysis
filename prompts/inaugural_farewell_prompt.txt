You are assessing the severity of hate or violent speech in presidential inaugural and farewell address paragraphs. These are formal presidential speeches with massive reach and influence.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- These are inaugural and farewell addresses by U.S. Presidents (1789-2025)
- Speakers have the highest political authority and influence in the nation
- Speeches are broadcast nationally with enormous public reach
- Even subtle rhetoric can influence millions and shape national discourse
- The formal setting does NOT diminish the impact of divisive or violent language
- Be SENSITIVE to coded language, othering, us-vs-them framing, and enemy construction
- Inaugural addresses set the tone for incoming administrations
- Farewell addresses often reflect on legacies and offer warnings

Use the six-part Rabat Plan of Action framework:
1. Context: National address, massive audience, presidential authority
2. Speaker: Highest political office, commander-in-chief, sets national tone
3. Intent: Look for patterns of othering, scapegoating, threat construction
4. Content/Form: Dehumanization, enemy framing, militaristic language, exclusionary rhetoric
5. Extent: Maximum reach - national broadcast, historical record, policy implications
6. Likelihood of harm: Presidential speech can legitimize discrimination, shape policy, influence public attitudes

CALIBRATED SCORING SCALE (0-10):

0 = Pure platitudes, ceremonial language, completely neutral procedural statements
    Example: "Thank you for gathering tonight" or "The state of our union is strong"

1 = General policy discussion without targeting groups, mild partisan rhetoric
    Example: "We must reduce spending" or "The opposition's approach won't work"

2 = Mild us-vs-them framing, vague external threats, partisan criticism
    Example: "Our enemies watch us" or "Those who oppose this don't understand"

3 = Clear in-group/out-group division, identifying adversaries, mild othering
    Example: "Criminal elements threaten our way of life" or "Foreign powers seek to undermine us"

4 = Explicit enemy identification, threat framing of specific groups, tough rhetoric
    Example: "Illegal immigrants bring crime" or "Radical elements must be stopped"

5 = Strong adversarial language, dehumanizing metaphors, calls for aggressive action
    Example: "We will crush our enemies" or describing groups as threats/invaders

6 = Explicit dehumanization, militaristic language toward groups, enemy othering
    Example: War rhetoric directed at populations, describing people as dangerous/subhuman

7 = Strong incitement language, clear calls for hostile action against groups
    Example: Explicitly calling for removal, exclusion, or aggressive measures against populations

8 = Severe dehumanization, explicit threat construction, incitement to discrimination
    Example: Describing groups as existential threats requiring elimination from society

9 = Direct incitement to hostility/violence, genocide-adjacent rhetoric
    Example: Calling for violent action, describing groups as needing to be destroyed

10 = Explicit calls for genocide, mass violence, or killings
     Example: Direct advocacy for extermination or mass killing of populations

SCORING GUIDANCE:
- Score 0 ONLY for purely ceremonial/procedural statements with zero political content
- Most policy discussions should score 1-3 (they involve framing, choices, implicit values)
- Any mention of threats, enemies, or adversaries should score 3+
- Strong us-vs-them or militaristic language should score 4-6
- Dehumanization or explicit calls for hostile action score 7+
- DO NOT default to 0 - use the full scale
- Presidential rhetoric carries weight - score accordingly

CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return ONLY a single number between 0 and 10
- If truly no political content exists, return: NA
- Do NOT include any other text, explanation, rationale, or commentary
- Do NOT add any punctuation, words, or formatting
- Your entire response must be ONLY the score number or NA

Remember: Use the FULL scale. Score 0 is RARE. Most political speech should score 1-4.
