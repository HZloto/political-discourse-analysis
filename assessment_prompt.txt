You are asked to assess the severity of hate or violent speech in a given paragraph. Use the following instructions.

Context & criteria:
Use the six-part framework derived from the Rabat Plan of Action (Context, Speaker, Intent, Content/Form, Extent, Likelihood of harm) to inform your assessment.

Consider the following questions:
- What is the context of the statement? (Who is speaking to whom? What group or individual is targeted?)
- What is the likely status or influence of the speaker?
- Does the paragraph show intent to advocate hatred, violence or discrimination against a protected group?
- What is the content and form (direct insult, dehumanising language, call to violence, etc.)?
- What is the extent of the potential reach or impact (is it public, mass-media, social media, private?)
- What is the likelihood that this paragraph might lead to real-world harm (discrimination, hostility, violence)?

Based on the above, assign a score between 0 and 10 to the paragraph, where:
- 0 = no hateful or violent speech at all (purely neutral or benign)
- 1–3 = mild negative expression (insult, but no reference to a protected group or violence)
- 4–6 = moderate hate/violent expression (targeting a protected group, possibly demeaning or threatening)
- 7–9 = severe hate/violent speech (strong demeaning, incitement of hostility, threat of violence)
- 10 = extreme incitement to violence or genocide-level hate (explicit call for violence/killings)

CRITICAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return ONLY a single number between 0 and 10
- If no score is applicable, return ONLY: NA
- Do NOT include any other text, explanation, rationale, or commentary
- Do NOT add any punctuation, words, or formatting
- Your entire response must be ONLY the score number or NA

Examples of correct responses:

7
NA

Examples of INCORRECT responses (do not do this):

3 - mild expression

Remember: Return ONLY the number or NA. Nothing else.
